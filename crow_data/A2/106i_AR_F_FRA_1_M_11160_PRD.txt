Astronomy: Our Remedy for the Future 
There is a lot of controversy about whether astrophysics, astronomy, or space exploration is meaningful and useful to our society. It requires not only large sums of money for its funding, but also life-long dedication from some of the brightest minds on the planet to practice these subjects, and yet there seems, according to the general population, to be very little impact on our lives. Therefore many questions are raised about the reasons why they should ever be studied in the place of more directly useful sciences, in which one may include social sciences or political sciences. However, as of today, many reasons exist and compel, whether they be historical, empirical, theoretical, or religious; and beyond these, there is even a belief, if not an eventuality, that Astronomy may be our salvation as a species in the future. Astrophysics is a field of study that presents many advantages to both our current society and future ones, in direct and subtle ways, and it is therefore very important for us to keep on studying it. 
Firstly, we may remind ourselves of the very important role astronomy has played in our species history. There is a myriad of examples of civilizations and cultures of the ancient times in which astronomy was a central pillar, some even persisting until today. Indeed, some of the earliest archeological evidence of human presence dating before around 30,000 years ago that have been found today are astronomical in nature: a Stone Age amulet representing the Ursa Major constellation Great Bear engraved presumably 30 to 40 thousand years ago M. W. Makemson, 1954. Noteworthy is the fact that the way the age of that amulet was determined is through its content: "the relative positions of the stars point to a very great antiquity for the amulet" Makemson, 1954, p. 163, given that "the form of the constellation was not merely due to carelessness on the part of the engraver," which is "proved by the meticulous care with which he has indicated the difference in brightness of the stars" Makemson, 1954, p. 164. This goes to show how precise this work of simply representing the stars on stone was, implying that astronomy that is what it is must have been of great importance to the earliest humans. Another example of the use of astronomy in ancient society of which we now have extensive evidence is that of the Babylonian civilization of around 1500-1000 BC. Babylonians studied the positions of the moon, and used its movement patterns around the Earth to set up a lunisolar calendar consisting of 12 months. That way, astronomers directly impacted the life of all citizens of Babylon.
