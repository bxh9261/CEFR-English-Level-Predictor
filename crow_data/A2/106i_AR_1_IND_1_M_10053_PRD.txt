Imagine a world where you could go around the world in an airplane twice or maybe even thrice without stopping or refueling. Imagine paying only about $30-$50 for an airplane ticket. Yes, it might sound too farfetched but it will be possible in the future sooner than one might imagine. Researches and tests are being conducted on the use of solar energy in airplanes and many of the researches show positive results. With the use of solar energy in planes, they no more require jet fuel to power the engines, and by using only the sun's energy to power the engines, in theory one could fly on forever! Solar power is nothing new to mankind. It has been around since a very long time. It has been used in houses for heating purposes for a long time and has been in use for several other purposes. But using solar energy in airplanes is a relatively new concept. Through various researches and studies, it has been found that solar power can be used in airplanes but with certain limitations.
