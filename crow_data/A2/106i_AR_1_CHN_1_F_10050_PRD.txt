How do sports and exercises affect academia? 
In modern society, exercise and sports seem as an indivisible part in daily life, because it provides a variety of benefits to human being. The major advantages are strengthening people's physical health and helping one's to build better personality. Even more, there is a saying that physical exercises can make people become smarter because the regular aerobic activity leads to changes in brain associated with improved cognition, and lead people perform better on academic. Whereas a variety of people think that participating in exercises and sports will distract one's from study. Base on this topic, I did some related online research and collected some data from interviewing a sport expert. In my opinion, I believe the physical exercises have positive effects on academia.
