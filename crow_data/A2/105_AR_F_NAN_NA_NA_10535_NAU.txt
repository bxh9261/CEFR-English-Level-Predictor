Homeschooling
What is the best to our children homeschooling or public and private schools? This question is very important for every parent and family even for the all country around the world. And because the children are the one who will raise their family and their country. The problem is how we will make our children have the best education and information that will help them to be a useful for their community. And a lot of country in the world educates their children in public or private schools especially here in America except some parents who don't think that public schools are the best choice for their children. So they start homeschool their children.
Homeschooling means that parent will educate their children in their homes without sending them into the public or private schools. About homeschooling, it was very rare to teach the children in their homes or in other word homeschooling. In 1960s, it was a little number of children who had homeschooling and they don't reach 10.000. In the graph below shows the increasing in the number of homeschooling children.
In the spring of the 2007s, the homeschooling children are increasing until they reach 1. 5 million students. But the question is why people start homeschooling their children? Some of them think that they can teach their children better than teachers in the public schools, another parent chose to homeschool their children because they think that public schools don't give the children the best education. Some parent think that their children are not safe in public schools that why they educate their children in their homes.
The issue in this situation is what is the best for our children future homeschooling or public schools? Some of the people said that public schools are better than homeschooling. In the other side, some people said that homeschooling is better that public school. If we see the researches and the studies show that no difference in the children who had homeschooling and the other who study in public schools and private schools. Moreover, some studies show that children who had homeschooling are better than children who study in public or private schools. Because, they have a very good ways to learn in their homes.
Homeschooling is dealing with each child alone which is better than teaching group of children. Because the teacher or the parent will focus on one child and they can make sure if that child is understand what he learned. "One of the primary benefits of homeschooling is the ability to tailor the education to the needs of each student and to work one-on-one with the child" (Ann Zeise). That's mean the child will have the information alone without anyone around him and that make him understand the information very well. Another benefits is that even the children did not understand the information very well it can be repeated again not like the public schools which sometimes the teacher cannot repeat the information for all the student in the class because the of the time. This is one benefit of homeschooling for the children who had it.
Homeschooling parents have access to a rich variety of learning materials and opportunities. Researchers at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) found, in a national 2003 survey, that "forty-one percent of students who were homeschooled in 2003 engaged in some sort of distance learning . . . . Approximately 20 percent of homeschooled students took a course or received instruction provided by television, video, or radio". It shows that homeschooling have the variety of teaching the children which is better than setting in the chairs in just receiving the information in all the semester. For example, the online teaching in the colleges is mirrored by online instruction in the homeschool community. In the same survey shows that about 19 percent of homeschooled students had taken a course or received instruction provided over the Internet, e-mail, or the World Wide Web. In this situation means that children educated sometimes by professionals like the high education students who study in colleges, and this can make the children think well than other students who studies in public schools and that thing make them deal with their professors well when they are in colleges because they will be accustomed with it when they were a child.
Another thing that makes homeschooling better is the customization of curriculum. And these varieties help the children especially in the science. And sometimes children cannot understand the science very well so parent can find another book or other materials can make the child understand what he read. Also parents will teach their child as individualization or differentiated instruction if they don't want to change the book or the materials, so they can take instruction for someone professional and they will help them to make their children understand what they need (Ray, 2002).
One nation study collected data from 1,952 homeschooled students across the country and the study showed that the average of the scores in every test category (reading, listening, language, math, science, social studies, study skills, etc.) is eightieth (Brian). In other word, the study showed that children who had homeschooling have higher scores that the children had homeschooling. According to the Countryside & Small Stock Journal which showed that, children how had homeschooling will improve faster and they had scores better than other children how went to the public schools (Stone, 2011). A report published by the Educational Resources Information Center shows that homeschool test scores are better and higher than public and private schools. And it also shows that an eighth grade child how get homeschooled is four years ahead not like the child in public or private schools. And the graph below shows the national average scores between homeschooling and public schools.
Another thing in makes homeschooling better is because the children's homes are the safest place for them. And a lot of the parents start homeschooling their children because they see a lot of crimes can happen in the schools like drugs, homicides, crimes of rape, and sometimes suicides. Besides, sometimes children can have a bad peer group which will effect on the child. In other word, parents start homeschooling their children because they scared on their children from the negative influence which can happen from the peer group. Moreover, that crimes can happen not only for students but sometimes it can happen for the teachers and the employers who work in the school either. (Kantrowitz &Wingert, 1998).
Numerous studies in California showed that the income of the family cannot effect on the academic performance of homeschooled students. Because, they don't look at other students and don't see the difference between them and other students who had better incoming. That's mean they will focus more in their study. However, if we look at the public schools we can find that some student have better incoming than others and that makes the students with low incoming family don't focus in their study because they see the difference appear between them like the sun.
This recognition is not surprising. The illustrated data appearances that the students who had homeschooling attends to the colleges more than the other students who had study in public schools. A nationwide study of 4,129 adults who had been homeschooled for seven years had a higher education levels compared to the other adults who had study in public or private schools. " 50.2% of homeschooled adults, aged eighteen to twenty-four, had obtained some college education compared to 34% of the general population in this age range..8.7% had obtained an associate's degree, compared to 4.1% of the general population; and 11.8% had obtained a bachelor's degree, compared to 7.6% of the general population" (Jones & Gloeckner).
The parents can focus more on what their child strength and weaknesses. As well as they will try to improve the weaknesses that their children have besides help them to be in that same level in strength side the children have. Therefore, it will help the children to improve their academic performance. In addition, not only in the academic, they will help them to improve in all aspects of life such as if their children cannot be more social then they will help the child to talk more and they are the best as a parents because they know what their children needs to improve. Also, that thing can help the child to be successful in his life too. In other word, they will make their children face the success in the academic performance and in his social life (Rivero, 2002).
Some parents and their children are very comfortable because the flexibility of homeschooling. And it can reflect on the way that how they teach their children, or in the schedule that they but to their children. Besides, they can change the schedule anytime they want to match with what they want depend on their daily life and what they need from day to another. And this flexibility will make the parents and their children more comfortable and can make them parent teach their child well and the child will receive the information better. But in public or private schools the students miss that because they forced by one schedule and they need to participate with it all the semester. And this is one advantages of homeschooling (Neal, 2006).
Some people who against homeschooling said that homeschooling make the children or the students cannot deal well with the other or in their daily life if they are away from their parents. in other word they have Social Misfits. And they believe that because they said that the children who have homeschooling are isolated from the other and they don't meet a lot of people every day and the children don't receive adequate socialization experiences. But in reality the parent are aware of this problem. And they can admitted their children in different activity like scouting, dance classes, group sports, 4-H, and volunteer work, demonstrating that homeschoolers are not isolated from the outside world. "Homeschooled children are involved in numerous activities outside the home with peers, children of different ages, and adults. On the average, homeschooled students are involved in 5. 2 activities outside the home, with 98 percent engaged in two or more" (Romanowski, 2006). Another point is that public schools don't give the children all the experience for the life which is can make them deal with everything in his life and if we look at the reality they still children and their parents or their family member should help them in some problems that they cannot deal with it. According to Nelsen who argues that "home schooled children are more frequently exposed to a wider variety of people and situations than could be expected in a traditional classroom environment where their exposure is limited to twenty-five to thirty-five people of similar age and socioeconomic background" (1998, 35).
Also some people said that homeschooled adults are not a good citizen and the adults who study in public schools like are better than them because they are not involve in community as homeschooled when they are children. But "Home Schooling Grows Up," released by Dr. Brian Ray, argues that "home schooling produces successful adults who are actively involved in their communities and continue to value education for themselves and their children" (2003, p 6). Also Ray showed that:
Seventy-one percent of homeschool graduates participate in an ongoing community service activity, compared to 37 percent of U.S. adults of similar ages.
Eighty-eight percent of the homeschool graduates surveyed are members of an organization (such as a community group, church, or professional organization) compared to 50 percent of U.S. adults.
Homeschool graduates are more likely to contribute money to a political party and are more likely to work for a political party or cause.
Seventy-six percent of homeschool graduates surveyed between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four voted in a national or state election within the last five years, compared to only 29 percent of the relevant U.S. population.
Homeschool graduates are more likely to have participated in a protest or boycott, attended a public meeting, wrote, or telephoned a public official or signed a petition more often than the general population. (Ray 2003)
According to some people who asked, if the parent can find the good materials to teach their children. Lips and Feinberg (2008) note that, if the parent google for homeschooling they will find more than 13 million hits and they will find some companies that share resources such as Kumon and Sylvan Learning Centers who have developed parts of their businesses designed to support the parent who home-schools.
For that argument who said that homeschooled students will not perform will in their colleges and universities. Actually it not truth as I mention before about the nationwide study which showed that homeschooling will perform very well in their colleges and universities. And to be more specific homeschooling the study shows that homeschooling adults had achieved more higher education level compared to others.
Finally, a lot of studies show that children and the people who had homeschooling are not different and sometimes they are better than the others and this performance comes from a lot of advantages of homeschooling such as one-on-one learning, engaging in distance learning, the variety of the materials, and the flexibility of homeschooling. And these things can improve them in all aspects of life like academic performance and socialization. In conclusion, people should stop the debate that public schools are better than homeschooling because a lot of researches and studies show that homeschooling is the best way to teach our children.
