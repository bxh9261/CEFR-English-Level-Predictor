In 2005, the worldwide motion picture industry lost more than $7 billion as a result of Internet piracy. Or at least that's what they want you to think. The MPAA and RIAA have always scapegoated piracy as the reason for everything bad that has ever happened to the entertainment industry. It's not surprising that the MPAA decided to keep the details of the report hidden from public eyes. After all, all that they're interested in is having big numbers for headlines. Yet, no matter what they do and how hard they try, piracy has always and will always be running strong. There's a simple reason for this. People get from piracy what they can't from normal methods of distribution - speed, reliability, variety and convenience. Instead of attacking piracy, industries and organizations like the MPAA/RIAA should accept piracy for what it is. They fail to see its beneficial effects on the economy. Not only has piracy and pirates had a positive net effect on the economy, but piracy also acts as a guide for the entertainment industry to follow. Piracy is not a bad thing; it is in fact one the best things to happen to modern entertainment.
