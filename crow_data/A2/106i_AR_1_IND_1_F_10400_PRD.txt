Is it healthier to skip a meal or eat junk food? 
Over the course of this research question I was able to gather enough research and data to come up with an argumentative question to discuss. That is, that you must not skip a meal, even if it means you have to eat junk food. The reason I chose this motion is because with the evidence I have collected and discussed in the previous papers tend to support the idea that not eating at all can have a worse impact on the body and how it causes us to react than eating unhealthy for one meal. 
This topic is important as it relates to adolescents specifically around the world and more importantly, it relates to me and gives me a better insight to eating healthier for my benefit. I chose this topic because as I have progressed throughout my freshman year, I have begun to eat less or eat unhealthier which has caused drastic changes in my health and in the way I behave and react. Previously I used to be alert and assertive at all times as I had a stable healthy meal with all my necessary nutrients, whereas as the year has gone by I have begun to eat less and at unsuitable times which has affected me negatively. As I started researching this topic I was able to find many scientific articles and other published material on how, not eating a proper meal can affect our body. The motion I would like to support in my paper using scientific research and an interview is that it is better to eat unhealthy food, rather than skip a meal.
