Final Paper 
Is it healthier to skip a meal or eat junk food? 
The topic I have chosen is important to everyone of all ages but mainly relates to adolescents and primarily those in college, as students tend to miss meals the most frequently when they do not have enough time between their scheduled classes or when they are unfortunately required to eat their meals at odd timings due to class conflicts. 
The argument I have chosen to present in this essay is that you must not skip a meal, even if it means you have to eat junk food. The reason I chose this motion is because with the evidence I have collected and discussed in the previous papers on whether it is better to eat junk food or skip a meal, all the information tends to support the idea that not eating at all can have a worse impact on the body and that it can cause us to react unconventionally, whereas eating unhealthy for a meal is safer. 
Healthy eating for everyone and is especially important to 'growing teens' around the world. It relates to me and other students in the same situation as me, which will in turn give me a better insight to eating healthier for my and other students benefit. Arguing in favor of eating unhealthy is better because as students progress throughout their freshman year, they have begun to eat less or eat unhealthier which causes drastic changes in health and in the way people behave and/or react. I would like to make this argument as, as the year has gone by, overall students have begun to eat less and at unsuitable times, which has negatively affected them. I believe that making this argument is important, as it will make students more aware of their health and ways to improve on their diet.
