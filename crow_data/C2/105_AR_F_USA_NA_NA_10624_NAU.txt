Hospice Care: The Best Solution for Dying Patients

Self Evaluation
I think that I wrote a successful paper. The reason I say this is because I accomplished everything that I wanted to and I covered all of the points I wanted to and I think that I explained them thoroughly. I am glad that I had to use two visuals because I really think that they strengthened the arguments in my paper. I think that the paragraphs have effective transitions in between them and they flowed well together. Overall I think it was a great success and I am proud of the final product because a lot of work went into it.
