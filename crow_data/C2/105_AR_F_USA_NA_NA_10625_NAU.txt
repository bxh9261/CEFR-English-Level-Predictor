Self-Evaluation
I thought that this paper went very well. I was able to research a topic I was interested in. I learned a lot about how complicated different issues can be. It is hard to find a clear-cut solution to a problem like global warming, but by having a paradigm shift in my thinking, I was able to see a solution to the problem that is not very commonly considered. The paper itself came out to be about the length that I planned it to be, and the use of separate sections helped to make the paper have a more logical layout. Also, I was able to find useful visuals that strengthened my paper.
