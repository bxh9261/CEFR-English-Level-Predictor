I was excited for this writing assignment because it allowed me to research something that has been occurring for quite some time and has been a big issue to not only Mexico, but U.S.A.'s as well. The length requirement did not drive my writing, but if anything it was the details of the subject that motivated me. I tried to use some documents from Congress and tried to use methods to confirm if the data was accurate or not. I think maybe more quotes from actual civilians on how they felt on the issue, if they approved of troops going to Mexico or not. Incorporating details of information that seems to me is wrong is a little interesting, but its true research and all sides need to be stated. Mainly I chose this topic because I wanted to research what the United States was thinking of doing about it.
