	There has been much debate recently about the usage of artificial uterus. It is a theoretical device that would allow for extracorporeal pregnancy or extra uterine fetal incubation by growing an embryo or fetus outside of the body of a female organism that would normally internally carry the embryo or fetus to term. Some see it positively because it reduces the pain when giving birth and the death rate of pregnant woman, and gives hope to the sterile. Others see the artificial uterus as a negative way that could actually violate the nature. They insist that it could lead to abuse such as military training or black-market organ sales. Thus, a balance should be made between the importance of one's life and the nature. I propose this solution: The government should make a restriction on who could use the artificial uterus under these three conditions: 1) only women are allowed; 2) the artificial uterus is only allowed to those who are officially diagnosed as sterile; 3) if one has already received the uterus, she is not permitted to use it again. 
CONCLUSION: As our technology and science develop as time passes by, the society is rapidly changing as well.
