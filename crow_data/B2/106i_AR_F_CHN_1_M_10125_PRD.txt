Time management skills for college students 
"Doing more with less" means doing more work in less time. Apparently, if college students have a good skill of time management, they will achieve college success more easily. Procrastination and absence in turning in assignments are the consequences of bad time management. I believe that time management helps students be more effective and stay on top of their study to get higher grades. Students should learn more about time management in colleges and universities and universities should also teach students about time management skills. 
One main reason is that time management skills can help students organize their time and tasks. Priority is the first step students need to consider when they manage their time. Comparing precedence of all tasks they have in a limited time, students need to finish the task with the highest priority first. Sometime students think that they have seemingly finished lots of "important" works, but after checking the schedule, they find out that important works are not done yet. Therefore, when students have lots of works, precedence is the most important factor in time management. In the article, "The Study Efficacy of Time Management Training on Increase Academic Time Management of Students"1, authors conclude that time management skills influence students' grades more potentially, implying that students need to insist on time management as a long term planning. Students need to consider their situation and make different plans, such as: study plan for dead week, daily and weekly plan and so on. According to authors, planning themselves should be as clear and simple as possible, whereas students need time to maintain their manage tools. According to all authors, Karim Babayi Nadinloyi2, Bruce K. Britton3, and Robert L. Dipboye4 and my interviewee, Ms. Vicki L. Gilbert Gilbert, academic adviser in Purdue university, it is important for students to recognize their own study-cycle. For example, students need to find out when they have highest productivity and then place some difficult works on that period. They need to reorganize schedule based on this cycle, or in another word "rhythm". Relaxing time is also a fundamental part in time management. Time management does not means students have to keep studying all the time, an appropriate amount of leisure time is needed in student's time management. 
Another reason is that time management can reduce the possibility of losing points due to accident. For example, a printed paper is due tomorrow. Unfortunately, printers are all broken so that the student can not find anywhere to print his work. As the result, he loses some points of this assignment. However, what if the student planned time early? The answer is obvious that the student will not lose points due to printing. Good time management is a good way to remind students about deadlines. Setting goals and inspirations can help students develop their time management more easily. 
Some may argue that although students manage their time, they do not have high efficiency during some period. For example, when feeling over fatigue, students can not do things in their schedule under the maximum efficiency. I understand the situation because I also met this before. Flexibility is one of basic factors of a good time planning. Schedule is not a list of mandatory tasks. It is important for students to change their schedules according to situations they are in. Students also need to find their own rhythm, as I mentioned before. It is effective to put important and burdensome works when students have high efficiency and concentration. Others may also argue that time management is not as easy as I mentioned. I accept their points of view, but I believe that through long time practicing, time management can become easier for students. As I mentioned, good time management skills can be trained. At first, it may seem difficult for students to plan their time. However, after attempting to use different skills and learning from others, they can be experts in time management. Through practice, they can find their study cycle and then make the most suitable plan for themselves. At last, they will enjoy in planning their time and getting succeed in grades. 
In conclusion, good time management is helpful for students with their life in college when they find their own suitable skills. Students should learn about time management skills because those skills are useful in almost every part of college life. Colleges and universities can also start course to teach students about time management.
