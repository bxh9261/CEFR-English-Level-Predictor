Video games have more positive effects than negative effects 
Most reported effects of video games - particularly in the popular press - appear to centre upon the alleged negative consequences (Mark Griffiths). It is true that almost every people around us have bad impacts on video games when we talk about them. Since we were young, parents warm us to stay away from video games and focus more on academic study, and how video games may ruins our life. But the fact is that video games actually have more benefit than people thing, we are just be blinded by public reports. When video games are designed to solve certain problems or to acquire certain skill, they will appear to be considerable success. 
Healthy care is always a top concern for people around the world, meanwhile, video games have link themselves to this topic. In some cases, rehabilitation can be applied with the help of video games. In Mark Griffiths' paper, he shows us a case which video games were used as a treatment tool for patient. A 13 year old boy with Erb's palsy use electronic games to improve his arm control. The authors concluded that the game format capitalized on the child's motivation to succeed in the game and focused attention away from potential discomfort (Mark Griffiths). Another case is that a time travel adventure game format is used to promote adolescents' achieve self-efficacy in HIV or AIDS. This game provides information and opportunities to high-risk people, warm them about what will happen. Safety information was received by participants, and participants get to know their ability to negotiate and conquer HIV or AIDS with potential partner. 
Also, because good learning principles can be incorporated in games, that's what make games improve toward good ways. People are quite poor at understanding and remembering information they have received out of context or too long before they can make use of it [Barsalou 1999; Brown et al. 1989; Glenberg and Robertson 1999]. So in the game System Shock 2, designers put information typically found in manual throughout the game, player can acquire the right information. These information is attached to context and appear constantly when player move through the game, make sure player have a clear idea of how these idea can be applied to that world. Another example I can think of is a game call Minecraft. I have play this game for a long time, it is a really attractive game. Inside of game, player can what to build, how to build base on how they want to. Changing the single element inside of the game make each people's game unique to others. Furthermore, this game can promote player's creative thinking. Player will try to decorate their house in different styles, or defend themselves from dangers through multiples ways. This game make players producers instead of consumers. Too often, students in schools consume, but do not produce, knowledge, and rarely get to help design the curriculum [Brown 1994]. 
Other than entertainments, video games can also be use a research purpose, by using it as research tools. The reason why many people love video games is that they are attractive and full of fun. Some people believe they have the potential to be used as research value to approach learning. Some important skills maybe enforce by video games, like spatial visualization ability, eye-hand co-op, and tactical thinking. Video games can be used as research tool because they have great diversity. And also they are really attractive for people which make participants focus longer in the research than they used could be. Last, they are entertaining and stimulating for participants. 
Although video games have such useful quality, but they can still cause addictive and make player lose self control. One of my participants <Name> indicated that she will invest lots of money to her games. She will use the money to upgrade her items and each cost 20 to 30 dollars, the sum of that is considerable large. For a person who does not have a stable income, this is a behavior of losing self-control and addictive to games. 
Even most people assume video games have more negative effects on people. But the fact is, video games have more potential benefits than we think. We should widely use their good to overcome what bad they have on us.
