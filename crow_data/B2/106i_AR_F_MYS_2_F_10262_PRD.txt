Antidepressant Drugs: Good or Bad?

Introduction 
According to Dr. <Name>, a general practitioner in Malaysia, depression is a medical disorder in which "a persistent low mood and aversion to activity affects a person's thoughts, behaviors and well-being" (personal communication, 2015). The most common treatment for depression is antidepressants. However, until today, it is still controversial whether antidepressant drugs are safe or effective. Although people say that antidepressants have many negative side effects and should not be used, I still think that antidepressants are necessary as a complement to therapy, and they can be safe to use as long as the correct prescriptions are taken. 
Body 
I used to have depression and at the same time I have met people who have been diagnosed with depression. Due to this I feel it is very important to find a proper treatment for depression because for one who has gone through the darkest chapter of her life, it can be said, literally, that depression is not something to joke about, as said by Elizabeth Wurtzel, "That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to ever see the end. The fog is like a cage without a key." For the sake of this paper, I have done research regarding depression and its treatments by doing an interview with a general practitioner, Dr. <Name> and reviewing academic journals regarding depression and antidepressants. My research questions are as follows: 
1. Are antidepressants safe to use? 
2. Are antidepressants effective? 
I will use the knowledge that I have gained to persuade people to understand the importance of antidepressants. 
Antidepressants (ADs) are not a happy pill or are they a panacea (remedy for all difficulties). ADs are prescription-only drugs that come with risks as well as benefits, and should only be taken under a doctor's supervision (John Hauser, 2013). The effectiveness of antidepressants depends on the severity of the depression. Psychiatrist, Petros Markou, M.D., said that for adults with severe depression, "there is strong evidence that antidepressants are more effective than any other treatment." However, for a mild depression, antidepressants are no better than a placebo (Fava, 2014) - a harmless pill prescribed for the psychological benefit. Critics would say that psychotherapy is more effective than antidepressants, but psychotherapy together with antidepressants are far more efficacious. Based on my interview with Dr. Zaahirah, she said that antidepressants alone are insufficient and that support from family and friends is also important in order for a patient to recover fully. Kelsberg and Trotter also did a review of 13 controlled clinical trials for patients with generalized anxiety disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy together with antidepressants (Kelsberg & Trotter, 2007). The review supported my previous statement in which going through therapy and taking antidepressants together is far more effective. Therefore, all of this evidence strengthens the fact that antidepressants as a complement to psychotherapy are more effective and advantageous. 
Most people are concerned about the harmful side effects of antidepressants. However, all medications have aftereffects if not taken as prescribed, but the SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) such as Prozac, Celexa and Zoloft, are said to have fewer side effects compared to other type of ADs (Ferguson, 2001). Although some people argue that SSRI's also cause side effects such as sexual dysfunction and insomnia, there are a lot of ways that researchers devised to avoid those side effects such as reduce dosage and meet a therapist (Komaroff, 2015). In addition, Lapi et al reviewed a large sample of data from the United Kingdom Critical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and it is shown that antidepressants do not associate with increased risk of c AF (Lapi, 2015). In contrast, a millionaire philanthropist, Sir Peter Lampl who had depression was claimed to have an immediate personality changes after consuming the antidepressants he was prescribed with. To refute this argument, Psychiatrist Dr William Shanahan, medical director at Capio Nightingale Hospital, London, is insistent that anti-depressants are safe. Shanahan mentioned that Peter Stampl's case is very unusual and difficult to explain without a full pharmaceutical history. He added that such an extreme reaction would probably be caused by external factors such as a build-up of medication, linked with another illness, stress or alcohol consumption. All in all, critics said that antidepressants should not be used in treating major depression because they have a lot of negative side effects. However, this argument are clearly flawed. 
Conclusion 
As a conclusion, I would like to underline that antidepressants are important in the treatment of depression. As much as they are said to be ineffective, antidepressants do make a significant changes when combined with therapy. At the same time, the statement of which antidepressants have negative side effects is inapplicable as all medications have side effects if it is not prescribed accordingly. However, I still want to highlight that AD is not an elixir and it would not work its 'magic' in treating depression without external supports. Taking medications is also not a sign of weakness, but rather, a sign of courage within imperfection. Therefore, the next time we encounter someone who has depression; remember that "There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds." (Laurell K. Hamilton).
