The Best Way To Control Feral Cat Problem 
	Feral cat population problem is a serious problem. Feral cats not only hunt other species that causing ecosystem unbalanced, but also spread disease that can even influence human health. In order to solve feral cat issue to protect other endanger animals and human lives, couples of solutions have been considered: TNR program, TVHR program and killing method. Although killing method is the fastest and most efficient way to deal with this problem, considering the both efficiency and humanity, TVHR should be carried out rather than killing method. 
	For a long period, Trap, Neuter and Return, also called TNR program has been used to control feral cat number as a human way. How ever, through out computer model, TNR will work only if over 57% feral cats are involved in TNR program, which is almost impossible because feral cats have a very large population in one colony. According to SPCA studies, the number of feral cats in the U.S is estimated to be in the tens of millions, and that is why TNR could not really work in long term. 
	Due to the ineffective TNR program, there is another point of view that suggests killing the feral cats instead of neutering them. Although killing method do have strong power reducing feral cat number, this method is strongly objected by animal lovers who believe that it is so cruel and inhuman to other creature. Since the source of feral cat issue is people's abandonment of unaltered cats, how can we make up our own fault by massacring innocent creature? Therefore, in order to make ends meet both effect and humanity, TVHR is the best way to control feral cat problem.
