Chinese students' communication problem in United State 
Nowadays, a large proportion of Chinese international students In USA have communication problems. They can't communicate well with local Americans or other western cultural students. As a result of this communication problem, most students choose to stay with other Chinese fellows and limited their contact with other international and American students. It is very necessary to improve this situation, and I suggest every Chinese student to contribute to develop a better communication environment. 
Some Chinese students may wonder: "Why it is necessary for us to communicate with Americans? We are satisfied with staying with other Chinese students, and can get almost all the assistance from our fellows." This is a good point, and it is reasonable. But, I still believe that we can get better experience and self-develop by interacting and communicating with Americans. Personally, I have learned many things from other American students. One thing especially impressed me is their independence. In China, I thought that I would be independent as long as I left my parents. But other American students' stories have taught me that being independent is more than just living by myself. Rather than taking money from our parents, most American students choose to take part-time jobs, to apply many scholarships or to sign up contract with military. My resident assistant Eric is a pilot. Due to the high tuition fee on his major, he have applied several scholarships to reduce the burden of his parents. In China, taking care of parents is a virtue. Maybe, we should learn how to be independence first to relieve our parents. 
Some Chinese students may consider: "Improving the communication environment is universities' duties, not ours." I admit that universities' support is beneficial, but the key of the communication is still ourselves. I agree with Dr. <name>'s, an educational psychology professor in Purdue University, opinion that communication is a mutual thing, which depends on the communication ability and willingness from both sides. As what he said: "Even the language ability is the key of one conversation, but I believe that there is another important factor that could potentially prevent Chinese students to communicate, which is self-efficacy. I have seen that many Chinese students view themselves as lacking of talent in learning English. This feeling will discourage them and eventually stop them to communicate." I think it is solid truth. I was in an international social program before. Even though this program gave me plenty of opportunities to communicate, but I quit later because I felt I was not ready yet. I thought I couldn't found proper topic to talk with American students, and I was afraid of others joking on my terrible pronunciation. That feeling kept me from communicating with other international students. Fortunately, encouraged by my parents, I kept talking to American students and professors for a short time every day, and I gradually could pronounce correctly and found the common things we shared in the conversation. This kind of collective communication also give me the confidence to communicate. 
In conclusion, even thought, most of today's Chinese students still have communication problem with American and other international students, but I encourage my same race to be brave to communicate, and I hope our efforts can motivate more and more other Chinese students to establish better relationship with American students. As I said: "It is very necessary to improve this situation, and I suggest every Chinese students to contribute to develop a better communication environment."
