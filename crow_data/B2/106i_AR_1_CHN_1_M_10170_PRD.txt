Pay attention to the driving difference between America and China 
My father was an engineer when I was a child, and he always brought some models of different cars to me. These models developed my interested in car in my childhood. When I was 18 years old, I went to get the driving license as soon as possible. I drove in China for almost a year, and China's traffic is crowed and heavy. After I graduated from high school; I decided to study at Purdue, and I heard about the highly developing of U.S traffic system. I felt excited to drive in America. When I first drove in U.S; I made some serious mistakes such as I did not stop behind the school bus when the students were crossing the road; I also changed the rules in the no passing zone in Chicago. These illegal actions make me start to think about the driving difference between America and China. I conducted an interview to the professor Chen who is the expert in driving and I also read several articles about driving difference between two countries. After these researches, I found out that it is very important for us to pay attention to these differences when we drove in America. 
I interviewed professor Chen. We talked about the reasons to pay attention on different driving experience in America. He thought the different regulatory system existed between America and China can the main reason. The agency named "BMV" conducted the theory test for drivers, and this agency is independent with police system. The police can try their best to find out the weakness in the theory test; however the police system both conducts the theory tests and regulation in China, and it is hard for them to find the mistakes, which exist in their own system. To find more information about this topic, I read the article, which talks about the drivers' behaviors in Beijing. The authors think with the increase of the population of cars in Beijing, the driving schools want more profit, as the result the only thing they want to do is making the students pass the drive exam. They taught them something only for the exam not for daily driving. Even Chinese drivers can past the exam, but when they face the burst situation; they cannot mange them appropriately. (2009, Aberrant driving behaviors: A study of drivers in Beijing). I think we should pay more attention on the theory test in America and understand every single role of the laws to make sure we can drive safety in America. For example, the America traffic law states that the vehicles should stop when the students are getting off or getting on. If the Chinese students do not remember this rule, they will violate the law when they face the school bus. This action could be charged as dangerous driving, and the consequence of this is serious. University might kick out the students. 
To find more information about driving difference between two countries, I found the article named "Experiences from dual-country drivers: Driving safely in China and the US", the authors focus on the reasons for these differences. China has much more cars in roads, and drivers need to compete the same path with other vehicles and pedestrians. (2005,Experiences from dual-country drivers: Driving safely in China and the US). From my observation, the China roads are becoming much more heavier than before. Compare to China, American can feel more free to driver in America roads and it makes sure that no one want to compete the paths with other drivers. The article also mentioned that the American drivers are more familiar with cars than Chinese, because most American families owned at least one car. The teenagers can touch the cars when they are young, and when they pass the driving exam and start to driver; their parents can help them to adapt driving. However, most Chines drivers are the first generation drivers, it is hard for them to convert bicycle to cars. They might bring some bad habits to their daily driving.( 2009,Aberrant driving behaviors: A study of drivers in Beijing ). I think Chinese drivers are still feeling strange to the cars, and they need time to develop the understanding to car driving. For example, some Chinese drivers think they can violate laws if they think the laws are not reasonable, this ideal also the main reason for the most serious accidents. 
Finally, I think there is a big difference in daily driving between America and China. Chinese still need learn a lot from American. The different road environments and driving habits will cause the huge difference in driving experience. However, it is very important to pay attention on these differences to keep safety.
