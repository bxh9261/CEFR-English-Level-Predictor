Phubbing 
Have you ever seen these scenes? At bus station, many young people lower their heads and concentrate on their smart phones when they are waiting for the bus; at friend's party, your old friends prefer to type on their phones rather than talk to others near them. Are you annoying with such of these things or are you one of the people doing the same things? This phenomenon which has appeared in recent years is called Phubbing. The new word, Phubbing, is an amalgam of the words "phone" and "snubbing", which means people snub someone in favor of mobile phones, and it has become a common phenomenon in modern society. It may be true that the smart phones provide great convenience for modern people; however, because of the rapid update of the phones and the burst of the social network, more and more people, including adolescents and elders, are addicted to the smart phones and lack of the real world communication. Based on my research, Phubbing brings negative effects to people and society, although it is hard to stop Phubbing completely, people's self-control and the device technical change may relieve this social problem.

Reasonable: 1) pace of life is rapid people just have fragment time to connect with others on the phone 
2) phone is necessary for modern people always check phones to not miss important information 
In opposite: 1) just want to perform "self" to win influence in the virtual world superficial, emotionally lazy relationship people actually feel lonelier and more overwhelming 
. Negative effects brought by Phubbing 
. Hard to stop 
Can be broken with a little effort 
. Other than people's effort technical solution to relieve Phubbing new application encourage people to engage in face to face interaction.
