Homesickness isn't a kind of illness 
Is homesickness a kind of illness like a mental disease? It is true that most of people who leave their home because of working or studying may feel homesick. Due to unfamiliar environment, people may miss their home, their parents or even their favorite food. If the homesickness were heavy, they would lose weight, fail exam or give up working or studying abroad.

It is not a kind of illness but a special emotion.
