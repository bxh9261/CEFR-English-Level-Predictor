As the days goes by ISIS grows stronger exponentially. This notorious radical army led by a delusional people, who convinced helpless young men into joining their cause. ISIS says that they are doing what Allah's has asked them to do, but is killing children, women, and other helpless people is what Allah has asked to do? Can they justify the mass killings by this excuse? ISIS is a growing concern, and people from all over the world are wondering what should be done to stop ISIS. Some of them say that we must stop them right now before they get out of control, and start a Third world war. Others say that we should wait and see what happens after the liberate Syria because if we interfere now the Syrian people might get caught in the line of fire. I have found a better solution than both of these ideas, which is doing both of these ideas. We must fight them beck in the areas that does not belong to Syria, like in Iraq. If there are not expanding their land into Iraq then they will get frustrated and they will start looking for hope in another place such as Syria. This move will ensure the safety of the Iraqi people and the liberation of Syria. When they move their operations into Syria, then we leave them to be. After they liberate Syria we can move in and annihilate ISIS once and for all. In Addition, we can limit their power by cutting off their sources of income, such as: the crude oil they sell, private funders from all over the world, looting banks, and extortion. Handling their source of income is the best way to approach this problem because it is not going into war against them, but at the same time we are trying to stop them from moving forward.

	We should stop ISIS right now because of we don't then they will become unstoppable without a full-on war against them. If we don't, then think about the amount of blood that will be spilled, women that will become sex slaves, and children who will become slaves and workers for them. That is the cost of leaving ISIS without trying to stop them. 
	However, we should also consider Syria. Right now no one is trying to help Syria with their civil war. It has been almost 3 years now, and nothing is going to stop al-Assad's regime except ISIS. ISIS has taken over almost half of Syria, but they stopped their advance into Syria because they know that no one will help the Syrian people except them, so they focused on their operations in Iraq to make the whole world hands tied and forcing them to do one thing which is doing nothing. Because if they succeed in stopping ISIS then the hope for the Syrian people is lost. 
---------------------------------------------------- Conclusion ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
	We can stop ISIS if we can make the smart choices. If we take my approach to stopping them it might take a while, but it has a positive and a sure outcome. We can help end the Syrian civil war, and we can help the world be annihilating ISIS.
