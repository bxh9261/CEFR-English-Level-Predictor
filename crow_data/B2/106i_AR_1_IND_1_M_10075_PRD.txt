Black Hole at the Center of our the Milky Way and its Role in our Galaxy Formation 
Introduction 
The universe in which we reside continues to surprise us. As we improve our technological abilities and develop better tools for exploration, we are learning more about how the universe began and all the phenomena that surround us. One such phenomenon happens to be right in our backyard, a supermassive black hole (also called Sgr A*) located at the center of our galaxy. Supermassive black holes are usually highly active and take in matter at a very quick rate, which has been observed in case of several active supermassive black holes. Hence some people claim that the same may be the case with our galaxy and that we may end up as dinner for the black hole. This, however, is not true because of three reasons. Sgr A* is extremely inactive, it belongs to the RIAF model of black holes and from observation we know that the Milky Way galaxy is in a stable state and is not collapsing. Due to these three reasons it is safe to say that we will not end up as dinner for the black hole in the near future. 
Reasons 
Firstly, it is important to recognize the fact that Sgr A* is a supermassive black hole in a near-dormant state. It hardly ever takes in any matter and just acts like a celestial body with gravitational force. 
Moreover, Sgr A* is of the Radially Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) model. Thus a major part of the matter that enters the accretion disk of the black hole eventually never falls into the black hole, rather gets ejected out as energy. 
Finally, detailed study show that our galaxy is highly active but stable. The black hole plays a role in this stable state by holding together the matter in our galaxy. It is highly unlikely that the black hole will destabilize that galaxy or that we will spiral down into the black hole.
