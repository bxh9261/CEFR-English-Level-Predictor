Apple never disappoint us 
"Macbook is garbage! You should change your laptop." It was what my friend who loved electronic configuration very much told me before. I was really confused that time about why so many people hate Apple so much. And the so called "the most successful smartphone" i Phone is mocked by others about some poor details inside or outside i Phone. Nowadays Apple company's product spread to the whole world. Teenagers, adults, kids even old men use Apple's products like i Phone or i Pod. It's not a strange thing now to see almost every one is looking at his or her i Phone without talking to each other in the subways and buses. Apple company changed people's life style. They made the progress and advancement of human's communication. We use i Phone to wake us up in the morning instead of using alarm clock. We use i Pad to watch movie and TV program instead of watching them in the the theater or on TV. We even abandoned our computer and work with i Pad every day. All these things prove Apple's success. But nowadays, so many drawbacks appear in Apple's products. And it makes many people, not exactly experts, suspect Apple company. They think Apple is using negative ways to be successful. They doubt Apple's best creation as plagiarize ideas from earlier successful products. Parents thinks Apple creating powerful function gradually ruins their children's grades. And even some medias exposure that Apple was hiring Hackers to their company. Well, The opinions are just opinions. The truth should based on evidence. I would tell the people who suspect Apple company that Apple never disappointed us and they were not using any negative ways to be successful.
