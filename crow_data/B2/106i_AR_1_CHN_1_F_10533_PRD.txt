Safety and Security in Urban Space 
According to Maslow's hierarchy needs, safety is the second need after physical need. With rapid development, people start gathering to cities, where have tons of opportunities, and . Urban space is public area in cities and everyone can enjoy them. We should pay attention to the difference of safety and security. The safety of a place is inherent in its design. As suppose to security, which is others going to be able to hurt you in space. It may sound plausible that because urban space is public and open, people do not need to pay attention to it. In fact, bad things occur in urban space: children often fall down on stairs; disabled people with wheelchairs can not squeeze into a small elevator; gangsters threaten people in parks. From my perspective, people should put emphasis on safety in urban space. My statement will be further illustrated by three aspects: the relationship between green space and feelings of social safety, exclusionary space for disabled people, outdoor play space design for children. 
Some people may think, a space with many trees may have dangerous animal or people hidden in it. However, Contrary to theirs expectations, women and elder people with more green space feel safer. Also, in this case, it is the urban area we are talking about, so it is not necessary to worry about the dangerous animal. Usually people feel relaxer when surrounding by nature environment, and not trend to implement crimes. Additionally, according to the study done in Chicago and St. Louis, urban space without green space causes more significant crime than the one with green space. If green space is able to decrease crime rate, then we can say it is making people feel more security . 
Some people may think it is unnecessary to build disabled facilities or think it is a waste of space and money. However, it is our duty to give respect and convenience to disabled people. We should consider their safety as the same time when we consider normal people's safety. Also, it may take more time to make a safer place for disability. For example, If one can not grasp, in the way that strong enough, he or she can not use gates or handles, handrails, and drinking fountain. In that instance, it has more to do with barrier free access to people of all abilities. Also, if we are building the public security report system, we need to consider if it is possible to a person with wheelchair to reach the emergency button. Therefore, we not only need to consider the safety and security of normal people, but also need to spend more energy on how to make it a safety and security apace for disabled people. 
Some people may think we already done a great job on children. However, there are still children get hurt in the play space, maybe just cut their finger or even lost their lives, so there are still many ways we can do better. Children should play for now, not just part of process of becoming an adult; being a child, not just the biological determination of becoming an adult, and disability as a social not a medical model. We also need to build a safer and more secure place for children. Also we need to be careful about the safety of children, since they may not know or may not be able to protect their self when facing dangerous, so it is more necessary to improve the security facility for children's space, like more safety camera and emergency button that a child can easily reach. 
If we consider the last two point together, we have a new topic "disabled children". People may think it is only their parent's' job to take their own children. However, it is not true, it is the responsibility to make this world a safer place for all the children in our society. According to a research about "exclusionary space (Carmona 20)". There are two kinds of barrier of design outdoor play space. One of the barrier of understanding disabled children is lack of involving disabled children and adults in the design process. In other words, they do not know how to design for disabled children, or even for any children (Woolley 1). The other barrier is that some knowledge of designing for disabled children has not been discovered. When we consider about the design for disabled children, we must be more carefully, because they are weaker and we also don't want them to find they are different from others and feel sad about that. 
When we design an urban space or build a public area. Safety and security are always the first two things we need to consider. They directly relate to our health and life. With the shortage of any of these two, no matter how beautiful this place is how much money was spended, the facility will be abandoned at last, because no one want to put their health and life in danger. It is our duty to make our city a safer and more secure place.
