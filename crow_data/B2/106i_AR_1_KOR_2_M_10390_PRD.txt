In March 2009, Obama lauded for Korean educational system and Korean parents for their zeal and passion. "That calendar may have once made sense, but today, it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea. That is no way to prepare them for a 21st-century economy." (President, 2009) As he mentioned Korean students do not have any memorable moments in their childhood but studying through nights and nights for the exam in order to achieve a dream of getting into top universities. Because a competition for going into the prestigious college is so fierce, private tutors and private institutions became prevalent and the value of public school dropped. Trends of getting these supplemental educations leave bulk of stress and pressure on students. Korean society and educational system have to transform in a way that students get primary education from their school to eradicate unfairness, extra costs, and stress. 
The tutors and cram schools have been around for very long time in Korea. Since the Choson Dynasty (1392-1910), passing the civil service exam administered by the royal court was seen as bringing social and material success for the entire family. Due to their zeal and passion, South Korea has transformed into the world's 13th largest economy; GDP has gone up about 40,000% since 1962 (Ripley, 2011). The mindset of bringing social and material success is still ongoing. Nowadays Korean students spent their youths to get into prestigious universities where admission slots are too few compared to the number of applications. Thus, most Koreans have to get supplemental classes from tutors and cram schools to outcompete their fellow-classmates. 
Some people might argue that if studying hard in cram schools and tutors can bring goods to students, how they can be the problem. The cram schools and tutors are problem because they give so much pressure and stress to students. In 2010, among South Koreans who confessed to feeling suicidal, 53 percent blamed academic performance and educational stress for the suicidal thoughts (Koo, 2014). The average high school student sleeps about 5. 5 hours a day, because they return home from the tutor and cram school past midnight (Koo, 2014). Because they don't get enough sleeps when they should have, students decide to sleep in their regular school hours; "When I visited some schools, I saw classrooms in which a third of the students slept while the teacher continued lecturing." (Ripley, 2011) It is very ironic and problematic that students are learning from outside of school and not learning from the public school where they should have. 
The prevalence of tutors and cram schools cause unfairness among students and also big pressure on their families. In 2012, Korean parents spent more than $17 billion on the cram schools and tutors (Ripley, 2013). As early as pre-school, it became common going to tutors and cram schools. In 2010, 74% of students are involved with going to at least one cram school (Ripley, 2011). Because high number of students gets help these institutions, those who cannot afford those private institutions would unfortunately fall behind than others; average cost of $2,600 per student for private after-school institution (Ripley, 2011). 41 percent of students living in Seoul who go to the most prestigious university in Korea, Seoul National University, came from the 3 richest districts in Seoul (Victoria, 2013). This statistic demonstrates that richer families get the better education and have more likelihood of going to universities like Seoul National University. 
There have been many attempts in order to fix the problematic education system. There were attempts to regulate and mandate the curfew of cram schools hours by 10p.m, but teachers and owners has broken the regulations by blacking out windows and operating in residential buildings. Even back in 1980s, the government banned cram schools to humanize the education system (Ripley, 2011). In order to fix the problem of dominance of cram schools and tutors, the value of public school have to be improved in a way that students do not feel necessary to go to private tutoring industry to learn the materials that will be on the exams. In order to raise the value of school, teachers should be examined every year and compete among themselves for their job; if one is not competent among other teachers, one should be required to get additional training. With plans of completion by the 2015, Korean public school is changing in a way that helps students to engage with others and develop knowledge effectively (Victoria, 2013). Rather than simply memorizing the materials, future educational system gives opportunities to discuss and debate the materials with classmates. When above changes are made, Korean students can study efficiently and without unpleasantness. 
It is time for Korean education system to revolutionize and fix the problems. Korean students have suffered and studied through rigorous and inefficient education system for so long. When cram schools and tutors are eradicated in Korean societies and students study effectively and hard in the public school, students and parents won't feel the pressure and stress caused by these ridiculous institutions. Because I was part of this unfortunate system, I truly hope that imminent changes are upcoming to make the Korean society the better and smarter.
