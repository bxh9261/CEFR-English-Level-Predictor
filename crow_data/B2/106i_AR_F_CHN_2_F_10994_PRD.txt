Benefits of Online Shopping and Its Growing Popularity 
Online shopping is one of the fastest growing shopping trends in many parts of the world, with China being one of them. Its growth has been in terms of increasing popularity as more people are choosing to use this shopping method and others spend more money on their online shopping. Evidence of the increasing popularity of online shopping in China is shown by statistics from China Industrial Information 2015, that showed turnover of online shopping industry in the year 2014 of China was four trillion and this was the highest amount in the world p.1. Also, five years ago, Pekingese spent only 2 Yuan from the Internet for every 100 Yuan of consumption but currently the amount has increased to 16 Yuan Beijing Evening News, 2015. This growing trend has obviously come with some effects. Most of the effects are positive but there are some which are negative. Overall, benefits of online shopping have led to its growing popularity. 
To start with, one of the benefits of online shopping is that it brings convenience to shoppers Kornum, & Bjerre, 2005. In many activities of people, convenience matters a lot. This is mainly due to the natural human nature of wanting to do things through the easier option or the fact that there are so many activities to do and therefore choosing the easiest ways of doing them is the best idea. This could also be due to need to for example save on time or cost. Online shopping therefore becomes a really useful way of buying items since it offers the much needed convenience. Gong et al, 2013, P. 215 discusses this convenience of online shopping where they argue in their article that many Chinese people have come to realize that the internet provides a very convenient environment for shopping. Also, from my interview with my friend <name> , she considered convenience of online shopping as one of the most important things that drew her to try it. She said that with online shopping, she did not have to spend a lot of time going to do physical shopping in the city as she could do the shopping from the comfort of her home <name> , personal communication, March 23th, 2016. 
This convenience comes through a number of ways. For example, it reduces costs of travel to physical stores to buy the items from there and this too saves on time. This is because one will comfortably do their shopping from their house and wait for the items to be delivered at their doorstep Clemes et al., 2013, P 365. In regard saving of time, <name> also gave me an example of how after buying the mask for her father's respirator online, it was delivered much faster the following day but had they chosen to buy it from the city, it would have taken a few days to get it <name> personal communication, March 23th, 2016. Another way that convenience has been improved is that shoppers can access different online sellers of the same product at the same time and this gives them the ability to compare the different options still at the comfort of their homes before choosing which option suits them best depending on factors such as price, reviews of previous customers and so on. 
Moreover, online shopping helps people to start businesses. It has very low entry barriers such as little capital requirements and therefore anyone can start such a business easily. The businesses are of benefit to their immediate owners and also the general society as they create employment and therefore improving living conditions for many people. Under this point, there are already some of my friends who make a living from online selling and this gives them enough money to sustain their lives through school. Online shopping also helps other industries to develop. Courier services industry is one such industries that benefit from online shopping as the sellers normally use it to deliver the goods to the buyers. Insurance industry also grow as the shoppers buy insurance of their goods like <name> told me in the interview <name> , personal communication, March 23th, 2016. Growth and development of these industries help in creation of more jobs in the economy and therefore improving the living standards of people. 
What's more, the buyers are able to get a good bargain on products. In many cases, products on the online market are at lower prices from those in the physical stores. This is because the online sellers do not incur expenses such as rent for a business premises and other utility expenses. They therefore put lower prices for their products and shoppers can save on the costs. This is a really good benefit to buyers since many buyers consider price as one of the main factors before they settle for which items to buy. Good prices for the products therefore benefits them the shoppers who can now buy more products at the lower prices. 
Another benefit is that by online shopping offering goods at reduced prices to the buyers, this brings competition to the other sellers who operate physical stores such as supermarkets. This competition is healthy in any market as the sellers will be forced to improve the quality of their services or even reduce prices so that they can continue attracting shoppers. When the prices are reduced or the quality of service is improved, it is the consumers who benefit. 
However, there are a few shortcomings of online shopping. One of them is that at times, there is risk of items that get delivered failing to match the description sellers had given on the website. From the interview, <name> also stated that this is usually one of her fears of online shopping but she has managed to find ways of ensuring she buy items only from those online sellers who do not have complaints posted about them by other shoppers <name., personal communication, March 23th, 2016. Also, there could be additional charges the buyer could incur the sellers delivered items not fitting in the description of the buyer. The additional costs could be cost of sending the item back to seller and insurance costs which are not incurred when one buys from a physical location. 
In conclusion, it is evident that online shopping is of great benefit to people's everyday lives. This is terms of issues discussed above such as enhancing convenience of shopping, creating platform for many people to start businesses and also help to develop other related businesses which leads to creation of employment, improving of living standards and therefore improvement of the general welfare of the economy. Shoppers also benefit from buying goods at lower prices than in physical stores, increased competition for traditional sellers such as supermarkets who react by improving quality if their services or the prices. Due to these benefits, online shopping is therefore growing greatly in popularity as more and more people seek to benefit from it. As for the shortcomings, they are few and they can easily be avoided if people selected their sellers properly. This would ensure they only buy from sellers who guarantee the buyers that what they will deliver matches the descriptions given online and should it not match, they will compensate the buyer.
