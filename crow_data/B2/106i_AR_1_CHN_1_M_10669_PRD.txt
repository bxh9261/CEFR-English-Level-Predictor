Weight Loss, Scientific Facts, and Benefits 
In the modern world today, obesity is a very severe issue in the United States. Obesity rates have more than doubled in adults and children since the 1970's [1], and today, 34.9% of adults in the U.S. are overweight [2]. Coincidentally, in the past few decades, chronic diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, have become the biggest threats to human health. Some of the diseases have not been researched to show direct correlation with overweight and obesity, but some are a very clear positive correlation, such as type II Diabetes [3]. Although many people believe they are experiencing sub-health condition, because they feel occasional organ twist or headache, they simply choose to ignore the minor changes in statistics of their body, such as weight, blood sugar, and blood pressure. They believe they are still far away from diseases and refuse to change, which is resulted from the combination of huge working load and self-deception. On the other hand, overweight and obesity also adds negative psychological impact to people. Obese students may get bullied in their childhood and adolescent age [4], and this will destroy their confidence and psychological health [5][6]. Taking both physical and psychological negative effects resulted from overweight into consideration, there is no reason to delay the treatment to overweight and obesity, and the best solution is to get rid of the burden of additional fat - weight loss. 
Weight loss is not simple. There are countless stories of people giving up on the path of weight loss, for instance, the simple "I quit". There are so many reasons can cause "I quit", but there is only one path to reach the ultimate goal. Therefore, it needs an effective exercise plan, a supportive diet plan, and sufficient knowledge about everything in weight loss in addition to dedication and determination to succeed in weight loss. 
A scientific weight loss plan is the beginning toward success. The weight loss plan created by the National Health Service of UK recommends people to exercise for 150 min at minimum with calorie meter in each week, this will help people track their calorie intake and output to achieve better weight loss result [7]. Some social media networking tool adds competition in exercise, which will further stimulate the intuition to work out, but it needs rational judgement to prevent from over-exercising. Over exercising will result hormone distortion, excessive heart stress, and muscle loss. There is a very famous myth saying "short time aerobic exercise is meaningless to weight loss." [8] This statement is terribly wrong. Although one aerobic exercise for over 45 min is significantly effective in burning fat [5], exercise less than 45 min will still burn calories and prevent the accumulation of fat. Fragmented exercise as short as 10 min will add to a great result [8], but waste those time on bed would contribute to nothing. In addition, weight lifting is also a good way to lose weight. The main effect of weight lifting is to build muscle, meanwhile, more muscle consumes more calories in daily basis, which will help burn fat [8]. As the exercise plan goes, participants need to overcome excuses. As long as people stick with the original exercise plan, successful weight loss is not a mirage any more. 
Physical exercise is essential to weight loss, but without a scientific diet plan, it is not as effective as people would expect. Therefore, to maintain a good amount of healthy nutrition in diet and limit the calorie intake is also significant to the success of weight loss. The basic role in diet is to not over-eat. No matter how healthy and low calorie the diet plan is, more food means more calorie. However, it does not mean fad diet is good for weight loss either, because fad diet is to strict and depends solely on self-control [8]. Thus, it is necessary to have a diet plan that can satisfy appetite. A smart way to feed the appetite is to consume food containing more fiber, such as wholegrain food [7]. Fiber could stuff stomach for longer time and make people feel less hungry. In addition, many people may have wrong intuition to drinks. In fact, the calories contained in alcohol and or daily drink, such as coffee and juice, are very high at 7 calories per gram, which is almost as high as fat [7]. 
Although many variables are not controlled, such as weight loss method and distribution of fat reduction, weight loss as low as 5% is proved to reduce or eliminate obesity oriented disorders [6]. Weight loss between 10% to 20% will greatly improve glycemic control in type II diabetes subjects [6]. For three years, subjects who maintained weight loss for 5% above would have reduced plasma glucose. Research also found that weight loss has a linear relation with reduction of blood pressure [6]. In long term studies, weight loss is effective in slowing or preventing the return of hypertension. Weight loss will also contribute to reduction in LDL cholesterol [6]. Psychologically, women who lost weight at 17.3% average of initial weight have amelioration of symptom of binge eating behavior [6]. Effect of weight loss is also associated with fat distribution. Research points out that loss in visceral fat will increase HDL cholesterol level. Fat in upper body is more closely related to all cholesterol levels (total, HDL, LDL) than lower body fat [6]. Weight loss also have different effects for different ethnics. Study to women with 43-44% body fat shows that upper body fat has less detrimental effects to black women than white women in regarding to development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [6]. Lastly weight loss has different effects for people in different age groups [6]. Mode of weight loss have impact on people, for example rapid weight loss and repeated weight loss in cycle. However, this effect is not clear yet [6].
