Benefits of Living On Campus for Students 
Did you know that living in the dormitories for 4 years could increase your cumulative and semester grade point average by a letter grade while giving you the chance to meet a wide variety of people who are outside of your usual social scene? 
Multiple researches proved that the residence of students could change the way they get involved with their schools. Life in the university residence halls is more beneficial for students in terms of their academic and social life. 
From the early experience I had, I have always found living in the dormitories more beneficial when it comes to academics. Especially for the first year students who are required to take the general education classes, by living in the dormitories, they can find many people who are taking the same classes and assigned to do the same work. This similarity will naturally open up a collaborative working environment where students can share their knowledge, and work together without the additional assistance. Working together does not only help students to get their work done, but it also helps them to develop skills that will prepare them for the professional world.
