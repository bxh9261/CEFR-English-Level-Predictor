Argumentative Essay First Draft 
	Considering that eight out of ten most dangerous cities, the "fortresses of crime" in America (Stockton, Rockford, Oakland, Memphis, New Haven, St. Louis, Detroit and Flint) have unemployment rate above national average, unemployment indeed triggers social instability and people care about it. Attending the Industrial Roundtable career fair in Purdue University, I discovered the fact that the management major students who are going to work in service field will have less opportunity to be recruited, compared with students who can work on technology improvement such as programmer and electrical engineers. This sharp contrast reminded me that automation, which is promoted by engineers and replacing service employees, can lead to service unemployment. Unemployment of public service workers accounts for a large proportion of the unemployment; therefore, there are always debate on the damage that service automation brings to public service unemployment and whether this sort of unemployment can be revered. 
Admittedly, service automation may not be always giving rise to service unemployment. As the interviewee of my interview report, <name> stated, some benefits are brought to service workers by automation. At first, the labor intensity, the work that a labor is required to do per day, to some extent can be decreased by service automation. Some dirty and heavy work can be done by automation and some service employees can use instead of being replaced by the automation so they might feel the job easier. Another advantage which he mentioned was that automation will give birth to or give impetus to other service jobs to help more people being employed. Wilson told me an example that the shopping is being transferred to computer automation. Online shopping will definitely promote the development of another service job, express delivery and will popularize use of the computer. 
However, the decrement of labor intensity's coverage is limited. The service workers who are able to get use of the automation are only a small segment of the people who have the ability to work in service field. Since most of the jobs can be done by automation, for per five automated machine may be managed by only one service labor. It is only the employees who manipulate automated machine can enjoy the utility of declined labor. As for the other workers who should have been working with this employee but finally replaced by automation, they miserably lost their jobs. 
Some automation that completely replaces a job position cannot be ignored. For instance, self-driving cars are able to work without a bus driver. Compared with human drivers, these cars benefit people by reducing traffic accidents and congestion, helping increase the productivity in commuting time and saving energy. But the taxi, bus and delivery drivers pay for the convenience of the automated cars. Their working positions are taken by these merciless cars. It is not a scene in science fiction any more when you see fully automated cars speed by. On the street of Mountain View in California, self-driving cars produced by Google can be seen. Also, on highways you can see automated trucks and on farms you can see automated tractors. And as a journalist Vivek Wadhwa wrote: 
"Uber just hired away dozens of engineers from Carnegie Mellon University to build its own robotic cars. It will surely start replacing its human drivers as soon as its technology is ready -- later in this decade. As Uber CEO Travis Kalanick reportedly said in an interview, 'The reason Uber could be expensive is you're paying for the other dude in the car. When there is no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere is cheaper. Even on a road trip.'" (Wadhwa 8) 
There is no way to mention abating labor intensity when only a few people are employed. Thus, it is not accurate to generally claim that automation is conducive to reducing labor intensity due to the fact that the number of service workers whose jobs taken away by automation is much larger than the fortunate ones who are providing service with self-service machines. 
Despite the fact that thanks to automation some extra jobs need more employees, automation has destroyed more jobs than it creates. It is common that in some shopping malls such as Wal-Mart, consumers check out by using a self-service machine and only one sales clerk is needed for just looking after several counters. It is much more efficient than the traditional approach of checking out because customers do not have to wait in a long line. Some of the automation services and management are so "smart" that they can replace employees in service sectors which require routine and repetitive operations such as money counting, data entry, bill calculation and car driving. "In US, the rapid development of automation is removing a big piece of the approximately seven million business and financial operation jobs." (Nisen 6) The number of jobs damaged by automation obviously exceeds that of the jobs created by automation such as delivery. 
Some people, who do not believe that service automation harms employment in service field, proclaim that automation unemployment can be recovered by reasonably stating that "there is nothing to worry about because we will create new jobs just as we did in previous centuries when the economy transitioned from agrarian to industrial to knowledge-based". Individuals who have this notion are more likely to be technology elites who promote automation. According to Wadhwa's words: 
"Technology mogul Marc Andreessen has called the idea of a jobless future a 'Luddite fallacy,' referring to past fears that machines would take human jobs away. Those fears turned out to be unfounded because we created newer and better jobs and were much better off." (Whadhwa 19) 
After the Second Industrial Revolution, factories and machines are used, and the percentage of manual workers in the whole work force decreased with the increment of factory workers. That was a shift of production method. Labors who previously worked as craft workers began to manipulate machines and achieved desirable production efficiency. 
	Nevertheless, in the era nowadays, recovery of service unemployment is no longer possible and only buffering the shock of this unemployment can be accomplished. With the development of modern technology, the service automation has reached a level that can perfectly substitute some grey collars or even blue collars. It is not the same as service labors coherently working with self-service machines in a higher productivity, but it is a cruel killing of service employees done by automation. Now the production is transferring to a totally new era, different from shifting from agrarian to industrial. 
"And yet there are no signs of the trend reversing. Because technology is evolving faster than ever before with little to no oversight or regulation, the likelihood of more jobs being replaced by new tech is at an all-time high, Wallach told Business Insider." (Thompson 15) 
Automation has been frightening a large scale of service jobs, and many of these service labors are not capable of being retrained in a short period to be technology engineers, following the development trend. That is to say, putting all these service labors to newly created job is unpractical and a perfect recovery of service unemployment cannot be realized. As a result, it is extremely likely that a large number of service employees who are regretfully replaced by automation will be in unemployed status with no income. But fortunately, as Wilson pointed out, government can take actions to alleviate the sudden shock of service unemployment: 1) Decreasing interest rate. 2) Decreasing taxes. 3) Government Expenditure. 4) International Involvement. 
	To sum up from the research I have done, service automation would rather harm than assist service employment, given that the proportion of labors expelled because of the introduction of automation far exceeds the ones who staying in work place and working with automated machines. And since in the 21st century technology is getting too "smart", the crash of service unemployment cannot be cured by redistributing work force. Service labors are not ready for being trained as technology scientists yet. This fact implies a potentially jobless future instead of "Luddite fallacy", so government has the indispensable task to mitigate service unemployment strike and make a plan for the usage of service automation.
