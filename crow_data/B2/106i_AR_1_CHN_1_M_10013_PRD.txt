I have done long research on international students (IS) in internships. Internships do affect IS in different aspects, such as work experience, interaction with different people and adaptability in new environment. Overall, in my opinion, joining in an internship program in summer is beneficial to international students. 
First of all, internships give IS a unique work experience. The reason why IS study in a foreign country is to seek a competitive experience compare to other students. Internship properly meet their needs. This experience, not only help practice IS working ability, but also show company that they are competent on jobs. Data shows that students who are in interns have a higher chance to enroll in graduated school and get a full time job. 
Secondly, internships let IS practice their skill of interaction with different people. Through research, lots of IS have difficulty when communicate with native students or students from different countries. One main reason is the language barrier, and culture difference is another one. When IS work as a part of team in internships, they have to talk and show their opinion with others, which practice their communication ability. 
Last but not the least, internship provide a new environment to IS. Who participate in internships should adapt themselves in this new environment, so that they can work efficiently. Research shows that IS who have an internship experience can more easily fit in different work environment. 
Some students may have different opinion. Ones may state that internships avoid them go back to their hometown. Others may say that internships sometimes do not meet students' expectation. However, gaining such a precious experience is enough for students to make some sacrifice. For the second one, "No pain no gain", if ones never work in an internship, they will never know whether it will meet their expectation. Ones should at least try to work in an internship.
