Pay Attention: International Students Driving in America 
My father was an engineer when I was a child, and he always brought some models of different cars to me. These models developed my interest in cars in my childhood. When I was 18 years old, I went to get my driving license as early as possible. I drove in China for almost one year, and the traffic there is crowed and heavy. After I graduated from high school, I came to study at Purdue, and even before I came, I heard of the highly developed of U.S traffic system. I felt excited to drive in America. When I first drove in U.S, I made some serious mistakes such as not stopping behind the school bus when the students were crossing the road and changing lanes in the no passing zone in Chicago. These careless and illegal actions could make me in trouble according to American traffic laws. The different experience of driving in America makes me start to think about the differences in driving culture between America and China. I conducted an interview with professor Chen who is an expert in driving. I also read several articles about driving difference between these two countries. Based on what I found, I would like to argue that it is important for us to pay attention to these differences as international students driving in America, in order to make us drive safely. 
To find the importance of paying attention to the differences, first I thought we should find out the differences, which exist between two countries. During the interview with professor Chen, we talked about the reasons to pay attention to different driving experience in America. He thought the different regulatory systems existed between America and China can be the main reason. As we known, each driver needs to get the driving permit for half a year before they start to drive in Indiana. The agency named "Bureau motorcycle vehicle" conducted the theory test for drivers in America, and this agency is independent with police system. The police department charges to any violent actions for drivers to enforce the BMV revises the theory test; however the police system both conducts the theory tests and regulation in China. It is hard for an agency to find the weakness in its' system, and I think China government should make more effort on regulating the theory test. 
To find more information on the differences in regulatory system, I read one article that talks about drivers' behaviors in Beijing. The authors stated that the increase in the number of cars in Beijing motivated the driving schools' eager to make more profit, and as a result the only thing the schools want to do is making the students pass the driving exam. They taught them something only for the exam but not for daily driving. Although Chinese drivers can past the exam, when they face the burst situation, they cannot mange them appropriately. (2009, Aberrant driving behaviors: A study of drivers in Beijing). I think we should pay more attention on the theory test in America and understand every single role of the laws to make sure we can drive safety in America. For example, the America traffic law states that the vehicles should stop when the students are getting off or getting on. If the Chinese drivers do not remember this rule, they will violate the law when they face the school bus. This violation could be charged as dangerous driving, and the consequence of this is serious. University might kick out the driver. 
The officer's reaction to illegal actions is different between two countries. If you exceed the speed limit in China, and police office wants you to stop the car; you can try to let him know you did not see him then pass away. The police would not pay too much attention to you, and the police department will send a penalty fare to you. However, if the police officer wants you to pull over in America, then you would better to stop the car immediately then wait for his further instructions in the car. From my observation, American police officers will wait on the sides of the highway with the speed monitor. If they find you exceed speed limit, they will catch you up and use light to make you pull over. When international drivers face this situation, they should follow the officers' orders; park the car on the side of the way and wait in the car. Don't get out of the car, officers will consider you have attack intension, and they will take defense action to protect them. It is important to pay attention to this difference between two countries. You can get out of the car and argue with the police officer in China. If you are dear to argue with the officer, then you might be arrested. If you have any disagreement with officer, you can report to the police department instead of arguing with the officer. This regulation makes sure that officer has the completely authority at the scene. For example, several weeks ago, a Chinese student driver exceeded speed limit in California, and a police officer pulled him over. The student did not obey the officer's order, and tried to escape. As a result, six patrol cars and a helicopter were in the tracing. Finally Chinese student was charged as escaping and dangerous driving. If he followed the officer's order, he only needs to pay some forfeits. 
Ignoring these differences in driving between these two countries will cause serious consequences just like the Chinese student I mentioned before. The expected reaction to the police officer or to the pedestrians in the U.S. is different from China, and these differences are only a part of the whole system. Learning theory precisely and paying more attention to daily driving are the ways to avoid these potential threats.
