Can dynamic earphones be replaced by balanced armature earphones? 
There has been some argument recently about can dynamic earphones be replaced by balanced armature earphones? Some say that dynamic earphones have more than 50 years history, its technology is more mature than balanced armature earphones. Others thought that the balanced armature earphones have a bright future because it have smaller sound transducers. Therefore, I recognize that balanced armature earphones will have a further development because of new technology, and dynamic earphones will be replaced by balanced armature earphones in the near future. 1) the transducers of balanced armature earphones are smaller. Hence, balanced armature earphones can hold more transducers which covers different frequencies. 2) Dynamic earphones are easier to customize its covers, which is healthier for human to listen to music. 3) for earphones company, the yield of balanced earphones is higher than dynamic earphones'. At the same time, the quality of balanced earphones is easily to control.
