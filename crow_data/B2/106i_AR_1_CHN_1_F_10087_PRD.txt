Introduction 
In recent years, participating in different volunteer works gradually becomes a memorable experience in every student's life. They devote more passion and enthusiasm in volunteering than the past and spend more time on them. However, there is always a debate that the advantages of taking the volunteer works is far overweight than its disadvantages? Personally, I agree with this idea in two points: Firstly, participating volunteer works could enhance our comprehensive abilities, such as communication skills, critical thinking, etc. Secondly, we could devote ourselves and share our love for the society through the volunteer works. Although some parents might think there are some danger exists in these volunteer works and they are afraid that their children could be hurt from it, I still believe these problems have its solution and the advantages of volunteer works are greater than its harm.
