Argumentative Essay: Personalized Medicine 
Could you remember how many episodes you have watched for Grey's Anatomy? Do you know what kind of clinical trials were "performed" by the super medical team in this Drama? Do you remember once Dr. Bailey abandoned the treatment method that a seriously-ill little boy's parents selected, and used Personalized Medicine saved his life? It is to all of the audience happiness to find out a young and beautiful life is saved. However, Dr. Bailey, the person who in real made this miracle, was sued by the boy's parents. Not everyone consider Personalized Medicine as the best treatment method. Sometimes, individual believes that the most frequently used treatment method, for example, the Guideline based medicine, has less side-effect and has more reliable medical potency than Personalized Medicine. In my point of view, in order to receive better health care, patients need to be more confident in choosing Personalized Medicine as their treatment method. 
When choosing treatment method, people worried most of Personalized Medicine's effectiveness. Now, Personalized Medicine still cost a lot of time and money to get patients genomic differences to make medicine. Also, since every Personalized Medicine is tailored to treat only one certain patient and its effectiveness are only estimated by calculate the data selected from experiments. Many people feel using Personalized Medicine is not reliable and worth enough.
