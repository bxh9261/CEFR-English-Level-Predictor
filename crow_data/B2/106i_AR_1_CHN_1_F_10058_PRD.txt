Choir 
William Congreve once said:" Music has charms to sooth a savage breast, to soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak." Music, the best creation of human being, has its special power. It is a tool and also a gift for people in different culture to communicate. There are many forms of music performing. One can do solo; two can do duet; and a group of people can do choir. When singing in the choir, everyone combined his or her voice together and follow the lead of a director. People in the choir experience music as a team. Everyone can join a choir and many people like singing in a choir. I think the reason why many people like to join a choir is because joining a choir can benefit a person in many ways.
