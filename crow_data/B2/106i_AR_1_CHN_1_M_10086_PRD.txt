There has been much debate recently about what should be done to improve the user-experience of smartphones. Some say that the manufactors should put a large battery into the phone in order to make the phone last longer while using. Others think that the designer should do harder work and make the smartphone thinner and lighter, in order to have a better hands-on experience. However, a larger battery means a thicker and heavier phone. Therefore, the controversial topic kept existing among all the designers. 
1) A larger battery can provide a longer using time. 
2) Making the phone the width and the weigh of the phone can affect the user-experience by a lot. 
3) Too much improvement on either side can make the phone extremely expensive which can be the biggest killer of user-experience.
