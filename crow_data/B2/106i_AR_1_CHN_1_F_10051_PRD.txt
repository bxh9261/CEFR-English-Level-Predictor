Predictive Factors of Procrastination 
The phenomenon of procrastination has existed for much of history and continues to thrive in the modern day. According to the study, 80 to 95% of college students have admitted to procrastinating (Ellis and Knaus, 1977) while 50% of college students chronically procrastinate (Day et al. 2000). In addition, 15 to 20% of adults also chronically procrastinate (J. Harriott & Ferrari, 1996). Although it is certain that procrastination will bring many negative effects to themselves, including increased stress, lower grades and so on, students still engage into it. So the phenomenon makes researches to explore the reason to the question. Most of the experts hold the view that procrastination will be caused by various reasons such as low emotional intelligence, self efficacy of self-regulation. But I think the most predictive factor of procrastination is self efficacy to self- regulation. 
According to the research papers, Academic procrastination of undergraduates: low self-efficacy to self-regulate predicts higher levels of procrastination, written by Robert M. Klassen, Lindsey L. Krawchuk and Sukaina Rajani, the most predictive factor of procrastination is self efficacy to regulation. 
Repute the idea that emotion intelligence is also predictive factors to procrastination.
