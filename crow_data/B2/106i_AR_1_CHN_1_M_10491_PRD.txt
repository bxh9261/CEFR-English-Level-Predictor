Orange Chicken VS Peking Duck 
	Americans love Chinese food. As a matter of fact, Americans love Chinese food so much that NASA decided to send sweet and sour pork to space for their astronauts. However, what NASA thinks as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese in mainland. The truth is, most of the Chinese restaurants in US serve differently from mainland China. Many people debated about whether Chinese food should stay authentic all the time. Some think food should always taste the same so people can get the maximized experiences. Some think food should be modified so more people will have the opportunity to enjoy it. As a Chinese, I definitely want Chinese cuisine taste the same in US. But after I did some research and interview, I changed my mind. In my opinion, Chinese restaurants in US should modify the food most suitable for Americans based on the traditional Chinese recipes. It suppose to be tasted different and having different culture. 
	I used to complain about how bad the food in American Chinese restaurants are. If someone went to a Chinese restaurant, that means he want real Chinese food. Why would the restaurant give him something doesn't even taste like authentic Chinese food. Until I realized that most of the customers in Chinese restaurants are Americans, and dishes like "Orange Chicken" are the "real" Chinese food from their point of view.
