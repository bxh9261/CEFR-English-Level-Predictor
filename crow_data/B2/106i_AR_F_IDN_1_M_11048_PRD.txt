Challenges that Indonesian Christians Face 
Nowadays, people in the western hemisphere would look down at Islam because they would associate the religion to terrorism. Of course, this claim is not and will never ever be right. However, that is how some Muslims in Indonesia would look at Christians; they assume Christians are just pests who don't belong to live in this world. There are several recent controversies in Indonesia that was based on religions and how one is better than others really shows that Indonesians don't really have the absolute right on having one minor religion. In addition, being a Christian in Indonesia could be really challenging because of self-proclaiming Muslim terrorists' targeting Christians on their attacks, Indonesian government's incapability on constituting the rights of religion independence and people's keep harassing Christians in daily basis. 
First of all, I would say one of the reasons that Christians have difficulties living in Indonesia is the constant threat the terrorists keep posing to them. As a Christian who had live in Indonesia for almost 18 years, I had been through scary times many times because of the terrorist attacks launched constantly all over Jakarta for almost every year from 2004 until 2012 and the most recent one in 2016 The Associated Press, 2004. Although it was just my personal experience, I did feel like my friends and some other family members felt that too since it was clearly depicted through their attitudes and facial expressions at those times. In addition to my experience, the person who I interviewed, Annisa Bramantya, also felt that terrorists are oppressing Christians even more these days; she also added , "The fact that terrorists were proud of their actions that had killed many people and intended for Christians showed how wrong they were." <name> , interview, March 25, 2006. In short, I knew it was hard for Christians in general to live in Indonesia during attacks by self-called Muslim terrorists. 
In addition to the threat we face, Indonesian governments were and still are notorious for its incompetency in matters of maintaining the society to obey the law such religion equalities. There are many cases in which the Indonesian government should have been involved but decided not to. Events such as the banning of a church in Bogor which ended up in an unfair way for the Christians who go to the church Saudale, 2014. Such events are the proof of the incapability of government to make a fair and right decision that could benefit both sides. However, the Indonesian authority decided to close down the church and didn't do anything good for the Christians that go to the church. There were more signs that reflected the unfairness of the government's actions such as how many mosque were there if compared to other religious shrines and governments' being afraid or cooperative to one of the largest Islamic extremist groups called FPI The Jakarta Post, 2015. 
My final arguments on why being Christians could be uncomfortable is on the daily dose of harassment that I faced during my high school years in a notable Catholic school. My experience throughout my senior high school years was considerably unique in matters of harassment. There is a stereotype that most Muslims in Indonesia would believe if they see a Chinese descendant like me; he or she is either a Christian or a Buddhist which is kind of true. From this stereotype itself, people would judge me for being non-Muslims constantly on my ride home since I always took Indonesian public transportation all the way. I would face some elderly people who would talk to me about how wrong Christians are on worshipping Jesus my only Savior and some lady wearing hijabs would also rant on me for my belief in Christianity. In addition, it was not just me; some of my other friends who went to the same school would experience this at least once every week. From my and some friends' experiences for being judged as a Christian our self, I concluded it is hard to live in Indonesia as a Christian who would face constant threat or harassments. 
Although, there are some Muslims such Annisa that felt Indonesian Muslims is hurting Muslims even more, I didn't think she experience much harassments as what most Indonesian Christians would face in a frequent basis. I didn't even think she also experience the scary feelings on being a minority and threatened by bomb threats which was intended for Christians and what they have. However, I could see why she assumed that way since it is not only Christians who feel this, but also including some Muslims who think in the same way as most Indonesian Christians would think. But then, I didn't think those Muslims would experience this as severe as Christians would in general. 
In conclusion to my arguments, Christians suffer for living in Indonesia because we would face threats some people in public places and by terrorist attacks and would also not really be in the favor of the Indonesian governments. I really wanted to change any time in the future. Although this may sound impossible, the idea of being one is already embedded deep inside most Indonesians. I suggest that Indonesians should all look more to the deepest part of our hearts and reflect on our actions so that these acts of discriminations could be erased and annihilated from our lives
