China's easily influenced economy by environment 
From the information I have already collected in my synthesis paper and the interview report, bad environmental situations will influence each and every country's economy in the world. However, I think China is a special country whose economy has the characteristic of being easily influenced by environmental situation. In this paper, I would try to indicate that the reason why China's economy has this characteristic from the perspective of GDP, natural factors and national conditions. 
A large proportion of China's GDP is offset by overdrawing the ecological and environmental resources. In the past twenty years, 	China is one of the highest speed of economic development countries in the world. According to World Bank's research (2000), China's average economic growth rate is 10.3%. Ranked of the second among all the 206 countries and areas in the world. However, the waste of resources, the degeneration of ecology and the pollution of environment have largely offset the reality of GDP. Which means a large proportion of China's real GDP is deducted by the loss of natural capital and ecological deficit even though the nominal GDP is relatively high. The following table provides statistics: 
1985 
1990 
1995 
1999 
Nominal GDP deflator (%) 
33. 48 
37. 95

16. 80 
13.42We can see that the environmental factors were causing about 15% deduction of GDP deflator on average. That's a huge proportion of deduction caused by environment, especially for a country like China with such a high GDP base number. Which also means if we can solve these environmental problems, it will bring enormously increase to China's economy. 
Naturally, the cost of development in China is higher than the world's average level due to the congenital fragility of ecological environment. As is cited by Niu (2005), the ability of the form of ecological buffering power and self-purification power in China is much lower than the world's average. That's because of China's special geological situation. In China, more than 65% of the national territorial area is mountains and hills, about 1/3 is arid and semiarid area and 17% is the roof of the world. The area of water and soil loss is about 4 million km2. The average altitude of China is 1. 77 times of the world's average. These natural factors consist of China's fragility of ecological environment. And that means China needs to spend more cost on every economic activities. According to the research from Word Resources (1998), based on the fundamental relationship between Ecological Stress Index, Relief Degree of Land Surface and Regional Development Cost, we can get the Developmental Cost Ratio (China: World's average): 
Livestock husbandry development cost 
1. 03 
Agriculture development cost 
1. 05 
Industry development cost 
1. 25 
Mining industry development cost 
1. 30 
Infrastructure construction cost 
1. 35 
Natural protection cost 
1. 25 
Erosion control cost 
1. 40 
Natural disaster frequency 
1. 18 
Ecology recovery cost 
1.25These numbers demonstrate that due to the existed geological environment, China needs to pay more money compared to the world's average on each and every economic activities. That also explains why China's economy is more easily to be influenced by the environmental situation. 
Besides, the basic national conditions also make China's economy more "sensitive" to the environment. China now is one of the biggest developing countries in the world and one of the most polluted countries as well. As is cited by Macbean (2007), a study on China's environment problems and policies, environmental degradation in China was costing the economy eight per cent annually, mostly due to the air and water pollution. The figure would be greatly increased if the costs of deforestation, droughts and floods were added. The pollution situation in China is becoming out-of-control nowadays. However, the Chinese government is also facing with many other urgent issues which can be seen in all developing countries. According to my interviewee, Mr. <name> from Purdue University, "The negative influence of environment can be amplified because the insufficient protection input." The governmental funds are being used for some much more urgent issues like poverty and education. Moreover, with less money put on the environmental protection, the environmental situations of the China are easily tend to become worse. 
In conclusion, due to the GDP proportion, existed natural situation and basic national conditions, China is a country which is more easily influenced by environmental situations. As a suggestion, I think China should try to make the economic transition as soon as possible. Move the high resource consumption and waste businesses into environmental-friendly or environmental protection businesses, which will keep the number of jobs, reduce the pollution also the proportion of environmental deduction in GDP.
