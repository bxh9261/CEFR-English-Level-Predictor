Potential of a Startup 
According to yourstory.com, $7. 3 billion were invested in Indian startups in three quarters of 2015. Flipkart's valuation touches $15 Billion after raising $700 million, features trek.com. Paytm raises $500 million in 2015, making Alibaba an official investor, confirmed by Economic Times. According to Entrepreneur.com, Airbnb received another round funding for another $100 million on November 23,2015. These are the rare startups, the ones that have been in the market for no more than 10 years. Most of these companies like Flipkart, Airbnb are less than 5 years old and are competing with corporate giants which are more than 30 years old. The astonishing part being that people would rather work with the likes of Yahoo, Google and Delloite. The general audience, still in pursuit of job security are afraid of the startup being chewed up by the aforementioned giants. This comes as no surprise, the success rate of startups being as low as 20%. 
The question at hand, is salary everything? Certainly not, there is much more that goes into a job than being able to earn a ton. First and foremost is the heart pounding experience that you get in a startup, these companies are small and are expanding themselves. Which means there is development and progress happening at each and every stage. This knowledge would help you grow more in life and one could use this acumen to gain success in their own venture. Needless to say, the potential to grow is immense. One enables themselves to soar higher in the firm's hierarchy with ease in comparison with an established giant. The science behind this is how your work is converted into direct results that are prominent enough to be seen as financial gains in the firm. This gives the liberty of being able to revert the fallbacks and do the damage control easily so as to not jeopardize the firm's financial value. The reflection is quick because it is in the growing stage while in the corporates they have reached a stage which is stagnant in growth, therefore the small change in policies are not reflected for a longer period of time. 
Furthermore, your job at a startup is varied - it might require you to handle the accountancy of the firm even if you're a developer evangelist. This scenario, usually frowned upon is in fact an amazing thing for those who know how to explore opportunities. It offers an unparalleled learning curve. Working hours are usually not the best, but they're tailored to your needs - you can be the guy who codes all night and sleeps during the day. Best part? It is perfectly fine if you're one of them. The close knit circle that a startup offers keeps you in good stead socially being surrounded by like minded youngsters filled with a burning passion to achieve. 
In conclusion, it is only fair to say that startups offer more than it meets the eye. They have more opportunities to grab than one can grasp in their time at a startup. The key, is just to be humble and willing enough.
