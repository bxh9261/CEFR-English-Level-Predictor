The impact of video games to college students 
	Gaming has become much more popular than before. Almost every students play video games or computer games in their free time. It is the same for me; I usually spend week day or after-study time by playing games. However, everything has two sides of effect, good or bad. Still, lots of people say that video games will decrease student's GPA, affect their physical health, which makes them stay in front of TV all day lone. To explore and find out the benefits of the video games, I had interviewed the Professor <NAME>who is an associate professor in clinical psychology, and done literature research on articles. After researching, I found that we can benefit from video games a lot. For example, we can improve our visual attention and exercise our brain; we can improve our personality to increase humanity, and we can improve our communication skills and have more methods to study. I will use my examples and research to argue that videos games also have benefits on us. 
	Firstly, video games can improve our visual attention and brain activity. According to the BBC News article " Horizon: how video games can change your brain" Prof. Daphne Bavelier made a test to verify the relationship between visual abilities and video games. He found that people who play action games will have better record than those who don't. He concluded that action games needed players' eyes chase the moving character to complete the mission, which means their eyes exercise much often. For example, when playing super Mario, player needs to control the Mario to jump and down through the map, and use eyes to focus the mario's movement. Furthermore, in the article, the professor Simone Kuhn also agreed that video games did have benefit on brain. During the research, she played games SUPER MARIO 64DS for two months, and she found there were three parts of brain which had grown. Also, during my interview with Dr. <NAME>he gave me an example; he said when people play first personal shooting game, like Battel Fields, the game would require players to focus every part of the screen and switch position as quickly as possible. Conclusively, video games will improve our reaction time and visual attention. I totally agree with the point that video games can improve our visual attention, because after I play the video games, I found I react fast than before, like stealing the basketball in the court and even win the porker games easily. 
	Secondly, the article " Effects of playing Video Games on Perceptions of One's Humanity" by Tobias Greitemyer states that video games have effect on the perceptions of one's humanity. And this supports my claim that video games will change ourselves' humanity. Tobias made a theory that prosocial video games may increase perception of humanity and some violence games may decrease the perception of humanity. During the Tobias Greitemyer's research, participants will decide which games to play, a prosocial(Pingus), a neutral( Tetris), or a violent( call of duty 2). After playing the game, participants would rate their humanity, whether they may be more violent or not. They would fill out the form on a 7-point Likert-type scale, point from 1 to 7. In a conclusion, based on the detailed statistics, it's useful for us to know that prosocial video games will improve our perceptions of humanity. Moreover, in the interview with Dr. <NAME>he said that some intelligent games and mystery games will also have benefits on us. For instance, challenging puzzle and mystery game usually required players use their brain to find the key to get sequence ques and answer to complete the mission. Also, the game like "The Witcher", which is making choice game, would require players make decisions all the time and think ahead about the development of the game. During the Witcher, players need to choose the episode by themselves, whether to kill the monster or leave the monster, or express the bad feeling to NPC. Dr. <NAME>argued that video games would benefit on our physical health. Like doing some Kinect games (player stand in front of the TV and follow the instruction in TV) "just dance," "push up" also exercised our body at the same time. I usually play dance game and mystery games during free time to relax. I agree with what Dr. <NAME>and author said. I usually use this type of game as kind of work out during my lose weight process, and I found it is helpful and useful foe me. 
	Last but not least, "video games in education" by Yan, Lim ; Pei Lim; Lazim, Azmawati demonstrates that video games can provide us more methods to learn new things and improve social skills in the society. In the article, Anderson points out that using unfamiliar teaching tools will motivate students to be curious about new study tools and learn more about them. For example, the pilot flight simulator plays an important role in flying study course. Students will fly in the imagined world and using flying skills without life risk. During the interview, the Dr. <NAME>talked to me that video games were useful for social skills. Video games have chatting platform, and people can talk there even speak there, like game league of legends not only require single players' skill but also communication skills. In the game, players should talk to each other about the situation of the game to win the game. From what Dr <NAME>and my research said, video games indeed play important role in social life. I agree the point the author gave, during the continued communication, players can improve the social skills and play video games at the same time. 
	Although playing video games have a lot of benefits, on the other hand, some people believe that video games are bad for people. They think video games will distract students from studying, video games will make people more violent and even do harmful to others, and video games will make people lonely at home and they never talk to each others. However, in my opinion, video games have a lot of benefit for us. According to my review and research, video games can make people focus on study to have time for games; video games have benefit on our humanity, like increasing our personality, and video games will bring us to another communication world where we communicate, which will improve social skills and not be stay alone at home and do things by themselves. 
	All in all, according to the research about articles and interview with the Dr. <NAME>. I have to come to a conclusion that video games really have benefits on us. We can improve visual attention and reaction time from the video games; we can improve social skills and study method from the video games, and we can improve our personal perception of humanity from video games. No doubt, we can't totally deny the video games but also play them for time to time.
