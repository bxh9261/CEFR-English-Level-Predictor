To Stay or Not to Stay, This is a Question 
At Purdue University, there is over ten percent of the population from China and over thirty percent from all over the world. What would happen to a domestic student when all of his or her international friends graduate and come back to their home countries? How would the social network continue if one or many of it being broken? What actions would employees do in order to make diversity? Apparently, the increasing international population has grabbed people's attention. However, people care too much about the how they deal with culture shock and different behavior styles. What should be paid more attention to is what they truly bring to this society and how can they better stay in this society. Career, for many students, is a final goal of going to universities. It's the same for the international students as well. As an important part of evaluation, internships usually are the best way to get experience and also extra money. For international students, the situation of getting internships is much more complicated than others. Based on research and interview, I conclude that international students encounter many difficulties while they try to find an internship and some of the reasons are biased. 
Body 1 
One of the reason is that people from the society tend to view international students as "outsiders" and thus they are not really willing to give out working spots. 
-Inhospitality from local people 
Body 2 
Many international students choose to leave the United States after they finish the college life. 
-Companies are not willing to train those who won't contribute in the future 
-The past history makes employees hesitate when they are considering hiring international students 
Body 3 
Politics plays an important role. 
-Government and law regulations 
-Protection of technology
