Role of the SAT in the admission process for students 
		The need for the SAT has been often debated. My view is that the SAT should be modified such that it is more effective. Having a separate SAT exam for each country conducted by a single body, like The College Board would help solve the problem or at least improve the testing process. Having such an exam could help eliminate factors such as ethnic race, language background affecting exam scores. I have reached this conclusion after doing research and interviewing an expert in this field. 
Need for a common test 
A common test score is very useful in the admission process. It helps compare students who have had different High School education. In a sense, it ensures a more level playing field as Mr. Iler talked about in the interview (personal communication, March 23, 2015). The drawback though is that the scores of a student in the exam might be influenced by their ethnic race and language background ( Zwick & Sklar, 2005) . So, there needs to be a way in which the students still have a common exam but are not unfairly chosen or left out for that matter. 
Alternative to the traditional SAT 
	The exam should be made separate such that people living in different regions of the world would have a different kind of test based on what they have learned in High School. College Board would still be conducting the tests, giving students the feel of a common exam. Also, instead of having three sections each of the same subject, the scope of testing the student can be increased by including more testing areas. Again as said before, these extra testing areas would stem from what the students from the same country have learnt in High School. For example, students who have taken more Calculus classes than others might have a bit more Mathematics in their paper and people who have taken Science courses might be tested a bit more in Science. This way the SAT becomes an exam which tests a student on how good they are at what they have learnt earlier and that makes the exam a more purposeful one. By including the subjects, it would thus factor in some elements of the SAT subject tests making the SAT a broader exam. The exam should also contain an essay section which has a topic that is much relevant to the student. The essay in this paper would test the writing skills of the students and also add to the number of factors being considered in the admission process. 
Simplifying the admission process 
	Choosing a set number of students from thousands of applications, is a hard process and involves various components such as the reviewing the GPA, SAT scores, personal essays, recommendation letters, etc. Since different countries have different education systems, the GPAs would be different based on what students learn. This is the reason the SAT is included in the admission process. What if students are chosen by comparing their applications with applications of students from the same country? That is, a student from China is compared with other students from China and this would be the same with students from other countries. This would be called the Quota System in some countries. The new proposed exam would not cause any harm to this new kind or "modified" admission process. 
The Quota System would not be too bad as it would ensure that the best students from each country are chosen based on their scores in the proposed form of the SAT. The only problem that colleges would face would be setting the number of students they would want to choose from each country. This problem could be overcome by reviewing previous records of admitted students. The number of students from the US should be kept at a constant and high number though to ensure their majority in college. 
	The proposed exam might not be highly predictive of success of a student in college as say (1) Conscientiousness of a person, (2) In-class attendance, etc. (Conard, 2006), but it could certainly improve the effectiveness of the admission process and eliminate situations such as ethnicity, language background, etc. affecting the scores of students. With the new kind of exam and a modified admission review process, the quality of students chosen could be taken to a whole new level.
