China's Vulnerable Economy by Environment 
Bad environmental situations influence each and every country's economy in the world. However, countries have distinguished situations like the differences between developing and developed countries. Developing countries are usually facing with more environmental problems. In this paper, I would try to argue that the China's particular economy's characteristic of vulnerability from the perspective of GDP and natural factors. 
A large proportion of China's GDP is offset by overdrawing the ecological and environmental resources, which means the environmental factors influence China's economy to a large extent. There's a table from the World Bank's report (2000) provided us with some statistics. 
As we can observe from Table 1, there are three ecological indexes inside the table, forests, CO2, and the total natural deductions on our GDP. Even though the total natural deduction has a decreasing trend from 1985 to 2000, it still weighs a lot compared to the educational expense rate, which means environmental influence on our economics has outweighed the outlay of education. From the last row we can see that the environmental factors cause about 15% deduction of GDP deflator each year on average. That's a huge proportion of deduction caused by environment, especially in a country like China with such a high GDP base number, which also means if we can solve these environmental problems, it will bring enormously increase to China's economy. 
In the past twenty years, China is one of the fastest economic development countries in the world. According to World Bank's report (2000), China's average economic growth rate is 10.3%, ranking of the second among all the 206 countries and areas in the world. However, the waste of resources, the degeneration of ecology and the pollution of environment have offset the real GDP largely. Which means a large proportion of China's real GDP is deducted by the loss of natural capital and ecological deficit even though the nominal GDP is relatively high.

Note. GDP deflator is a measure of the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It can also reflect the GDP level compared to other years. Naturally, the cost of development in China is higher than the world's average level due to the congenital fragility of ecological environment. According to the research from Word Resources (1998), based on the fundamental relationship between Ecological Stress Index, Relief Degree of Land Surface and Regional Development Cost, we can get the Developmental Cost Ratio (China: World's average) as demonstrated in Table Two. 
As we can see from the table, all the cost ratios are larger than one which demonstrates that due to the existed geological environment, China needs to pay more money compared to the world's average on each and every economic activities, from livestock industry to infrastructure construction cost. On erosion cost, China even needs to pay 40% more under the same circumstances, compared with other countries in the world. That explains why China's economy is more easily to be influenced by the environmental situation. 
As is cited by Niu (2005), the ability of the form of ecological buffering power and self-purification power in China is much lower than the world's average. That's because of China's special geological situation. In China, more than 65% of the national territorial area is mountains and hills, about 1/3 is arid and semiarid area and 17% is the roof of the world. The area of water and soil loss is about 4 million square kilometers. The average altitude of China is 1. 77 times of the world's average. These natural factors make up China's fragility of ecological environment. And that means China needs to spend more money on every economic activity. The numbers from the table translate these natural factors into economic statistics.

Note. The ratios are between China and the World's average level. In conclusion, environmental factors have taken too much proportion of China's GDP and China's geological situation makes the developmental cost higher than world's average. These two factors contribute to China's vulnerability by environmental situations. As a suggestion, I think China should try to make the economic transition as soon as possible. Move the high resource consumption and waste businesses into environmental-friendly or environmental protection businesses, which will keep the number of jobs and reduce the pollution also the proportion of environmental deduction in GDP.
