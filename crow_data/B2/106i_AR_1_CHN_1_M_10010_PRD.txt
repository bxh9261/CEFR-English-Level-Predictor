Thesis: 
To avoid even more Fiscal, government shouldn't take the job, since this project is no way to make any money to support itself and then it turns into a nowhere. The future of electric cars is promising and greatly beneficial for public but the technology need to go on developing. 
There are people who have been expecting the technology of electric cars would improve people's life. They are so eager to seek the support by government, and that means to pay the taxpayers' money to electric car companies. But this wouldn't help, no matter how much the government pay, the inconvenience of electric cars is not going to change, so people wouldn't buy them and companies won't make profits. Issuing government to do this would result in corruption and waste of tax. 
What people might argue against my thesis: 
To reduce the pollution made by transportation, electric cars should seek more support from public. For example, in order to make the electric cars more convenient to use, government could issue some policies for electric car companies to build more recharge stations and invest more on basic electricity facilities. 
Most electric cars need to recharge a lot, and so far this is the biggest drawback. To solve this problem, more recharge stations need to be built. Building a recharge station is very expensive and need a relatively longer time to have profits, so electric car companies, especially which just started, are not capable to make such an investment. Now, to realize the great future of the public, government and other instruments really need to give a hand.
