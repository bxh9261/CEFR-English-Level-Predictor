Claiming as the Position of Objecting to Dress Code 
	Adopting dress code in public school become very common in nowadays and it is very controversial that dress code may offer positive consequences but also negative effects to students. As a student who had an experience of wearing dress code from kindergarten to high school, I chose dress code for the main topic to explore to figure out its actual impacts on students. Through exploring several articles about dress code, an interview with an expert, and personal experience, I decide to hold the opposition of adopting dress code at school. 
	However, some supporters might argue dress code is definitely beneficial because it enhances students' academic abilities, forms unity of students as a group, offers sense of belonging, and regulate students' behavior. For instance, the supporter of dress code, Mr. Dixon, the charge of dress code policies at Stony Brook High School, NY, claimed that dress code made somber atmosphere to encourage to concentrate so that students can easily focus on studying. 
	However, negative feedbacks of dress code are more powerful to discourage adopting dress code. Through some articles, 16 years-old girl Mayer proved attire does not matter to act bad behavior through having a conversation with her principal. Since her principal believed inner characteristics commit the crime and dress code cannot regulate the human nature. 
	Moreover, three seventh graders claimed that dress code does not help to increase academic ability.
