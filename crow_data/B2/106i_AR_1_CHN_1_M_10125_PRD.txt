"Doing more with less" means that doing more work with less time. Apparently, if college students have a good skill of time management, they will achieve college success more easily. Procrastination and absence in turning in assignments are the consequences of bad time management. I think it is important for college students to learn about time management, because time management helps students be more effective and stay on top of their study to get higher grades. 
One main reason is that time management skills can help students organize their time and tasks. Priority is the first step students need to consider when they manage their time. Comparing precedences of all tasks they have during a specific time period, students need to finish the task with the highest priority first. Sometime when students feel they seemingly finish lots of trivial works, but when checking the schedule, they find out that important works are not done. Therefore, when students have lots of works, precedence is the most important factor in time management. In the article I used in synthesis paper, "The Study Efficacy of Time Management Training on Increase Academic Time Management of Students"1, authors conclude that time management skills influence students' grades more potentially, implying that students need to insist on time management as a long term planning. Students need to consider their situation and make different plans, such as: long term planning, short term planning and so on. Plans themselves should be as clear and simple as possible, whereas students need time to maintain their manage tools. According to all authors in my synthesis paper and my interviewee, it is important for students to recognize their own rhythm. They need to reorganize schedule based on their rhythm. For example, students need to find out when do they have highest productivity and then place some difficult works on that period. Relaxing time is also a fundamental part in time management. Time management does not means students have to keep studying all the time, an appropriate amount of leisure time is needed in student's time management. 
Another reason is that time management can reduce the possibility of losing points due to accident. For example, a printed paper is due tomorrow. Unfortunately, printers are all broken so that the student can not find anywhere to print his work. As the result, he loses some points of this assignment. However, what if the student planned time early? The answer is obvious that the student will not lose points due to printing. Good time management is a good way to remind students about deadlines. Setting goals and inspirations can help students develop their time management more easily. 
Some may argue that although students manage their time, they do not have high efficiency during some period. For example, when feeling over fatigue, students can not do things in their schedule under the maximum efficiency. I understand the situation because I also met this before. Flexibility is one of basic factors of a good time plan. Schedule is not a list of mandatory tasks. It is important for students to change their schedules according to situations they are in. Students also need to find their own rhythm. For example, during some specific period, the student have a relatively high efficiency. Therefore, it is effective to put important and burdensome works in that period. Others may also argue that bad time management skills can also result in some undesirable consequences. I accept their points, but good time management skills can make good results. Good time management skills are skills that students come up with after they understand their own situations. Bad results are warnings for students who apply time management skills. They need to consider to reorganize their schedule, choose different skills and insist on time management. Some efficient skills for one student may not useful for other students. It is basic for students to find their own good skills. 
In conclusion, good time management is helpful for students with their life in college when they find their own suitable skills. It is also useful for students to learn about time management skills.
