Nowadays, frequent employee turnover has restricted the development of hotel businesses. It has been increasingly recognized that the competition between hotel businesses is actually the competition of numbers of highly educated employees. As a result, there has been much discussion recently about what causes employee turnover. Some hotel managers believe that the issue of wages is the most important reason. However, in most cases, job dissatisfaction led to more job-hopping of employees. It can be characterized as ability utilization, the need for achievement, the chance for the promotion, company policies, and compensation. Because of the ineffective communication between staff and hotel managers, inadequate compensation, and lack of opportunities for professional development, employees choose to quit their company. 
Topic sentence 1: The first reason that causes employee turnover is the ineffective communication between staff and hotel managers. 
Topic sentence 2: The second reason is inadequate compensation. 
Topic sentence 3: Finally, due to lack of opportunities for individual development, employees tend to leave their organizations. 
Refutation: It has been claimed that wage in the hospitality and tourism industry is relatively low, so many employees decide to quit their jobs. Nevertheless, according to a research, most departed staff leave their organizations because their companies fail to provide them with professional development opportunities. 
Concluding statement: In short, because of the ineffective communication between staff and hotel managers, inadequate compensation, and lack of opportunities for professional development, employees in the hospitality and tourism industry choose to quit their company.
