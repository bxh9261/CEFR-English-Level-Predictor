Online Shopping 
Can you spend a day without browsing Facebook or Instagram? Can you choose to not surfing on the Internet when you are free? Can you imagine your life without Internet? I believe most people's answer will be "NO." With the development of modern society, internet is becoming more and more popular among people in different ages and almost turn into one of people's necessities for life. People can do a lot of things on internet, like reading online books and watching online movies. However, today I am going to talk about the other thing people can do by using internet-online shopping. Online shopping is an act of purchasing products or services directly from sellers over the Internet by using web browser. It has gradually come into a fashion in many cities. Then raised a concern that whether online shopping can benefit people or not. As far as I am concerned, online shopping is important because it is very convenient and people can buy the stuff they want by just browsing the company's website without walking around. 
First and foremost, the biggest advantage of online shopping is probably its convenience. Different from shopping in stores, there are no lines for people to wait in or shopping assistants to bother you, and people can do and finish their shopping in just a few minutes with only two steps: choosing the products and placing the order. Moreover, online shopping is really a good choice for people who are very busy because they are not restricted by the time and the place anymore. People can buy products at any time they wanted, for example the break between their works and the time they having lunch, because as long as people have internet connection they are able to access the shopping website. According to the article "Consumers' attitude towards online shopping: Factors influencing employees of crazy domains to shop online" by Saad Akbar and Paul TJ James, convenience is the first reason employee, groups who are always very busy, to do online shopping. 
Secondly, a convincing advantage of online shopping is that people are able to have a better price. The first reason for that is people can easily browse through dozens of different website for the same kind of product. This can help them find to best price. Although people can also do the same at a mall, it would take a lot of time and maybe also a long walk. The second reason that cheap deals and better prices are available online is products come to people are directly from the manufacturer or seller without middle people who are always adding prices in order to get more profits being involved. Also, many online shoppers often offer discount for customers. Take my own experience as an example, I went to the Tmall last Sunday and was attracted by a pair of sneaker, which was priced by 90 dollars. I really liked it, but I thought it was a little bit expensive. My friend then suggested me to find it on the Internet because she said that there is always cheaper price to shop online. As we expected, it was only priced by 84 dollars on the website and cost me 80 dollars finally after a discount. 
However, some people hold different opinions about online shopping. Based on what <name>, a graduated student who I interviewed before, said. For consumers, the biggest problem is probably that there are always some differences between the real product and the product in picture on the website. In the past, most online shopping website did not have the service of free returning for customers. On the other hand, nowadays, online shopping system has improved a lots by including not only some other people's shopping experiences with the products they bought, but also their comments on the products. As a result, it is easier for people to know the "reality" and help them to make decision whether the product worth that price. Moreover, most online shopping system today have the policy of free changing and returning in nearby store, which can be very convenient for people. 
As a conclusion, in this fast developed society, there is a tendency for people using advanced technology to improve their life quality. And in order to get more convenience and benefits, people need to figure out how exactly this technology can contribute to society. I am glad that I am able to get know about this after reading some articles and interview the experts.
