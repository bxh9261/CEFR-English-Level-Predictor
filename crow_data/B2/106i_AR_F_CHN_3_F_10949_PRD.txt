Argumentative paper: BST is not as scary as you think 
Introduction 
Bovine Somatotropin (BST) is a protein hormone produced by cows' pituitary gland which is used to regulate metabolic processes (Charlotte, n.d., p. 1). During lactation, BST serves to mobilize body fat to use for energy and diverts feed energy more toward milk production (Charlotte, n.d., p. 1). Because of the ability of BST to increase milk production by 10-15%, it is produced and injected into cows to boost their milk production. 
The application of BST not only makes milk available to more people, but also reduces the use of resources like land, feed and water by increasing feed efficiency (Liu, 2016, p. 1). However, even though the safety and benefit of using BST are demonstrated, the debate on its usage has never stopped, since BST first appeared on market.
