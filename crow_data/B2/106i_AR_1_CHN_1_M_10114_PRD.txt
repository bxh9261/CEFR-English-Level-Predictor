What's your choice? 
Just imagine such a situation: You are now in the classroom. All you have is a pencil, a blank paper and a laptop. Your professor is giving a lecture that you have to take notes to gather the information you need for exam. What's your choice? Use a pencil and a blank paper, or a laptop? 
	That's kind of choice we have to make between hand-writing and technology-writing. No matter you are a child, an adult or a teacher, an engineer or a man, a woman, no one can escape that. Therefore, I choose this topic "hand-writing and technology-writing" to help you answer this question, to deeper understand what both modes of writing are. 
What position do I choose to stand at?
