	Does promotion has positive impact on retail market? 
	There has been much debate recently about promotions in retail market. Some people state that promotion has negative impact on both consumers and manufacturers or markets. They say that customers are waiting for the promotions and companies have to pay for the storage fee until they have to make discounts. Others think that promotion is a good tool in retail market because it can benefits both sides by balancing the demand and supply. If something does not sells well, companies can use promotion as a tool to attract price sensitive customers to help them "clear" the storage. For the price sensitive customers, they also get benefit from the promotion, which is low price. I propose second idea and believe that promotion is a useful tool in retail market. From my research and knowledge, there are lots of benefits of promotions and some of them are not discovered yet. We cannot say promotion is bad before we totally understand how it works in retail market.
