First part - scientific = can explain certain phenomenon 
* The "Wave - Particle Duality" 
(The double - slit experiment & the photoelectric effect) 
* Quantum Entanglement 
(The experiment of a pion decay) 
* Applications (Make use of it!) 
(Several examples with brief explanations) 
Mid part - Refutation 
* Experiment / Paradox of Schrodinger's cat 
(A cat being alive and dead at the same time? That is not scientific) 
Last part - Rejection and conclusion 
* Another double - slit experiment & The uncertainty principle 
(The idea of wave functions) 
* It is not quantum physics being unscientific, it is just still incomplete. 
* Conclusion 
Is quantum physics scientific? 
For many people, that must be a weird and awkward question. What is quantum physics? Should not science subjects all scientific? Please do not rush, let us go through those ideas one after another. 
Quantum, is described as the smallest unit of information or energy can be transferred every single time; and for quantum physics, is generally the study of the microscopic world of matters, but usually things in this world do not behave the same as our interpretations. Now, how can we define if a subject or term is scientific? In my view, if a term is scientific, it must be able to explain certain phenomenon, and what is more, can be used as real - world applications.

Up to here, you probably have a general understanding of these terms in quantum physics, and everything explained so far seemed to make sense; however, there are voices claiming that quantum physics is not scientific at all as it cannot define or describe the actual state or situation of a system in a specific period of time, and he uses the Paradox of Schrodinger's cat for supporting his viewpoint. Here, this paradox is about putting a cat inside a sealed box, which contains a device that have fifty-fifty chance of killing the cat. Our only way to find out whether the cat is dead or alive, is to open the box. The paradox suggests that in this situation, the cat is being alive and dead the same time inside the box before our observation takes place. That man claims that as we can never see a cat being alive and dead at the same time in our daily lives, or in labs, quantum physics is therefore not scientific. 
To somewhat extent, he is correct. Quantum physics still cannot explain certain situations; however, another idea in quantum physics can actually partly explain this paradox.

Now, as you can see, it is not actually the case that quantum physics is not scientific - it is just quantum physics is still being uncompleted, like an incomplete moon. Even though its ability - explaining certain phenomenon and standing as real - world applications - has already proved it being scientific, formed the general shape of it, it is still not a full moon yet. It is still waiting for new discoveries in silence. Just like the shivering shock brought to the world by quantum physics itself one hundred years ago, will there be another tempest shaking the knowledge tower of mankind in the near future?
