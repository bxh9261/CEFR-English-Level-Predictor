Jeremy Lin advance Asians in his own way 
Three years ago, Asian basketball player Jeremy Lin led a "Linsanity Time" across the whole USA. He attracted the spotlight all over the world by his unbelievable performance in NBA. Lin was nobody, but after two weeks, he was known everywhere because he[ZH1] led his underdog team into the playoffs. Nevertheless, a lot of opponent objected to Lin by stating that Lin achieved vitally insignificant achievement with outrageous fortune. As a matter of fact, beyond[ZH2] his impact on his team-the New York Knicks.[ZH3] Lin also help the whole American Asian advance in this modern society. 
One can never over-emphasize the influence of Jeremy Lin on American Asians. To begin with, Lin's success in athletics broke the main stereotype that Asian males are athletically awkward, and not being masculine enough. However, a lot of critics (Matt Vella 2012) argued that Lin has never been excellent in basketball, what he did is only a short eruption and he will fade away as soon as possible . Any player can peak and play well in one or two games and then decline, especially the Asian players. (Dat_balla 2014). In their mind, the emaciated Asian player cannot gain any advantage in the highest level of sports associations which are never less than physically intense. Nevertheless, Lin utilized his flexibility and unstoppable speed impressed most of individuals. No matter how hard the defense the rival imposed on Lin, Lin always had his way to score. Lin demonstrated the view that there were numerous athletic talents in Asian community by action. Except for Lin, Yao Ming, Ichiro, Hideki Matsui, Manny Pacquiao also achieved great feat in sports and they became more famous after Lin appeared. However, until that time, most of Asians had still tied up with the impression that Asians are nerds.. Lin But Jeremy Lin not only achieved academic success that he graduated from Harvard University with average GPA 3. 51 in Economics but also obtained high techniques in basketball.( ALISON SCHWARTZ 2012) Gradually, Lin represented American Asian students of the new age, becoming versatile in both sports and academy. The fact is that the impression about the Asians are changing. 
What's more, Lin's growing experience became a great reference when Asian parents try to develop their children. According to the interview set by CNN, Lin mentioned that when he was young, his parents always encouraged him to play sports for fun after he finished his homework, which cause a lot of criticism from other parents. In other Asian parents' eyes, their children must be successful, so they pour too much pressure on their children. From the time when children's age is 5, the Asian parents forced them to learn piano, ballet and martial arts. Asian Parents don't allow their children to have their own childhood, and parents will try their best to fill all kinds of learning tasks into their children's schedule. On the contrary, Lin's parents are really "weird". According to CNN, they not only "indulged" Lin to play outside, but also even played with him. When Lin's parents found Jeremy Lin was keen on basketball, they even organized games in their community to let their child practice. There is no denying that traditional and common educational mode of Asian parents cultivated a lot of high-score students, but to be honest, the children are extremely lack of emotional quotient, communication skill and even independence. In other words, some of the Asian children fostered by the traditional educational mode are useless to the society except for getting high scores in exams. In addition, the high pressure the Asian parents press on their children causes the suicide rate for young Asians from 15 to 16 years old to increase. ( Heron, M. 2011) [ZH5]According to the report provided by American Psychological Association, the suicide rate for young Asians rose from 13.5% to 15.7% in recent five years. The two main factors attributed to the suicide are mental illness and social factors. As far as I am concerned, the presence of depressive and anxiety disorders usually came from the pressure the Asian parents impose on their children[ZH6]. Due to absence of social activities before, Asian students easily suffer from social failure than other native-born students. However, Jeremy Lin parent rarely pushed Lin so much, what they did was that just letting Lin follow his heart to play basketballs. By force of playing basketball, Lin not only improved his basketball skill but also enhance his leadership and team spirit. Nowadays Lin's success in both academy and athleticism render ever-more Asian parents to give up the outdated educational mode and to adopt Lin's parents' American style educational mode. 
A lot of people thought Jeremy Lin's impact was limited and decreasing. Once Jeremy Lin fell from grace, he would receive ridicules and disappear soon. However, "Linsanity" was not an occasional incident. On the contrary, it embodied a fact that Asian community desired for attention. There is no doubt that Asians contributed a lot to United States, but they haven't receive something they deserved in return. So Asian groups are taken in the embarrassing position: They got a really large number of population, but they didn't possess corresponding speaking power. Consequently, avid for attention, when Jeremy Lin performed well in NBA, American Asians advocated Lin crazily so that they put Jeremy Lin at the center of the spotlight. Meanwhile, the Asians groups behind by Lin received attentions too. In this way, a lot of public will of Asians community could surface, and then US government may pay more attention to that, which improve Asian group. In this situation, Jeremy Lin acted as a representative of Asian groups who chased for "American dream" and functioned as a bridge between American Asians and public. In fact, Jeremy Lin unconsciously elevated the whole American Asians' status. 
Once Asians gain their own speaking power, Asian community will boom in a short time. Under this background, there must be enormous Asian elites swarming into all kinds of fields, which will prosper the economy of the global community in great possibility. Therefore, Lin's impact, far exceeding that on the basketball courts, had a profound meaning to advancement of Asians. Without Lin's appearance, Asian may stay in the embarrassing position for at least 10 years. From Bruce Lee to Jeremy Lin, we had waited for too long.
