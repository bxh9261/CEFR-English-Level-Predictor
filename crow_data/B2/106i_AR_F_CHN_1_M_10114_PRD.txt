What's your choice? 
Just imagine, you are in a situation where all you have is a pencil, a sheet of paper and a laptop. Your professor is giving a lecture on material where you will be tested later on. You have the choice to either take notes with the laptop or a pencil and a paper. What will you choose? 
	That's kind of a choice we have to make every day in class. This is such a common dilemma in today's society among students, adults, teachers since technology has been so advanced. Therefore, I chose the topic of comparing hand-writing and technology-writing to help one better analyze their choice and understand how hand-writing and technology-writing helps one. 
What position do I choose to stand at?
