Homosexual Argumentative Essay 
Homosexual is a controversial topic so far. There are a lot of organization that favors advancing homosexuals rights. Similarly, we could hear some news about anti-gay parade from all around world. After I did lots of research about this topic and interviewed <name>, who is a Ph D majoring in Psychological Science, people should understand and respect the homosexuals, not being anti-homosexuals from my perspective. I will demonstrate my opinion in sight of health infection of homosexual, what influences homosexuals' sexual orientation and social problems caused by homosexual. 
First of all, the homosexuals are not promiscuous as people considering (<name> , personal communication, March, 2015.) Actually, they have the same sexual attitude with straight people. Of course, some may say the existence of homosexual would increase the rate of some disease infections according to some academic reports, which demonstrates homosexuals is a high-risk group of HIV and some other sexually transmitted diseases. However, the infections occurring is not because of their promiscuities but because of the way of intercourse of the homosexuals, which they have sex in anus. In addition, referring to CDC (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention), also shows that if homosexuals take protection when they have sex, the rate of being infected will be decreasing a lot. Homosexuals can choose less risky sexual behaviors, such as oral sex that is much safe, rather than anal sex that has high risk of HIV transmission. What's more, using consistent condom is 76% effective in preventing new HIV infections. As a result, if the homosexuals take appropriate prevention measures, the risk will be significantly reduced and even as the as the straights. 
Secondly, homosexual do not have chance to choose their orientations because they are inborn. Based on what <name> said, homosexual is resulted by biological factors, such as hormones and genes. Their genes determine their sexual orientations. Homosexual is born not made. Once they were born in gay, they almost always remain homosexuals. If you are a heterosexual it is impossible for you to fall in love with same-sex person since your sexual orientation. If someone compels you to do so, how is your feeling in transpositional consideration? Similarly, homosexual will get the same painful feeling if they have to get married with opposite-sex persons. In addition, the part of environment factors does not matter in sexual orientation determination because there is no stable statistics being found to show the relationship between homosexuality and environments. It's hard and rare to change their sexual orientation as they growing up. Thus, homosexual is not a sin. People should not condemn them. 
Lastly, if people do not accept them and consider that homosexuals are monsters, it would cause many tragedies of society. The first family problem is "xinghun", which means ritual marriage reported in China's gay fake marriage (Joanna Chiu, 2013). Because of cultural background, the generality tends to be conservatism in the Eastern traditions compared with Western culture. Consequently, it is difficult for parents to accept the truth that their children are homosexuals. Some homosexuals will marriage with lesbians to cheat their parents but they live apart with their spouses. What is more, many homosexuals who although were not attracted by opposite sex at all, they chose to get married and have kids only because they were afraid of disappointing their parents. Both of these behaviors lead them to live in misery. In case their parents eventually find the fact, they may be more disappointed, aren't they? The second one is that the insights from others will cause some young homosexuals who are still in school to suicide. The rate of committing to suicide for homosexual teens is five times more than heterosexual teens. The incident of Tyler Clementi is a case in point. Tyler's roommate installed a webcam on Tyler's computer and spied on Tyler. His roommate found that Clementi kissed with his male partner and posted text to state that Tyler is a gay on the Internet. Finally, Tyler Clementi jumped into George Washington river to death due to this malicious bullying. Besides the instance of Tyler, many other homosexual teens are tempted in school. A lot of suicide incidents of homosexual teens are reported because people around them do not accept them and think that they are heterodox. This argument around homosexual teens gives them stress and influences their mental health. They commit to suicide due to their failure to resist police pressures. 
All in all, homosexuals are as the same as anyone who is living in this planet. They are not different. If they take proper measures to protect themselves when they have sex, it hardly infected by their partners who are the carries of SIDs or HIV. Homosexual is innocent for their sexual orientation since they are inborn. It is offered by nature and God. They do not have to change because you cannot ask someone normal who is sinless and does not make any mistakes to change something. It is a unfair treatment for them. For the sake of avoiding the tragedies of life like Tyler Clementi, people should be considerate to homosexuals. Even if you still cannot accept them for some reasons, please do not sneer at their sexual orientations. Conclusively, people should understand and respect the homosexuals, not being anti-homosexuals.
