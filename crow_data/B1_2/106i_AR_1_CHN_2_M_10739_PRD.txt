Target audience of Chinese animation 
Japanese anime is well-known all over the world these years, while Chinese animation cannot perform very well. In previous research, I have gain lots of useful information on this topic. Therefore, I find a method which may improve Chinese animation. I suggest Chinese animation expand its target audience to a wide range. 
The first reason is that young children cannot really afford the cost of making a good anime. This idea shows in my interview. Mr. <name> showed his opinion in the interview: "Japanese anime targets start from school children all the way to junior high, senior high and even more mature people such as college students or 30-40-year old man. On the other hand Chinese animation is more immature than Japanese anime." Then he added: "The financial cost (of making anime) as far as I heard were about 2 million dollars for a 24-episode anime with half year cycle." From his statement, it is not hard for me to figure out that making an anime cost a lot of money. Therefore I don't believe a huge amount of teenagers have such a lot of money and will pay for the expensive animation. Therefore, 15-year-old to 25-year-old people should be the target audience. 
The second reason is that if the anime studio focus on young children, they already block potential audience. In the book, the author of Chinese Animation: A History and Filmography 1922-20121, the author Rolf Giesen talked about the target audience:" One of Chinese officials said Chinese animations should target on young children. Then government helped domestic company by keeping the high license fees from foreign studio." From his belief, Chinese animation did block a lot of potential audience. Actually, I have many friends who love watching Japanese anime but Chinese animation. In their mind, they think Chinese animations are too na ve and immature to watch. 
My last reason is that young children in China don't have time to watch anime. In China, from primary school even before all the way to the end of their senior high school, students have to take exam-oriented education. Not like U.S, China has 1. 357 billion citizen and almost all youth need to take exams to the higher education. After they enter the college, however, they have lots of time to relax. As far as I heard, many college students in China don't have to attend their class and what they need is study a whole week for their final exam. So in China, Chinese animation should not limit the target audience on children, they can probably expand it to college students. 
In fact, many people have their own opinion against me. Some says that China did succeed in the earlier 20 century and the target audience is only children so why they have to change. However, the thing is as simply as their thought. China did succeed in the last century, but it was based on the government's help. China kept high license fees from foreign during that period and the government use a lot of money on animation without too much return. In addition, the internet is not very popular in the last century. Nowadays, it is easy for us to find interesting animation instead of limit bored animation. Other people are opposed to my opinion. They believe that children's parents will afford the cost of anime. Indeed, I know many children whose parents are pleasure to buy DVD even Blue-ray disc for them just like my mother. However, based on my observation, rarely parents will buy the genuine DVD instead of pirate DVD in China. Many of DVD sells in China is faker which is just copy through illegal way. In this situation, the studio cannot get money from their audience, however Piracy businesses will. 
In conclusion, I suggest Chinese animation expand their target audience to teenagers. Because the time has changed and their opponents had changed and already succeed.
