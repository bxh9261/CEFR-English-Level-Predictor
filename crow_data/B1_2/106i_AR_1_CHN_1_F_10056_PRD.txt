Dream function and dream interpretation method 
	Have you ever memorized your dream? Do you feel curios about those illogical but fantasy stories happened in your dream? Have you ever think of why it would appear like that? Since ancient time, people began to explain their dream by some religious method, considering them as some prophesy or warning. Psychologists have been arguing for the dream interpretation theories for many years. Even now they do not figure out a comprehensively scientific theory to convince all. The theory of Sigmund Freud who is the great psychologist spending his whole life working on dream interpretation has been accepted by most of current psychology society. I am totally agreed with the point that we can interpret our dream by relating it to our real experience and future expectation. Knowing the dream function and what it provides to our life is a way to better understand us and adjust our inner mood. 
- clearly state the Freudian dream theory 
- set the opposite opinions (Jung's theory, the theory of electrophysiological studies 
- tried to provide Freudian theory is better in dream interpretation and describe why it is currently accept by most part of psychology society 
- relate the dream function to our real life: what it does for us? What is the meaning of dream interpretation?
