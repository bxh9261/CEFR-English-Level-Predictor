Online shopping and logistics 
Online shopping is playing a more and more important role in people's daily lives. With the development of online shopping, logistics industry has boosted a lot. The whole process of online shopping needs the cooperation of these two industries. Online shopping not only boosts the logistics industry, but also provides many benefits for people. From my perspective, companies should not build or rent retail stores. It is better for them to improve their online shopping service, and make online shopping replace real malls. 
Online shopping can stimulate the countries' economic development, especially the logistics industry. Firstly, according to a survey1, the total transaction fund in China on 11th November was 5. 75 billion in 2013, but in 2014, it was about 57. 1 billion. These figures clearly show that online shopping increases the volume of logistics industry. Furthermore, online shopping provides people with different diplomas. In this modern city, the competition for graduated students is very severe. Many of them are unemployed, even if they have a very high education level. However, everyone can be an online shop owner with or without a diploma. Only the quality of goods and services provided by online shop owners are concerns of online shoppers. Also, as stated before, with the expansion of logistics industry, the employment has raised a lot. E-commerce and logistics also provide various positions for people with different diplomas. 
The last thing I want to point out is that online shopping has many advantages that real malls do not have. Online shopping makes it easier and more convenient for online shoppers to purchase all kinds of things around the world. By clicking keyboards at home, shoppers can get commodities within few days via delivery companies. Also, online shopping websites always provide reviews from former purchasers, so the shoppers can compare the qualities of goods. Moreover, coupons are given to the old costumers. So the more customers buy on the same website, the more they will save. 
Some people believe that online shopping cannot replace real malls, because they think they may get fake goods. I worried about this before, however, the policies of the online shopping websites make me completely trust the quality of their goods. For example, amazon provides free return and free shipping to costumers. If costumers receive goods that they do not like, they can return it without any fees. Also, all online shop owners must provide their own ID cards and identities to have their shops- they are bounded by laws. Some people also say that in poor areas the economies are not so developed that people there do not have access to the Internet. However, society and technology are changing, network coverage areas are becoming larger. So, I believe in the near future, the economies in the poor areas will be much more developed than today, and people there will all be able to shop online. 
In conclusion, I believe that online shopping will finally take the place of real shopping malls. The land used for shopping malls now will be used for the infrastructure constructions. Although there are defects of my opinions, I think the advantages of online shopping will overshadow the disadvantages, and online shopping will be the mainstream trend.
