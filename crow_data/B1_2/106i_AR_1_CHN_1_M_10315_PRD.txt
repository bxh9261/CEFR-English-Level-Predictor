Introduction 
	In China, there is a policy called single child policy-which means each family can have only one child. This policy effectively helps to control the population of China, but solutions that come with one child policy accompany problems. For instance, this policy does not consider how it influences the future mental health of an only-child. I was born in a single child family. My parents were always too busy to take care of me. 
what are the positive and negative effect of growing as an only child 
	One obvious phenomenon is that, many only-children don't have any accompany. Once their parents go to work, they become alone. Play by themselves, eat by themselves, do homework by themselves everything they have to do on their own. They are really lonely during their childhood, but it also develops their independence. After they get into college, they don't have to worry about living. They are able to take care of themselves. Some special situation is that because the kid is the only child in this family, parents give everything their child want, and do whatever their kid want. Kid is too dependent to do anything individually. All of these situations are so extreme that some of single children have totally different personality and behavior with kids who have sibling. For example, some of them don't like doing homework and always get distracted, or they can't organize their daily life well, and they normally don't attend group activity. 
Does only child have higher risk on developing ADHD?
