"Outsourcing - A Grandeur Illusion 
	The argument presented in the favor of outsourcing is, that it provides the country with jobs and brings India closer to the world. It has helped India create more jobs in the IT sector and uplifted the economic status of the country. Some folks might also argue that, it has uplifted the educational quality of the country; but all of this is only partially correct. The whole picture shows a completely different aspect of outsourcing, which is hidden from the common people because they only think about themselves, and how to be a better opportunist. The fact is, unemployment rate is increasing every year Times of India, number of unemployed people are always at least more than 100 times than the number of employed people in the service sector, as it can be clearly seen in the chart above, the unemployment rate has gone up in the past couple of decades from 7. 32 to 9. 4 in 2010 Trading Economics. Social and moral value are almost lost from the Youth of the Nation. Indians are loosing identity as Indians and that is a matter of deep concern. 
	Due to a sudden rise in the jobs at the IT sector, the workforce has shift towards it, and has given many false hope of getting job in the IT sector with just a Bachelor's degree, says Kar in his article The Flipside of Outsourcing in India2005. India's population density is nine times that of United States, but the growing youth doesn't realize that and wants to live the life of a Westerner - 2 cars, a big home, a family, central conditioned home, all the latest gizmo. There are certain barriers to this dream, although the gizmos are now achievable, due to cheaper electronics, others cannot be achieved because an average Indian can only enjoy 2500 square feet of space back and front yard included, which is very common in suburbia in a Western country para 10. He even pointed out that this doesn't only affect the hopes and dreams of the youth and the working class, but also depletes the resources of the country at an enormous rate, such as Clean Water and energy consumption. India is already dealing with high amounts of pollution, with the rising of the income of the middle class, everyone wants to grow and get a bigger home, better car, more luxurious life style, without the considering the declining physical state of the country para 12 
	According to an article by Ghimire, in peoi.org - Social Impact of Outsourcing, that covered an interview with a customer service representative at a call center, in India, revealed how these odd working hours are a projection of the desperation of jobs and how people are willing to work at such low wages at such odd hours affects their lives drastically. Depleting them of any social life, leaving them with no to very little time to work on themselves or even to meet with their families, on occasions because, what might be a holiday in India, its not a holiday in the United States para10. Due to a high supply of human resources, and the less willingness to pay a lot for the job, the amount paid to these call center representative is very low and there are no unions to keep a check on them; making the lives of these youngsters unpleasant para3. 
	Some of the ways these problems could be taken care of by realizing that India is not The United States. If Indians want to do things in the Western way, there has to be checks on and bounds by the government to prevent the depletion of the resources of the country at the rate that it cannot be replenished. Government can make sure that no household is using more than a certain KWh of electricity on a monthly basis. The solution also includes the companies trying to use the resources of the country - human and physical alike, to realize that exploitation will only be helpful in the short run. In a broader picture, there will come a time, when India will not be able to provide for outsourcing and that would affect the companies more drastically that the inflation in 2008. The UN should come into play and make sure the Outsourced countries are not being ripped off of their identity by the outsourcing countries. The government of the outsourced country should also think about the people not just about representing the country in a lime light while keeping it hollow from inside. The outsourcing companies/countries could also help by not pushing the employees to become more Western every chance they get.

Independent Travel 
Most people suffer a lot of stress from work and study in their daily lives. Hence, most of them have the tendency to pursue freedom and get rid of the troubles to let their body and mind have a rest. There are several ways for people to release pressure and get relaxed, and independent travel seems like a good way which can satisfy people's needs. Therefore, people should choose independent travel to release pressure and improve their lives. 
One of the reasons why independent travel is a suitable way to help people is that it brings a lot of excitement to people's daily lives. Most people might have the feeling of unfulfilled and disappointed toward their lives, since they do almost the same work and repeat it day by day. What they need now is something different to color their lives. Independent travel, a type of travel which requires people to plan the schedule all by themselves and deal with all kinds of things they meet during travel, is an effective way to satisfy people's needs. Tsaur, S., Yen, C., & Chen, C defined knowledge constructs on the article ""Independent tourist knowledge and skills"" into three parts: onsite travel capability, pre-trip preparation, and emergency response(Tsaur, S., Yen, C., & Chen, C., 2010, p. 1053) It's definitely not an easy work, however, this is exactly why it is excited. Stay in another country, people would enjoy the different culture and concentrate on those unfamiliar and interesting things. Besides, exploring the unknown world and having an adventure can stimulate people's curiosity and thus could help them forget the unhappy things and troubles for the moment. It might help to get depressed mood release during travel and leave people feeling light and relaxed unconsciously. Travel puts some unexpectedness, what was lacking and missing in most people's lives today. Unexpected things made them feel exciting and interesting. During travel, people not only release their pressure and stress, but also it fills the voids of people's boring daily lives. Therefore, independent travel seems like the best way for people to improve their lives. 
Sitting on chairs and working with computers on the office from day to night would damage people's health both mentally and physically. Working long time with computers might impair people's eyesights, also, computer radiation is harmful for healths. It would be better if people can go outside and enjoy the beauty of nature, take a breath of fresh air, to stretch, to get natural light into their computer-strained eyes. Besides, busy on handling with a lot of works and dealing with all kinds of personal relationships makes them suffer a lot pressure. Travel independently, people are free to do anything they want without considering others. So they can put all the things, all the troubles from work or study behind them, and focus on the nature, the beauty of world. Doing some outside exercise such as hiking could make their weak arms and legs get stronger, and people's minds would be purified deeply by enjoying the power of nature. Travel requires people to keep walking, keep accepting new things and keep acquiring knowledge at the same time, but people will not feel boring at all, since all the things around them are attractive enough to make them forget the tiredness. It is a way that could make people easy to accept and help them unconsciously without any pain.

"Cybersecurity: Savior of the Internet 
From my curious thoughts to the synthesizing of multiple research papers, my ideas and pictures in how cybersecurity affect the system have been continuously changing. My awareness has been raised to the level that every time I open a website and start browsing, I have to check the information provided by the Symantec Norton Internet Antivirus, an antivirus tool that I installed in my computer. According to International Telecommunication Union, cybersecurity is defined as the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, best practices and insurance that can be used to protect cyber environment (International Telecommunication Union, 2014). In a more understandable term, imagine yourself driving a car. When there is a car accident, your airbag in front of you provides you with the first protection that you can ever get, similar to what the protection cybersecurity can provide in the virtual world. As you can see, it provides us with a layer of protection that can lessen threats that may have gotten to us directly. Therefore, in this paper, I am going to argue that all Internet users should be concerning about cybersecurity. 
Cybersecurity was created to safeguard our increasingly sophisticated technological world. According to Joel Brenner, an NSA counsel, ""The Internet wasn't built for security, yet we have made it the backbone of virtually all private-sector and government operations, as well as communications"" (Estes, 2014). Furthermore, David Nall, a programmer at NASA regarded his opinion that, more things connected to the internet means more vulnerabilities (Estes, 2014). Nowadays, many public services such as economic transactions, air traffic control and even the power grid are all connected to the internet. Additionally, our daily public transportation will also be connected to and controlled by the internet as well in the future (Estes, 2014). Obviously, all of these things are playing big roles in our daily lives, and without cybersecurity in place, imagine what it will be like if these things are hacked and controlled by hackers. They could possibly control everything that is connected to internet without even seeing those things. In retrospect, the internet serves as a public virtual space for everyone. Anyone could use this space to create or do whatever they want. However, having a protection from cybersecurity could grant one a layer of privacy, blocking any harmful threats that might harm one's information. With this regard, cybersecurity is therefore a guardian of users' virtual spaces. 
The uncertainty of what could happen in the internet is, undeniably scary. Because of the fact that, all information on or connected to the internet could be taken without our permission by an anonymous hacker if left unprotected. Therefore, the responsibility of practicing cybersecurity falls into the hand of every internet user, from individuals to organizations, and to even nations. Starting from individuals, it wouldn't be surprise that hacking into people's private messages has become increasingly frequent during these past couple years (Wolfe, 2012). Thereby, the world's first ""cyber-bodyguard"" developed by a company named Vigilante Bespoke, was established. This company provides a protection to the users that seek a high level of privacy. Nonetheless, issues regarding IT crime are also rising as well in organizations. The booming of technological industries during the past decades has made cybersecurity in mobiles and tablets becoming more important than ever. Nowadays, industries have to face with complexities of new security challenges while making new products for new customers. They have to deal with many advanced hacking methods that could harm their company every single day. Therefore, it is no one, but company itself to be responsible for its security. With this regard, the biggest challenge that everyone should be concerning about is his or her own nation's security. As technology is continuously changing, achieving the most durable protection over the whole country or even the world requires the effort from various public/private sectors (Asllani, A., White, C. S., & Ettkin, L, 2013). It isn't only government's responsibility to protect their nations, but it is everyone, every single individuals and organizations. 
Being responsible for our own protection is a main concept of cybersecurity. However, if one fails to protect his or her self, the consequence could be disastrous. Consider the case of the recent i Cloud hacks that happened last summer. Twenty-six celebrities were the victims of this hack. The hackers somehow managed to get into the i Cloud accounts of celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Victoria Justice and many others (Remling, 2014). This hack proves that even a well-protected and advanced company such as Apple can get hacked too. Therefore, the responsibility of protecting our own data didn't fall into the company's hand, but ourselves, the users. Similar cases could also be seen in various organizations. Nowadays, most business companies have changed their economic system to be internet-based. However, making this change also provides side effects (NY times, 2014). Companies such as Wal-Mart, Home-Depot, Target, and Apple have all recently been targets of cyber-attacks (Fortune, 2014). Due to the fact that all of these companies are global-scaled, hackers could, therefore, plunder even more revenue and money from the companies, and moreover caused them to lose their brands' reputation. Even the highly branded bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank, was breached last summer (NY times, 2014). This attack compromised over 76 million households' accounts and seven million small businesses, possibly the biggest cyber-attacks in the corporate history. Edward J. Markey, a member of Senate Commerce Committee, also exemplified the bank data breach as another danger in Americans' most sensitive personal information. All in all, the result, whether it happened in individuals or any business companies, was crucially disastrous. Such things wouldn't have happened if these people and companies had their awareness of cybersecurity. 
In general, issues regarding cybersecurity are on the rise. Our world is becoming more globalized and connected. Even though, this provides various benefits for us, it also brings lots of headaches and losses for the users too. As things get more connected and integrated into the internet, achieving complete control with the mean of exploiting bugs and vulnerabilities is becoming more common in this age of technology. According to these trends, I foresee the future of cyberspace as a virtual reality, a world that is going to be built upon on the internet, a world that humans will depend on. Think of the threats that might happen to us in the future, it won't be the same anymore. Crimes in the future will be targeted things that are online, and being unprotected isn't going to work out too well. Thereby, having a protection from cybersecurity, in my opinion, is our first leading step to the future.

Long Argument

To Stretch or not to stretch
Muscle has been known for a long time as the object that applies force and as it increases in size develops more strength. It also aids in everyday activities such as walking, running and your daily thirty minute routines. As an athlete, muscle is a main player in the optimal performance and outcome of whatever event is trying to be accomplished. Physiological features of muscle are striations, white or red color depending on the oxygen present, pennate shape and it contracts by a neurotransmitter called Acetylcholine. Muscle is always in a state of partial contraction and it is ready to go when calcium binds and attaches the myosin heads. The contraction occurs as soon as myosin binds. Figure 1. 1 shows how myosin heads bind to actin and how the muscle contracts. In various workouts and exercise routines muscle is contracted, extended and pulled in various manners. The muscle contracts based on the exercise or how large or small the motor unit is. The motor unit is how many neuronal endings dive into how many muscle cells. If they innervate many muscle cells (myocytes) then something like the quadriceps would contract. If it only innervates a few then it would be a small contraction in the index finger. For athletes workout routines can work either with eccentric or concentric exercise. Eccentric means that the muscle extends past the normal angle, it extends beyond that. Concentric means to decrease the angle of the muscle or shorten the muscle. However, both workouts help soreness to arrive in your muscle. But the greater question is how to decrease the soreness and get optimal performance out of your body. Over a period of time lactic acid has always been the assumed cause of soreness in the muscle. Now studies show that there are more factors that play into the diagnosis. Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness has become the chosen way to diagnose the pain that trembles with the muscles after a workout and coincides over time.
Lactic Acid for a long period of time has always been the culprit for muscle soreness. Muscle would normally get sore after a long workout and it got even more intense the day after. The main idea was that glycogen was pulled from the cytoplasm of muscle cell and broken down to get a net yield of two ATP. ATP is utilized in various stages of muscle contraction. The net yield of two ATP then turned into lactic acid. This process explained above all happens through anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic means that oxygen isn't present and when oxygen isn't present the ATP then gets fermented into lactic acid. In the article Putting Muscles to the Acid Test it states, ""For decades, physiologist ascribed muscle fatigue to something else, the buildup of lactic acid"" (Profitt 1). Physiologists have been studying muscle over time on just the argument about lactic acid. There are some ideas that have come up that lactic acid is the soreness during the workout (Hanc 1). That would make sense if it is applied to modern chemistry because lactic acid as stated in the name of it is acid. When acid is applied to anything it would have a burning effect. This is not the only experiment that has been done from the founding idea of lactic acid.
In an experiment the plantar flexor motion was tested. This experiment's overall goal or outcome was to see how a muscle being stretched downward and planted would affect the muscle. Riesman decided to test individuals who were maintained a sedentary life style and compared them to athletes who were active. He took specific muscle like the Fibularis Longus and tested how that muscle reacted from a resting state to an active state. Reisman figured out which muscle had a higher reaction rate when it came to the eccentric muscle contraction. Then once the muscle was contracted he measures the soreness in the muscle. He took that sore muscle and tried to stretch each. The overall idea was to disprove or approve whether stretching actually benefitted athletes. They used both extremes to see which end product would produce an increase in soreness. In the journal titled Changes in passive tension after stretch of unexercised and eccentrically exercised human plantar flexor muscle, it states "" It has been shown that muscle stiffness levels are a predictor of the amount of muscle damage from eccentric exercise""(Reisman 1). An example of an eccentric workout is running down a hill. The soreness may not be felt while running down hill, but when running up the pain is felt. The next morning that soreness correlates with the extension of legs from the striding down the hill. In this experiment the individuals that were sedentary reported ""immediately after the stretch passive torque values were lower at all angles, the differences becoming more prominent at longer lengths where torque levels were higher"" (Reisman 549). From this quote it shows that people that don't work out on a regular basis fatigue a lot quicker than individuals who have built up a tolerance to that stretch within the muscle. Also it states that ""after the stretch muscle soreness has fallen significantly"" (Reisman 550). These individuals benefitted more from stretching after the exercise than in the beginning depending on what exercise was done. If the exercise tore muscle then it is not a smart idea. Reiseman proves that as he states "" it should be remembered, though, that the act of carrying out the stretch will by itself be painful for the subject and if any eccentric damage is present, risks exacerbating the damage""( Reisman 553). Precautions need to be looked at before continuing to stretch the muscle after it has harm that has been done to it because it injury will only increase. Eccentric exercises have a large impact on muscle soreness, but in athletes the problem perpetuates.
Athletes in various sports perform an abundance of different types of exercises. These exercises are aimed to amplify certain muscle groups to perform activates. For athletes that participate in sports such as soccer, basketball and track, they need to use their fast twitch type two muscle fibers. These fibers are specific to anaerobic activities such as fast sprints up and down the field/court. These muscle fibers are normally white because of the lack of oxygen present and they have a larger diameter which results in increased exerted force. For athletes that participate in marathons and long distance running they will have an abundance of type 1 slow twitch fibers. These fibers will be red because of the presence of lots of oxygen. Oxygen is of high importance and in high demand for runners that need to fuel their lungs with oxygen in order to keep breathing. They will also have more endurance and less power output. In either anaerobic or aerobic activities coaches can harm or strengthen the muscles of the athletes they are training.
Coaches try and train their athletes to reach the maximum performance; however the exercise that they are giving them they have not studied the affect that it takes on the athletes' body. They are in the same boat with everyone else that has been taught that lactic acid causes the soreness. Most coaches are prescribing stretching to take care of the soreness; however in eccentric workouts as stated before, it harms the inflamed muscle even more. This is just the tip of the ice berg of concerns when it comes to coaching techniques.
Coaches, even on the professional level are starting to figure out how to treat their athletes and to prescribe them to see the right professionals. For example, ""On Monday's during the season, Mr. Tomlinson spends much of the day with Mr. Durkin trying to minimize soreness, reduce inflammation and speed what Mr. Durkin calls 'the regeneration process' (Hanc 1). Pro-athletes such as La Dainian Tomlinson, who plays for the San Diego Chargers is trying to recover in order to prepare him for the next game. His coach wants the maximum performance out of him. However, the greater question is what techniques does he use to get the soreness out of his muscles? The doctors state ""When you increase your workload, you should be doing it gradually"" (Hanc 2). There is a ten percent rule that most physiologist use so that they don't overwork the patient or individual. There are three areas in which the ten percent rule applies. The frequency is defined as how often you do the exercise. The intensity is how much hard and fast the individual is being pushed during the exercise. The duration is defined by how long the exercise is lasting. The exercises can be short and repetitive or rather they are there to test the endurance of the individual. The 10 percent rule has been put into place as a precautionary matter so that not just the muscle in the body, but your body as a unit handles all that it can without harming parts of it. It is used over a long period of time to help the individual get back up to maximum performance. In order to get up to the maximum performance they work with one area a week. So for example with coaches and the training modalities that they use, if they were having athletes life weights then they should only increase the weights by 10 percent. An example of that would be bicep curls. If individuals start out with lifting fifty pounds, they should only increase by 5 pounds when they meet that next step in their training. This ten percent rule is there as a tool to help the athlete or individual back up to their full potential and functional to work out again. If lactic acid as is not the cause of muscle soreness then there has to be another explanation, another reason why our bodies ache the next day.
The new idea that has come about over the years after experimenting with lactic acid is Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. It is used by most physicians and physiologist to make diagnoses. Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is the idea that the soreness, pain and ""Eccentric activities induce micro-injury at a greater frequency and severity than other types of muscle actions"" (Cheung 145). From this it can be inferred that DOMS is a diagnosis that encompasses the larger picture and looks at more than just the soreness in the muscles. Physicians look at the amount of oxygen present, the intensity of the workout, the area in which the pain is coming from, the severity of the muscle tear and then from that data, makes a diagnosis to target the largest problem with that injury. Once the largest part the injury is dealt with the smaller areas can be looked at and diagnosed from there. When athletes are not active or participating in an event over time, when they jump back into the activity it is bothersome to the body (Cheung 145). This time gap can make the diagnosis larger and more time consuming to heal.
The more time that is needed for these micro tears to heal can come in various assortments. These injuries have been put to the test in an experiment. The ""examples of impairment included a decreased range of motion, decreased strength or abnormal electromyographical patterns"" (Cheung 150). If these functions are messed with then the rest of the body as a whole is going to have to compensate and keep the body functioning. For an athlete who participates in soccer, if their range of motion is messed with then they will not have a full extension of their lower leg to kick the ball. For someone who participates in weight lifting the decreased strength will set them back in their workout. These are just a few examples of effects that Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness causes. However, the effects of delayed onset muscle soreness have been experimented with in individuals who are healthy and active constantly.
In this experiment there were two individuals who were male and they kept a constant active lifestyle. These guys were tested in two different conditions. They were tested in on a flat surface and on an incline and timed for a thirty minute period on each. The main focus of this test was to see how their muscles fatigue and what happened with the oxygen (ROS) and how much creatine was present. Creatine phosphate would be present in your muscle if it was between 1-10 seconds of a workout of the muscle. The way the experimenters figure out how much oxygen was present and creatine phosphate was to draw blood. Since this is a test under the category on Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, the testing would have to be done after 24 hours. As stated ""It usually peaks at 24-72 hours and disappears within 7 days after exercise"" (Taguchi 1). It can take people up to 24 to at least feel any reaction within the muscles. In this experiment it was shown that ""Increasesd DOMS and loss of muscle function were observed following DWN (P<0.05) but not following DWN (P>0.05)"" (Close 1). This quote backs the idea that when muscles are going through an eccentric workout such as running down the hill, that they are getting harmed and not benefitting from it. It also was found that ""There was a significant difference in serum creatine kinase (CK) activity between the two conditions (P<0.05) with CK activity being significantly elevated following DWN (P<0.05)"" (Close 3). The blood levels were increased with creatine phosphate in the guys that ran down the hill. Through all of this data that has been collected in this experiment Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is shown to occur more often in eccentric exercises and has become the main diagnosis tool for muscles. This experiment shows that experiments are being done from all angles and the conclusions are coming out more precise. In comparison to Lactic Acid, DOMS has more information to back the diagnoses that are being made and help the athlete as a whole to fully recover. In order for an athlete to fully recover, there are constant routines and exercises that need to take place in order to get individuals back on their feet and rocking.
For individuals who are not athletes and participate in activities on a daily basis the body responds in a different manner. Delayed onset muscle soreness has a similar effect in individuals who workout for stress purposes or just for fun. In people who work out for fun have parallel effects to athletes, that hold them back from having the optimal range of motion or maximum force put out. Athletes just need a quicker recovery time. The Federation of Sports Medicine says ""Moreover, eccentric training may be advantageous to younger populations interested in improving muscle strength, as well as physically limited populations hoping to gain improvements in muscle strength and function at lower cardiac stress and perceived exertion levels"" (Dannecker 6). From this statement sports medicine clinicians have found out that individuals who take care of the Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness ahead of time will have a better outcome in the end. Also, just as most statistics say that younger people have an easier time recovering because their bodies are so agile. The recovery of muscles though doesn't happen without the individual internally wanting to improve themselves. The body will tell you that it is sore through muscle pains and aches. The muscle soreness is a sign that the issues needs to be dealt with. For the optimal strength to be gained back again it is more than just a physical battle. It is an internal battle from within to want to improve and fight through the pain. It is super apparent in individuals who are beginning to work out again to believe in themselves. For athletes it is fighting through the pain to beat the other team and last longer. It goes back to that saying that ""pain is weakness leaving the body."" There are lots of tools to handle the pain within the body that can be provided through a physician or physical exercises.
After a workout, most individuals' muscles have become sore because they have been used strenuously over a period of time. For athletes who have been in season for awhile it is just soreness from the workouts that they are participating in on a daily basis. These are pains show that muscles are being contracting and through that they are defining and becoming sufficiently stronger. For individuals who work out every once in awhile, they can expect to be sore because their body isn't physical used the amount of work put on them. For individuals who are either athletes or general people the best way to fix the micro tears are to use a variety of tools. ""In the meantime ice, stretch and perform light activity to help work the soreness from your muscles. Just be clear that it's not lactic acid you are working out. The soreness, Dr. Thomas Fahey of Chico said, 'is completely due to muscle injury and inflammation"" (Hanc 2). The muscles need to be ice in order to decrease the toxicity in the muscle and shorten the muscles so that no more tearing occurs. Stretching as stated before in the paper is good before workouts, but not good for torn muscle. For athletes that are professional, they use cool downs to slowly relax the muscle and to get the muscle use to all this work put on it. Also, ""To do so, more ice will be applied, and Mr. Tomlinson gets 60 minutes of deep massage and body work"" (Hanc 2). Even professional athletes uses resources like massage therapy to rub out the soreness and inflammation in the muscle to get their body back to top performance. These exercises may take some time to start the healing process of muscles, however it has been found to be the best source for recuperation.
Lactic Acid has been the rumor that has stood the test of time as the excuse to why muscles are sore after exercising. However, scientist and physiologist have come up with a new explanation that is moving forward with science. Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness has taken the individual diagnosis of the lactic acid build up (Hydrogen ions) in muscle during the workout and the immediate pain from that and tied together various symptoms to diagnose the patient. The soreness does not come from one cause it comes from various source like micro tears, inflammation and most common from eccentric workouts. Eccentric workouts, for example like running down a hill, have physically felt easier to the body while doing it. However, when individuals whether athletes or people who exercise for fun, wake up the next morning and have pain in those muscles it is because they got the most work out of the muscles contracted during the eccentric workout. The muscles show a sign 24-48 hrs later and the pain can last up to a week. For people who need to function on a daily basis this becomes an issue. Athletes need to get back to the workouts before their big events and individuals need to function without feeling pain wherever they go. Delayed onset muscle soreness it taken care and brought back to normal through massage therapy, stretching and cool downs. Coaches and physiologist use both in the clinical setting and the sports environment to gets muscles back to normal. There is no longer an argument into what causes muscle soreness. The diagnosis has been given and it is Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.

Argumentative Paper 
Can we depend on the robots in the future? 
	Nowadays, robots are getting more and more popular and advanced in people's life thanks to the development of technology and engineering. They can cope with a lot of things for us, such as manufacturing and serving. Therefore humans depend on them much more than before. But some people say that robots have many disadvantages, because they are not able to understand us thoroughly and they make mistakes. In my opinion, in the future robots will be our companions and they could lead us to a better future. Because they have the efficiency and the unique abilities that we don't have. In this way, they could help us in our life, work, and academics. 
	First of all, I believe that robots are helping us in many ways and making our life more efficient. For example, Kuka robots, the leader of the car manufactory robots company, they made their robots in very high accuracy and efficiency. Those robots are especially made for making cars and there are many types of robots which are capable of different tasks. Some of them are able to make doors and some of them are made to assembly the car body. In this way, they can share the burden of the workers and make the whole process faster and cheaper. It follows that companies could spend less and produce more, and people can save a lot of money. In a word, robots are good helpers, because they could work more efficient and more accurate than humans, and they never feel tired. 
	However, there are still some people think that robots are actually hazardous rather helpful. They firstly argue that robots sometimes make mistakes which are lethal. For example, the Volkswagen factory in Germany had a very terrible accident just a few months ago. The assembly robot accidently took a human worker into the assembly line and killed him. This news did shock everyone and people started worry about the safety of those robots. Nevertheless, this is avoidable. If engineers could refine the robots to lower the risk to the least, we could still trust the robot. And everyone make mistakes, robots are not the exception. Secondly, some individuals hold the opinion that one day in the future, robots may be so clever and so advanced, that they may dominate the world. Since in the future robots could be added the function that they can learn by themselves and they may have their own thoughts. This is reasonable in some perspective. But we can prevent it, because robots are made by us. We can programme them into what we like and nip it in the bud. 
	In conclusion, although there are some problems robots have, we can solve them by developing our technology and programming. And in the future, the robot will have more benefits than its drawbacks. Since in the future, robots not only could make our life easier and more efficient, but also they could help us to explore the new science areas. I strongly believe that they will be human's guiders and companion to lead us to a better future.

Supply Chains Benefit Manufacturers, Companies, and Customers 
	Many people confuse the term logistics and supply chains, logistic is a distribution process within the company, while supply chains include multiple companies, manufacturers, and customers. With the increasing competition within the market, manufacturers look for the lowering costs, companies find ways to establish close contact with manufacturers, and customers pursue the best quality and price of products with better customer services. Because of above demands, manufactures and companies will continue innovate and reform the entire production and supply chain to maximize the profit. Customers will continue seek for best quality and best price that provides customer service to meet their satisfaction and needs. I totally embrace that the supply chain enhance manufactures, companies, and customers' profit at the same time. Their cooperation of three parties improve the overall efficiency. 
	For manufacturers, advanced supply chain provides several sustainable advantages including: lower production costs, introduce ""poll system"", and reduce inventory carrying costs to improve overall efficiency. The most direct method for manufacturers to stand out the market is to offer the lower price than average price. By shipping out finished goods directly to customers, manufacturers can provide a competitive price even lower than the average price. Compared with traditional logistic method, supply chain provides a newly ""poll system"" which can reduce a large amount of inventories carrying costs. <Name>, a Professor of Purdue University who teaches supply chain told us that manufacturers should not make products until customers place orders. With the help of poll system, different manufacturers get information immediately. Therefore, with the poll system, manufacturers can make their production schedule before they make products, which helps they make a plan on purchasing and production properly, which improve the overall efficiency. Professor Amy David provides me couple steps to control and to improve the efficiency of inventories, which lower their cost. First, manufacturers working closely with supplier, not only their communication, but their locations. Since the location of manufacturers and suppliers are close, in which largely reduce the lead time and save shipping fees. The short distance cut out transportation fees and helps them sell products quickly. Next, manufacturers reduce inventories carrying-costs and improve production efficiency by standardizing products and module designing. For example, Panda Express provides customers with different choices to meet different preference. By using ""poll system"", reducing inventory carrying cost and increasing production efficiency, manufacturers can use least cost to create the most profit by supply chain. 
	For companies, a positive purchasing plan, short lead-time, a better distribution center and a closely relationship with transportation can help company to improve the overall efficiency. Blanchard (2014) recognizes some elements that in response to the vigorous development of supply chains: stay positive with purchasing, reducing lead-times, control the distribution center smoothly, and developing the long-term relationships with transportation companies. To future to illustrate the supply chain strategies above, Badeshia (2014) concludes the four ways to improve companies' overall efficiency: companies operate different supply chains based on different situations, they should make a purchasing plan in the regular time interval, also let finance and logistics team work together to create a central supply chain organization. 
	Since customers have closer relationship with companies, they are beneficial from better prices and variety selections than before. On the one hand, companies have to satisfy customers due to a competitive market. Like what Blanchard (2014) says that in order to produce profit for both companies and customer parties in the next decade, companies need to pay more attention on customers. He emphasizes the success of Colgate. They meet individual customer with different kinds of requirements as much as possible. As a result, this process receive excellent feedbacks from customers and improve sales volume at the meantime. By improving customer satisfaction, customers get better service; with a large amount sales volume, companies also provide customers a lower prices. Therefore, with the huge contribution of companies, the biggest beneficiaries are customers due to lower price and better customer service. Customers are able to get different kinds of goods worldwide that they could not get previously. Take me as an example, I can get fresh foods all over the world every day, but if we did not have supply chain before, we only have limited selections such as soybeans and corns. 
	To sum up, manufacturers, companies, and customers stay in the chain supply, they take individual profit. Manufacturers increase production and reduce inventories carrying costs by using poll system; companies improve the sales volume; customers receive better price with best customer service. Supply chains serve all three parties on the same time, which promote optimum competition within the global market.

"Homosexual Argumentative Essay 
Purdue University 
(The First Draft) 
Homosexual Argumentative Essay 
Homosexual is a controversial topic so far. There are a lot of organization that favors advancing homosexuals rights. Similarly, we could hear some news about anti-gay parade from all around world. After I did lots of research about this topic and interviewed <name>, who is a Ph D majoring in Psychological Science, people should understand and respect the homosexuals, not being anti-homosexuals from my perspective. I will demonstrate my opinion in sight of health infection of homosexual, what influences homosexuals' sexual orientation and social problems caused by homosexual. 
First of all, the homosexuals are not promiscuous as people considering (<name> , personal communication, March, 2015.) Actually, they have the same sexual attitude with straight people. Of course, some may say the existence of homosexual would increase the rate of some disease infections according to some academic reports, which demonstrates homosexuals is a high-risk group of HIV and some other sexually transmitted diseases. However, the infections occurring is not because of their promiscuities but because of the way of intercourse of the homosexuals, which they have sex in anus. In addition, referring to CDC (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention), also shows that if homosexuals take protection when they have sex, the rate of being infected will be decreasing a lot. Homosexuals can choose less risky sexual behaviors, such as oral sex that is much safe, rather than anal sex that has high risk of HIV transmission. What's more, using consistent condom is 76% effective in preventing new HIV infections. As a result, if the homosexuals take appropriate prevention measures, the risk will be significantly reduced and even as the as the straights. 
Secondly, homosexual do not have chance to choose their orientations because they are inborn. Based on what <name> said, homosexual is resulted by biological factors, such as hormones and genes. Their genes determine their sexual orientations. Homosexual is born not made. Once they were born in gay, they almost always remain homosexuals. If you are a heterosexual it is impossible for you to fall in love with same-sex person since your sexual orientation. If someone compels you to do so, how is your feeling in transpositional consideration? Similarly, homosexual will get the same painful feeling if they have to get married with opposite-sex persons. In addition, the part of environment factors does not matter in sexual orientation determination because there is no stable statistics being found to show the relationship between homosexuality and environments. It's hard and rare to change their sexual orientation as they growing up. Thus, homosexual is not a sin. People should not condemn them. 
Lastly, if people do not accept them and consider that homosexuals are monsters, it would cause many tragedies of society. The first family problem is ""xinghun"", which means ritual marriage reported in China's gay fake marriage (Joanna Chiu, 2013). Because of cultural background, the generality tends to be conservatism in the Eastern traditions compared with Western culture. Consequently, it is difficult for parents to accept the truth that their children are homosexuals. Some homosexuals will marriage with lesbians to cheat their parents but they live apart with their spouses. What is more, many homosexuals who although were not attracted by opposite sex at all, they chose to get married and have kids only because they were afraid of disappointing their parents. Both of these behaviors lead them to live in misery. In case their parents eventually find the fact, they may be more disappointed, aren't they? The second one is that the insights from others will cause some young homosexuals who are still in school to suicide. The rate of committing to suicide for homosexual teens is five times more than heterosexual teens. The incident of Tyler Clementi is a case in point. Tyler's roommate installed a webcam on Tyler's computer and spied on Tyler. His roommate found that Clementi kissed with his male partner and posted text to state that Tyler is a gay on the Internet. Finally, Tyler Clementi jumped into George Washington river to death due to this malicious bullying. Besides the instance of Tyler, many other homosexual teens are tempted in school. A lot of suicide incidents of homosexual teens are reported because people around them do not accept them and think that they are heterodox. This argument around homosexual teens gives them stress and influences their mental health. They commit to suicide due to their failure to resist police pressures. 
All in all, homosexuals are as the same as anyone who is living in this planet. They are not different. If they take proper measures to protect themselves when they have sex, it hardly infected by their partners who are the carries of SIDs or HIV. Homosexual is innocent for their sexual orientation since they are inborn. It is offered by nature and God. They do not have to change because you cannot ask someone normal who is sinless and does not make any mistakes to change something. It is a unfair treatment for them. For the sake of avoiding the tragedies of life like Tyler Clementi, people should be considerate to homosexuals. Even if you still cannot accept them for some reasons, please do not sneer at their sexual orientations. Conclusively, people should understand and respect the homosexuals, not being anti-homosexuals.

Does the natural environment cause food differences between northern and southern China? 
	Food cultures are complex in different regions for each country. China, world's second-largest country by land area has a long history of diet cultures. The Yangtze River divides China into two main parts: North and South. Different locations, climates, and human history not only create the cultural difference between the North and South but also generate unique diet styles. And then a question arises in my mind: Does natural environment cause food differences between northern and southern China? At first, the geological difference gives rise to the diversity of the staple food. Subsequently, the wet climate in southern China encourages people to have spicier food. Finally, higher distribution of sugarcane cause the southern cuisine is sweeter than the northern one. 
	Secondly, chili pepper is a common plant in the natural environment. Also, it is a notable characteristic that southern food different than the northern one. Sichuan, a province in the south China, people in there love to put chili almost in every dish. Why do they love chili so much? It mostly relies on a humid sub-tropical monsoonal environment: mild winter, long frost-free period, hot summer, plentiful rainfall and mist in the southern China. The eastern basin area and lower western valleys mainly contributed in the southern part. The high precipitation and particular geographical figure make the water assemble in a ""natural bowl"". That's why climate in Sichuan is milder than plain as similar as the atmosphere in most of the southern part in China. And chili gives local people a good balance for them to adapt better this kind of natural environment. Then the question is coming: what is chili? Chili is extracted from a fruit of plants named chili pepper and broadly applied in the fields of food and medicine. And chili pepper is a small shrub with the woody stem and up to one-meter high. It is always picked up while green and then becomes red when it achieves completed maturity. When people eat chili, their heat sensation will be stimulated by capsaicin, which is odorless, colorless and oily chemical we usually find in chili pepper. Although there is no physical burning, capsaicin makes people feel an excessive amount of heat because the certain sensory neuron in human bodies bonds with the area that touched by chili. That will cause people sweating and releases excessive water in the body. The diseases such as arthritis and rheumatism that people in wet regions usually fall ill will be eased due to a daily diet of eating some food with chilipara.14. Nevertheless, the magazine ""Natural China"" claimed the opposite opinion: everyone has the different body conditions that depend on family hesitance, personal life and so on. And natural environment is just a small part. Therefore, people mostly will not prefer spicy food just depending on the natural environment Jan. 5, 2010. That was true. However, ""Natural China"" ignored the fact: there were only about 2 million people in northern China catch the illness that was caused by high humidity in bodies, but over 30 million people in the south contract this kind of illness. Obviously, in a wet environment, the biological requirement of people will encourage them to have more spicy food to eliminate excessive water in bodies. And that is the reason why the natural environment leads to the food difference. 
	Thirdly, sugarcane, as a part of the natural environment, is the prevalent resource of sugar in the south of China. And it is also an important factor that brings about the food difference. The sugarcane planting is most popular in three states of southern China: Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guangdong. These three places are always wet and higher temperature Luo, para.2. The winter from January to March is short but cold. The range of temperature is in the range of 37 to 46 Fahrenheit degree. On the other hand, the weather from April through September is the rainy season which temperature reaches the highest value. The range of temperature is in the range of 76 to 88 Fahrenheit degree. During the rainy season, rain continues for whole day long Chinahights.com. Compare with the growing environment of sugarcane, the southern China is one of the best places for sugarcane growing. claims that sugarcane is a tropical plant that grows in low sea level. It has a better adoption to grow in a wet environment whatever winter and summer. The temperature between 70-95 degrees Fahrenheit is best for growing sugarcane. That's the reason that sugarcane is popular in the south of China but scarce in the north. Ndoro, 2015. Nonetheless, Zhao, a sociology professor at Zhejiang University demonstrated a different opinion: B.C. 1352 year before Christ, China has the historical record of early business Nature China, 2011. As a common plant in the south, sugarcane was probably transported to from the south to the north in the past. So the people live in the northern region have sugar too. If sugar is popular in the south because sugarcane is ubiquitous in the south, sugar should also be popular in northern China. In contrast, the fact is opposite: sugar and sweet flavor are not that popular in the north. However, when business people send sugar to the north, cost of time, labor, and transportation made the price of sugar become very high. Even though sugar had been a good in early business, it was expensive so that most people in northern China could not purchase it for daily use just like they bought other condiments such as vinegar and salt. For this reason, sugar was not popular in northern China, but it formed sugar culture in the southern part. 
	In conclusion, the natural environment has a significant role in the formation of food difference in China. At first, the fact that the South people prefer to eat rice rather than the North people results in the greater production of rice depends on the geological difference in the natural environment. Secondly, wet climate is also a reason that why southern people used to like spicy food rather than the northern regions. Lastly, the southern cuisine is sweeter because of the higher distribution of sugarcane as well. Furthermore, as Mr. <name> told me in the interview: ""today, many people concerned about car, house, job, but not considered about food: the most fundamental thing for surviving. We spent over 2 hours per day on eating food to support daily activity. So why don't we pay more attention on the discover of food?""

Amplify the Voice of Anti-Bullying 
Bullying is constantly and increasingly threating the safety of our youths. Over the past 20 years, the dramatic expansion of electronic technology and increasing complexity of teenagers' emotion gave rise to new types and higher prevalence of school bullying. Sometimes, teasing and roughhousing are not just innocuous and na ve behaviors even if these happen to kids; generating health problems and emotional damages, destroying one's self-esteem and identity, bullying has devastating negative effects on victims, especially on adolescents. Therefore, I believe school, students, parents, and the community should work together to implement anti-bullying and intervention program. People should take actions to prevent bullying, recognize the signs, and respond appropriately. 
The first reason justifies the significance of provoking anti-bullying altogether is that teen bullying will not only affect our youths, but also plague the modern culture and society. Mark Dombeck (2007), a licensed psychologist, wrote in his article ""The Long Term Effects of Bullying"" that damages on identity and self-esteem are primary negative consequences of bullying. In extreme cases, physical violence in teen bullying might lead to injury and death; however, the more devastating effects are always the emotional and psychological trauma, bullying will destroy an individual. Socially, teen bullying has an inescapable connection with social functioning since the moral development of youths today will have impact on the social development of future generations. Generating bullying, discrimination and inequality over gender, age, and socioeconomic occur between kids will remain as a problem in society. As a matter of fact, school yard bullies will possibly develop into workplace bullies since the bullies are more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors in their adulthood. Additionally, the childhood adversity will cause trust issue and mental health problem on adults. As a result, teen bullying potentially leads to some corruptions in modern culture and society. 
Secondly, the support from school community and appropriate intervention are very effective in teen bullying. Teenagers are powerless, sensitive, and easily impacted by the environment, so it's important to support the kids involved in order to stop the ongoing bullying and to minimize the effects. For all kids, a supportive environment from parents and community is crucial for their mental health and growth. The study in ""Parenting styles and bullying involvement"" (2014) shows that teenagers not involved in bullying perceive more affection and pleasant communication from their parents; on the contrary, kids involved in bullying usually perceive more psychological control from parents. This result demonstrates how the environment can influence the kids from little things in life. Teenagers are suffering from a feeling of inferiority and insecurity and getting lost while involving in bullying. This again makes appropriate intervention and support very important. In ""The Long Term Effects of Bullying"" by Mark Dombeck (2007), statics shows that anti-bullying programs are effective in reducing bullying and victimization by 20% to 23% in intervention schools as compared with control conditions. To make life safer and happier for large numbers of youth and students, the whole community should offer support to prevent bullying. 
The final main reason why we should work together on anti-bullying is that promoting anti-bullying foster a democratic and loving-kindness atmosphere in our society. In my interview with <NAME>, education psychology Ph.D. at Purdue university, he said, ""Anti-bullying is important basically just on a foundational level-it's important for democracy."" Bullying is wrong because it's against our idea of democracy and equality. To pursue a more democratic, peaceful and equal world, we shouldn't tolerate bullying and discrimination in our new young generation. School, parents, and community are responsible to educate our kids to tolerate and appreciate diversities of others. While implementing the anti-bullying program, a message of respecting people and protecting the minority will be delivered to the public. 
A common misconception is that teen bullying exists as a natural part of growing-up, rather than a pressing social and educational issue. However, I believe if one must endure some hardship to grow up, bullying is something we can avoid. Being bullied, or being an outsider at school, the kid will easily lose self-identity and confidence at such a young age. Experience of bullying will only do more harm than good on people, and sometimes it will develop into something out of control; therefore, it's absolutely necessary for adults to intervene and stop teen bullying. Another misconception about teen bullying is that the ""victims"" must be ""asking for troubles"", so it's kids' business instead of everyone else's. I totally disagree with this opinion because children's perceptions about ""wrong and right"" are always immature. How much to be autonomous and strong-minded but not selfish and aggressive? how much to accommodate society by constraining some ""bad instincts"" in yourselves but not losing your identities? Children need to learn these from experienced adults or their friends, they shouldn't be left alone. 
In conclusion, I believe public should work together to implement anti-bullying and intervention program in order to protect our youths, reduce the negative impacts of bullying on society, and promote a democratic and empathetic atmosphere in society. Despite being unable to criminalize bullying behavior and eliminate bullying, school and community can prevent bullying through educating and penalizing the bullies, protecting and comforting the victims, and raising public's awareness on teen bullying. We still have a long way to go, but together we will become a shield to protect the young generation.

"The magical and controversial effects of the internet on Chinese students 
The internet is known a very common technology as multiple tools to help human beings to communicate, gather newest information and entertain. Although many argue that the internet brought us more negative impacts for us in overall, I insist to hold my view of more positive side because never before had I seen such a boost in clarity, success, and productivity in our own work. 
To begin with my argument, I want to speak something from views of my ""opponents"". They hold a very controversial view against me by voicing that the internet is bad and caused a lot of unexpected negative effects which we should not experience. For instance, Chinese students like to go to internet caf where it is not allowed for people who are under 18, they use the internet to cheat in class, and the information on the internet distract them from learning to a large degree, according to Mia D.G 2014, ""China rings in the changes by forcing students to put their mobiles in giant classroom phone holders before lessons."" 
These effects without doubts, do exist in our society and I cannot deny the existence of these facts, however, what I would like to argue is that these facts they provided only blocked us into the limited sights of the negative side of the internet. In contrast, I do not think many Chinese students frequently use cell phones frequently in class for other non-learning purposes and are reported on the news which sometimes mislead people. So some people took that as a common behavior which in my opinion is completely not a wise decision. At least, from my knowledge about surrounding schools and the schools in my province, I would say the phenomena mentioned above rarely being seen on my sight. 
Another explanation can be used to argue my ""opponents"" is that the internet is merely a tool as any other common tool that we commonly use today. Didn't we say the TV influenced us negatively pretty much? Imagining back to several years ago when TV started being populated, it distracted us a lot at the first place by providing various funny advertisement, dramas, talk shows and so on. Again, there were the ""same"" several people disagree with the TV itself and denied its positive effects by arguing TV is bad and should be banned according to Emuna B 2006 ""Distracted by Television"". How about now? We all accepted, and don't we? Therefore, the internet as well as the TV is a modern high-tech product that some people who lack of future vision wouldn't accept at the first place but in fact we all in agreement that the internet has more positive effects than its negative impacts. 
What are the positive effects that convinced me to hold my view so much against the negative ones? So obvious answers to question are these: the internet improved students' efficiency on study, the internet broaden students' vision in many aspects and the internet brought students a new way of entertaining. With the help of the internet, students can search so much information that related to their study like Math, Physics, History, Geography, Art and etc. Once the needed information Chinese students gathered, they can take advantage of it and combine it into their work. For instance, if I want to research about the geographical distribution of China, I do not even need to purchase an actual map of my county. The only thing I do is to type ""China Map"" in google search bar, and the searched results will pop up with many options that I can download for free for me. Also, the different results offer me diverse patterns of these electronic maps which allow me to browse further knowledge of China Map, like the weather of geographic distribution of China, and the terrain distribution of China. 
For doing things for fun on the internet, I believe most of students already have plenty of games installed in their i Phones, i Pods, and i Pads. And I also believe that a lot of students have their personal apps that saved hundreds of music and movies. If one day you ask a question for them: what do you think and how you will feel if people don't have the internet? Finally, I believe that feel desperate they will by saying they are going to die in response to your question. 
The internet plays an important tool in the whole society, and it might not be accepted by some parents who usually hold old opinions at the first place. Well, as time goes by, and as the internet become fully covered on this planet, the positive effects of the internet such as it envisioned us, improved our efficiency of study, and helped to entertained us will finally be wide accepted. According to the results from my interviewee <name> personal communication, April 14th 2016, negative view orientated people need to have broader cognition by reading books and communicating with more people. In this way, they will see my argument is correct finally. So ironically speaking, the negative speaker will probably end up switching to my side by making a long clapping.

Germline Engineering: Embryo Editing 
Argumentative Essay 
In 2015, a group of scientist from China published an online journal, Protein & Cell (Puping L. et. al, 2015) which proved the world that experiments involving the human embryo are currently being conducted. This sparked an uproar of debates between scientists and ethicists regarding the implications of such experiments. The inauguration of gene editing, specifically, germline engineering which allows the possibility of having babies without the inherited disease can now potentially allow genetic diseases to be prevented rather than cured. Especially with the newly invented technology, CRISPR-Cas9, the prospect of using human embryos in experiments seems promising in the future as scientists are able to cut and splice genes at specific regions of the DNA molecule easily. Hence, the advent of this technology has the potential to bring endless opportunities for mankind to combat many inherited diseases and improve life conditions. 
Thereupon, I strongly concur with the fact that human embryos should be permitted in germline engineering as it can potentially fix genetic diseases and increase our understanding of the human genome (complete set of gene sequences for humans). Thus, germline engineering is asserted to be beneficial than harmful to mankind. 
According to the experiment carried out by Chinese scientists at Sun Yat-sen University (Puping L. et. al, 2015), it is proven that editing human embryos can bring us closer to correcting genetic diseases in the future. The team had successfully cleaved the endogenous -globin gene (the gene that contributes to thalassemia- a genetic disease) using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology with 71 embryos that survived from the 86 that was tested. This promising experimental result strengthens the argument that human embryos should be permitted in germline engineering as they allow scientists to better understand the implications of the modifications made. It is possible to use animal embryos, however, they will not come close to the level of similarity in terms of their gene sequences when compared to human embryos. In an interview <name> , a biological science graduate from Purdue University, mentioned that since the aim of this particular experiment was to help find a cure for human beings, it would not be feasible to use the systems of animals or other organisms. She acknowledged that working on non-viable human embryos on the other hand, was the closest genetic system that we can use to study genetics in humans. 
Furthermore into this deliberation, it is viable to propose that perhaps using other ways fixing genetic diseases that do not require the modification of the human genome will be more likely because editing genes from its natural state can interfere with the human germline. In an article in the Huff Post (2015), Darnovsky, an American policy advocate on politics of human biotechnology, mentioned that using gene editing on human embryos is not a medical approach, but a way to create new human beings. There seems to be a paradox in this claim for a number of reasons. It is insensible to deduce that people cannot choose how they are going to have their children by saying that gene editing creates new human beings. People should have the freedom to decide how they would like to reproduce as this is also human rights in general. In addition, germline engineering can be regarded as a logical extension of IVF, which stands for in-vitro fertilization that allows parents to choose what characteristics their babies will have since donor sperms and ovum can be selected from other people. When Louise May Brown, the first test tube baby was born on 25 July 1975 (About Education, 2016), the public was concerned about the permissibility of such act but now, society generally accepts the concept of IVF. Similarly, when editing human embryos in germline engineering progresses and is proven to help patients, the societal norms can be gradually changed. 
On the other hand, editing human embryos in germline engineering is projected as a way to decrease genetic diversity if the human germline can be controlled. To an extent, this proposition is probable as it can lead eugenics, that is, beliefs and practices that aims to improve the genetic quality of the human population. If people have the freedom to choose how their babies will look like, such as choosing eye color and intelligence, diversity can potentially be reduced. As logical as this claim sounds, it cannot be fully agreed upon as the human genome itself is constantly changing based on various external factors. Stated in Article 3 of Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (1997), ""the human genome, which by its nature evolves, is subject to mutations. It contains potentialities that are expressed differently according to each individual's natural and social environment, including the individual's state of health, living conditions, nutrition and education."" Based on this article, it is universally accepted that the human germline is not placed into a certain boundary in which it cannot be subjected to change. Therefore, even when germline engineering is progressed and made available, there is little chance that there will be reduced genetic diversity. Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard University proposed that heritable psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality, are the product of hundreds or thousands of genes, each with a tiny effect. Even when the embryo is edited to make characteristic enhancements, it is unlikely that every modification results in the desired traits. Hence, this invigorates the argument that genetic diversity is decreased if germline engineering is used to control the human germline. 
Given these points, it can be logically claimed that embryo editing in germline engineering should be permitted as it can increase our understanding of the human genome and can potentially allow us to fix genetic diseases. This assertion can be endorsed by the promising experimental result done by the Chinese scientists (Puping L. et. al, 2015). Although editing human embryos in germline engineering is still at its preliminary stages, its potential benefit of preventing genetic diseases outweighs the concerns that govern the society. Certainly, it is expected that germline engineering would be opposed as it goes against societal norms but ultimately, these norms can gradually change when this technology progresses and can be proven to improve life conditions. As mentioned by Debra Matthews from John Hopkins (2015), fears inspired by science fiction often get all the attention in popular culture, while the very real potential benefits or risks of genetic research go unexplored and undiscussed. Thus, in order for the society to accept this technology and gain its potential benefits, it is paramount for us to consider the justifications of allowing human embryo editing in germline engineering, like the few that were mentioned in this paper.

"Stop Fast Food for Life 
When you walk on the road, you may be able to find and see many fast food restaurants at anywhere. When you enter any buildings, you can find many signs that say ""ready to serve."" Why is there so many fast food restaurants around? The reason is obvious; with our busy lifestyles, eating fast food has become a fast and easy way to satisfy one's hunger. However, while people are attracted to fast food that is convenient, they are missing some very significant problems of eating fast food. In fact, fast foods affect not only people's health but also, the quality of life. 
Through the growth of fast food industry over the past few years, many younger adults prefer to consume fast food for saving time and improving their quality of lives. People do not think that the food is worth their while for increasing their quality of lives. However, that is not true. Even though people think that fast food save and give time and improve the quality of life, their obsession with fast food are adversely affecting their quality of lives. First, the human body is suffering. Since 1950s, many scientists demonstrated that the fast food includes low nutritional value, high sodium and sugar content, and high fat and calories, which does not provide sufficient and necessary nutrition and minerals. If people do not get enough nutrition and minerals from eating, they will be sick and unable to get some opportunities to enjoy their lives. 
Another serious health concern about fast food is obesity. Nowadays, childhood obesity is a serious issue around the globe. According to the global health statistic reports by WHO (2007), the nutritional value of fast food consumed by children in Australia is gradually decreased and the rate of child obesity has dramatically increased over the past 30 years. As the statistic has shown, in recent time, the younger generation is the largest consumer group of fast food. However, ""childhood obesity is particularly troubling because the extra pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once confined to adults.""1 It means childhood obesity increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure in the future. More serious, cancer also can be caused by childhood obesity. 
In addition, fast food contains not only low nutritional value, fat, high sodium and sugar, but also chemical substances such as flavorings and preservatives. Those chemical substances used to extend the expiration date of meats and bread. Also, those chemical additives design to make the food more appetizingly. However, those chemical additives cause behavioral disturbance of children, such as hyperactivities (ADHD)2 and poor concentration. Continuously, much scientific research has linked to fast food to ADHD. ""Excessive use of fast foods and other foods of poor nutritional value can cause kids to display behavior like ADHD,""3 said Frank Barnhill, an expert on ADHD. ADHD is a very serious mental problem. It always begins in childhood, but it could continue into adulthood. As a result, it affects almost all aspects of their daily lives. 
	On the other points of view, people disagree with the fast food containing low nutritional value because fast food like pizza and hamburger includes fresh vegetables and bread made with oats. They believe these vegetables and oats give enough nutrition to our bodies. However, that is not true. The human's body needs various nutrition than nutrition that contain in pizza and hamburger. Through the fast food, person cannot get sufficient and various nutrition what a person needs for a healthy body. Also, they believe the reason of behavioral problem is a birth defect. Birth defect and hereditary are factor of behavioral problem. However, I also can say that today's eating habits are the most reason for symptom ADHD in children. Even though their ideas are really creative, they do not wish to tangle with others for their health problems. 
	In conclusion, while many people won't be able to eat fresh and homemade food every day, people can begin to improve their quality of lives by buying and eating high nutrition and fresh foods when they have some options. I believe that If people consume healthy foods than fast food, people will have much healthier and enjoyable lives.

Globalization and the increasing number of overseas students had attracted people's attention on English teaching since 1980s. People started to realize that English teaching is problematic in China. Either the Ministry of Education or some private tuition centers had tried a lot of ways to change it, but problems still exist. To further improve English teaching in China, I think Chinese Ministry of Education should perfect English examination system. One way to achieve this is to specialize English examination. 
First and foremost, specializing English examination reduces unbalanced development of students' English functioning. As English teaching in China is exam-oriented and English examinations in China now focus only on testing reading and listening skills, speaking is unvalued in Chinese schools. Thus, students are not given many opportunities to practice speaking English, but required to put all their efforts in reading passages and memorizing vocabularies in schools. It is hard to change the exam-oriented education system as examination is still the most efficient way to test large population of students currently, so the Ministry of Education should create an examination that specializes in testing spoken language which will underline the importance of speaking and force teachers to change their teaching methods. Thus, students are provided more opportunities to speak English and English teaching in China will be more integrated. 
Secondly, the English examinations in colleges are too general to fulfill the different needs of different majors. CET-4 and CET-6 are the only two standard English examinations in colleges which are compulsory for every college student. Thus, colleges provide students English course to study for these two examinations. However, as the course and examinations only cover general English vocabularies and grammars which repeat parts of the English knowledge in high school, many students lose the interest in learning English in colleges. Also, for students who have to learn professional vocabularies in their majors, this kind of general English course is useless and they still need to study professional English by themselves. Thus, colleges should specialize English examinations for different majors to make English teaching in colleges more efficient and more helpful for students. This also help prepare students to apply graduate schools in foreign countries. 
Last but not least, as I have mentioned above, every college student has to take CET-4 and CET-6, and these two examinations are used to measure students' English level, however, I think this measurement is unscientific. For instance, students who study history and students who study literature must be required to know different categories of vocabularies, so they should not be tested by the same examinations which will result in an inaccurate reflection of students' real level. Also these general examinations cannot show their English level in their professional fields. Thus, specialized English examinations for different majors provide a more comprehensive evaluation for students' English proficiency. Also, the score of the specialized English examination will be a more persuasive reference in one student's resume. 
Many people may think that testing speaking will not improve students' spoken language but limit them because teachers will teach them some standard format to cope with the examination. And this will limit students' expression in a single way. However, the ultimate goal of specializing the speaking examination is not testing speaking but to attract schools' attention on teaching speaking skills and drive teachers to value speaking in their classes. It is true that many teachers may provide students standard formats to help them speak, but this also helps students build confidence in speaking when they score well. I believe this is a effective method to start the reformation. 
Others may argue that specializing examination in colleges for different majors requires large amount of resources and costs a lot. However, I believe that any reformation requires large amount of input at the beginning. Also, as the courses and examinations now repeats the knowledge in high school, these can be considered as a waste of resources though they cost less. Comparing with wasting the resources, I think investing more resources and creating a more efficient education system is more valuable and sustainable. 
When we cannot change an education system, the best we can do is to perfect it. In an exam-oriented education system, examination is the best tool that we can use to influence the teaching methods. Thus I believe specializing English examination is a effective way to improve English teaching in China.

"Wake Up, Only Admitting System is the Key 
In today society of China, Gaokao, the Chinese national college entrance exam, is always a heat topic in education. The main reason is that it influences or even decides one's life in high school and university. However, I could merely agree with part of that statement. In educational system, there is one part called university admitting system including diversified selection criteria, multiple opportunities, and organized admission committee, with each of them impacting on students' development and opportunities of going to university. While in China, Gaokao is only one of those criteria included in the system. As a result, it is the system behind the Gaokao that shapes students' entire development in high school and their future. 
To begin with, university admitting systems influence students' development considerably with admitting criteria. The system contains various criteria, through which the universities evaluate students' performance and ability in many aspects. Those criteria in some degree push students to work hard and to be competitive for being qualified by university. Therefore, different criteria have distinctively boosted influences on student. Take standard test as an example. Standard tests help student lay solid intellectual foundation for upcoming university life. In terms of those standard tests such as Gaokao, SAT, and TOEFL, they have students concentrated on learning, guaranteeing students to receive those fundamental knowledge required by tests. ""Stricter standards and increased testing are better preparing school students for college"" asserted by Louis V. Gerstner Jr. in ""The Tests We Know We Need"", posted on New York Times. In Jan. 1998, Public Agenda found that 66% of college professors said ""elementary and high schools expect students to learn too little."" By Mar. 2002, after a surge in testing and the passing of NCLB, that figure dropped to 47% ""in direct support of higher expectations, strengthened standards and better test, provided by Public Agenda of the article ""Where's the Backlash? Students Say They Don't Fret Standardized Tests."" Although the knowledge may seem to be only useful in tests, it gradually shapes students' habits to relate themselves more to social events, and forms their own judgments towards arguable issues. Beside those standard tests, there are many other kinds of criteria could be considered. Application essay is one of them. It helps students to think about their choices rationally and encourage them to plan for their future career. While some universities ask students to write down their reasons of applying such university, some require students to write down thoughts such as how the world shapes their dreams. For instance, one topic of Essay for 2015 application of Purdue University is that ""Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family"" According to Kelton Render, the counselor of admission committee in Purdue, he said ""when students think about those questions, most of them start reflecting of their life, seeking for their goals, dream, and they themselves. After such reflection, the way to the future becomes more clear and brighter because, through a process of thinking, they would be steadfast to realize dreams."" Moreover, as one of the criteria, rewards receiving never loses its influence on encouraging students to develop inside out instead of solely intellectually, cultivating their personalities positively. ""In academic competitions, not everyone wins or receives a trophy. Those who didn't win can learn to be gracious losers without allowing the loss to damage their self-esteem or hinder their willingness to participate in future competitions"" said by Kristine Tucker whose articles have been featured in many online publications. In order to enrich resume or experience, students in high school would make efforts to take part it competitions. Even though this might be too harsh for students, it actually forces them to learn comprehensively and deeply. Finally, not only could rewards make deep impressions on university but importantly enhance students' personality as well. 
The system, for international students, in the US is more complicated, requiring SAT, GPA, application essay, rewards, recommendation letters, and TOEFL. As a result, students in the US are always considered to be more creative, thoughtful and well-rounded. However, not two university admitting systems are exactly the same. For most of universities in China, they use Gaokao as the only criterion throughout the admitting process. Thus, students become scored-oriented and only care about scores from tests. ""The system influenced by Gaokao could be regarded as conveyor belt because it conveys outcomes-oriented students."" said by Gregory Kristof, a student studying abroad in Tsinghua University, in his article of ""Don't Kowtow to the Gaokao."" Studying within such system, unfortunately, students passively become one-sided. 
Secondly, Opportunities of going to top universities, provided by different university admitting system, are different. On one hand, the obvious example should be how many times that students have for tests. According to College Board, students could take 7 times of SAT at most in a year. By doing so, the US admitting system let students to show the best to university and prevent a situation that the very test determines one's future. On the contrary, Gaokao, as I have mentioned is an only way to university to most students, is held only once a year in China. Therefore, like the title I put for on another essay I wrote, it is a one-shot gambling. Students put their 12-year effort on this test. Once they fail, the way out is to quit or wait one more year. University is a place providing more chances and opportunities to students, isn't it? However, under such system in China, could one deny that luck doesn't play a role in it? Luck should not take part in this game. On the other hand, another example is that the difference of opportunities exists in choosing universities when one apply and after being accepted. Last year, I had applied at least 10 universities around the US and finally received 6 offers. Having compared those universities, I chose to study in Purdue University after all. By allowing students to apply unlimited universities and choose universities which accept them, the system protects equal opportunities for every students. On the opposite, According to the policy applied in Gaokao, before knowing the scores, students have to complete a form of priority of university they want to get in after the Gaokao. Moreover, after being accepted by the certain university, one is only allowed to enter that university and no alternations remained on the platform. Application ends at that point. In this situation, guessing the scores, students might be over cautious, worrying about missing top university or not being accepted. Because when guessing the scores, suffering the same feeling as that in gambling, one may overestimate or underestimate one's score. Therefore, this rule probably led higher-scored students missing top universities if they underestimated. 
As a consequence, in terms of opportunity, there is a gap between two systems. Maybe the gap is not distinctive enough to be noticed. However, it has great impact on student. Regarding the difference of opportunities, students probably prefer the one that has more chances and, thus, some talents may choose to study abroad instead of staying in China, taking a chance in the ""gambling."" 
Finally, there is another system-admission committee protecting the equal opportunity. In each admitting system, even the one in the US, there are conflicts during reviewing students' materials. Therefore, the admission committee exists as lubricant, reducing conflict and ensuring fairness to maximum extent. For example, according to Kelton Render, one counselor working admission committee in Purdue University, when students are on the border of lines, he would bring students' materials to the committee and have discussions with other counselors in order to make it fair both to those students and other applicants. Through this method, guarantee of fair decision is made. What's more, in order to keep personal criteria away from reviewing applications, 	admission committee holds training for each qualified counselor every summer, prior to the start of application, based on his statement. Again, fairness is protected. Nevertheless, even there is one thing called admission committee in China, it does not have the functions of protecting the opportunities. As a student studied in Chinese high school for three years, I know that the admitting procedure is inflexible. Universities accept students by ranking students with scores of Gaokao and the committee does not have to worry about the rest of work once it set up the scores line because the computers place students automatically. Consequently, the entire university admitting process in China, for most of cases, only involves the selection based on the scores, without considering other aspects of students. And this definitely harms the opportunities that students have for enrolling in top universities, which confirms students' idea of leaving and push them to vote for a fairer system quietly. 
In conclusion, as an indispensable part of education system, university admitting system has positive influences on students. First of all, the criteria used during the reviewing of application have impacts on students' development. Secondly, the rules of application system influence the opportunity of students being accepted by university. Unfortunately, the admitting system in China neither include so much criteria nor protection of opportunities. Consequently, on the one hand, that most universities take tests as the only criterion makes student less creativity, even less development in other aspects. On the other hand, as a result of unequal opportunity provided by university admitting system, students have to consider studying abroad as their ways out of such dilemma, in order to have better academic progress in future. To change this situation, alternations are necessary. They should be about the university admitting system which is the bridge between students and university. Only those alternations could solve the dilemma that China meets. Only those alternations could help students develop thoughtfully and stop the brain drain happening in China. Wake up, only the university admitting system is the key.

"P5D1 Argumentative Essay Assignment 
April 9, 2015 
Too Early and No Meaning 
Did you remember the lovely robots called Tars, Case and Kipp in the new sci-fi movie <Interstellar>? In the movie, they are really clever robots and help the main character, Copper, to travel successfully. Will it be possible to have such a robot in the future? Or they will just appear in novels or movies? Artificial Intelligence is an area working for these interesting things. In the area of AI, scholars now are trying to make human-level robots, that means, robots which have the same emotions, reasoning and thinking as humans. If AI robots can be invented, they will totally change our life. However, many scholars think about Artificial Intelligence from another side. They are worrying about the relationship between AI machines and humans. Because robots are much stronger than humans, so if they become our emeries, we will be led by robots. The famous movie <Matrix> tells a story under such a background. What's more, in Is Artificial Intelligence a Threat? (Angela Chen, 2014) from The Chronicle of Higher Education, Angela Chen mentioned that the Center for the Study of Existential Risk was established for those reasons. But in fact, it's too early to think about the danger from now. What's more, worrying about this can do nothing to help us prevent the potential danger. 
People began knowing Artificial Intelligence from 1970s. On May 11, 1997, a famous chess-playing robot appeared in the public's sight. Deep Blue defeated many famous and professional chess players from that time. Later, another AI called Watson won a quick-response game. People found it was possible for robots to understand natural words very well. More and more scholars began to do researches and made a lot of processes. Nowadays, AI robots help people in a lot of areas, such as facial recognition, eye recognition, GPS and games. It seems AI machines have entered our daily life. But does it means we need to worry about them? 
Turing test is a test which was raised by Alan Turing, the greatest expert in Computer Science. It is a test used for testing whether a machine has human intelligence. Till now, Turing Test is still held every year as a competition for AI machines. AI machines need to make humans think they are real people instead of robots by talking with real people. On June 7, 2014, At a contest marking the 60th anniversary of Alan Turing's death, a chatterbot called Eugene Goostman made 33% of the judges thought it was human. Later the organizer of this event, Kevin Warwick, considered it had passed the Turing test. Though the experts considered Eugene had passed the test, the rate was only 33%. The fact is, most people can distinguish AI and human very well. It's still a long time to make AI be able to confuse most of humans. 
""Long time"" is an undefined concept and can make people puzzled. How long will it take to make a human-level AI? The answer is no one can predict the time. In the Cambridge, Cabs and Copenhagen: My Route to Existential Risk(Huw Price,2013) from the New York Times, Huw Price talked about the concept of ""singularity"". The technological singularity is a time point that we usually consider after it, progress in technologies will accelerate and out of control. At that time, our life will totally different from nowadays'. It's just like rabbits cannot understand human's life. We cannot understand the life after the ""singularity"". So the question comes -- can the ""singularity"" be predicted? The answer is also no. Like people could not predict when the Second Industrial Revolution would happen in 1850s, we cannot the ""singularity"" as well. Moreover, it's impossible to prevent it from happening. If Edison did not invent the electric lamp, would it mean no one else could invent the lamp and the Second Industrial Revolution would not happen? Of course not. The same to researches in Artificial Intelligence. We are sure that the ""singularity"" will come someday, but no one knows how it and when. What we now know is, AI still needs a lot of achievements and there is no indication that the ""singularity"" will come in next 50 years. 
Artificial Intelligence is not the only area which working for creating intelligence. In my interview with <name>, he mentioned that biology was also working for this. Many different areas are trying to achieve intelligence, AI is just one of them and is nothing special. Biology still cannot use robots very well in difficult surgeries even the robots are controlled by people. GPS still makes mistakes very often. Siri just can answer very easy questions. All these AI machines in our life seem very harmless. Neither friends nor emeries. Just like How artificial intelligence is changing our lives (Gregory M. Lamb, 2012) comes from The Christian Science Monitor says, they are just tools which make our life much easily and more convenient now. Will they be harm to us? Maybe they will, but it will only happen in hundreds of years later. 
Artificial Intelligence is an amazing area and make all of us think about future life. But worrying about its danger is not necessary now. Since AI needs a long period of time to achieve human-level, we should not focus on it too much. In fact, we cannot do something as well. Like <name> said, what we should worry about and focus on are the problems about hunger, world peace, illness and poverty. These things are what we are facing now. Only we can solve the problems we are suffering now, we can think about the distant future.

"Will Anime Become Computer-Dependent 
Will anime become computer-dependent 
It is now the 21th century which is called the age of information or actually could be ""the age of computer"". And animation is a kind of art and entertainment like film or TV series, which is the only art that has a certain ""birthday""-the first animation was made in 10. 28 1892, which now has a history of more than 100 years. And today's animation, influenced by the age of information, are actually closely related to computer, no matter producing or watching. However, there are still lots of parts of animation remains original. Like 2D animations are designed and draw by hands and pencil. There are a lot of animation lovers in the world, some of them holds the opinion that ""Oh, animations like the 2D style are the best and we have get enough use of computer in the animation field and it will remains like this. Animation will not depend more on computer. So will animation in the future, like those people above said, will just depend as much as it is now on computer and improver its other part to improve itself or computer will take more parts of animation and it will become more computer-dependent? Actually I like those 2D animation without much computer work, but I stand on the opposite side. As a students of computer science, I believe that everything and every field in the world, with the development of computer, will be influenced more and more by computer, including the field of animation. 
To support my opinion, I will take the compare and compete of 2D animation and 3D animation. Here 3D animation, which is mostly made by computer through those programs like animation graphic programs, refers to the parts of animation with the help of computer. And on the other side, 2D animation, which just use computer in the final produce and are original and mostly made by hand, refers to the opposite parts of 3D animation that without much of computer work. From the article I read, Japanese animation field, which is the world's biggest and best animation area, show up the conflict and differences between 3D and 2D animation. Although 3D computer animation films have made profit and succeed, Japanese animation makers still prefer to produce 2D cartoons, over 2000 of which are produced annually.( Jan Krikke, Computer Graphics Advances the Art of Anime, May/June 2006) Instead of 3D animation, most Japanese anime studio focus on 2D animation as it is economic and aesthetic. So at this time, 2D is still the main part of Japanese animation fields. Japanese anime, known for dynamic and calligraphic, is closely connected to manga, which is also called comic. Manga is actually related to one kind of scroll painting called ukiyo-e (""pictures of the floating world"", a genre of woodblock prints and paintings that flourished in Japan from the 17th through 19th centuries). Influenced by manga, Japanese animation stands out for its visual immediacy and boldness of vision. Not only the vision but also the production of anime and ukiyo-e is similar, both of which are made from separate effort and work. Different people play different rules in the production, from drawing to transferring. Toei Studios, called as the Disney of Japan, is one of few Japanese animation studios which are the same as those of Western country, use computer to draw unlike most Japanese studios that draw by paper and pencils. (Jan Krikke, Computer Graphics Advances the Art of Anime, May/June 2006) 
Although Japanese anime remain in 2D and seems to be not willing to change, they do, or at least more and more of them do use 3D tech in their productions. They add 3D CG to make their products more international and also more similar to the real word. Those anime with some 3D look actually helped them become more popular. Also, 3D is a more complicated which also provides the maker better specific ways of making with better effect and also improve the whole quality of the product. As a result of the benefit of 3D objects, it becomes a challenge for animators to make mixture use of both 2D anime and 3D projects. Some tool for photo realistic programmed to help this have been using for some time and received good effect. And according to the art history, Japan should build their production more realistic as 3D. They've just make their characters and objects in their own way, own style and vision and could not refer to the reality. (Jan Krikke, Computer Graphics Advances the Art of Anime, May/June 2006) 
Besides the use of 3D tech, computer actually has helped a lot with the anime production. Although the decision of concentrate on 2D anime have no bad effect, as Japanese anime have occupied more than 60 percent of the world TV cartoons show, those company of anime still have their own worries-- the high cost and need of animators. (Buffy Naillon, e How Contributor, 2D Animation Vs. 3D animation) To solve this problem, those companies separate the production of anime and deal some part with computer. The backgrounds, objects that sort of thing are made by computer graphics software instead of being drawn by hand as the main characters are. As a result, computer reduce their cost and save them time. Furthermore, it provides better control and versatility to those anime workers. And Japans anime industries are highly separated. Instead of hand out all parts of an anime production, most studios actually work on some specific parts of one production, making it better and then combine with other parts. Influenced by Japan, many other country in the world now have started this type of anime made. Some universities in America also have those kinds of courses (at such schools as Pixar University, Cal Arts, Sheridan, and the University of California, Los Angeles, animation courses and animation graphic courses had been set up.) 
From the situation of Japanese animation field, I found that, no matter what do people think and like, the world of animation cannot avoid the more and more use of computer and also the more and more percentage of 3D in animation. Both audience and animation company attend to like 3D animation. As a conclusion, 3D animation has those of advantages that 2D one have not: For those animation companies, it reduce the cost of making, it save the time of producing a new animation and also it makes them more easily to separate the producing into pieces to make high quality and also more easily to revise in the final part of produce of the animation. For us audiences, 3D animation tells more about the real world, it is more related to us and it show higher qualities in the pictures, background and movement. Also it provides more vision profits to us. From those advantages and todays situation of animation, it is easy to predict that animation will become more computer-dependent in the future. 
Conclusion 	 
From the research of mine, I finally get a conclusion: Animation will become more computer-dependent for three reasons: Computer saves the time and money to make an anime, which reduce the cost of an anime production so that anime companies would be happy to use it. Computer programs make the anime more real, the back ground or characters would be more like they are in the real world so it will become more popular than those anime without much computer work. Computer, as a platform of anime watching and communicating, are not replaceable because it is convenient, fast and accuracy. However, everything has two sides. Those original animations made by hand and pencil also have its own advantages. They are actually currently more popular in teenagers and youth because the characters in them are quit quiet and lovely. 
Because of those advantages of both computer-dependent animation and animation that are independent from computer, I think animation will include more computer work in the future, but it will take a long time to replace the original anime.

"The Oppression of Female in China 
Recently, the issue of protecting women has been posed among the general public due to the death of a pregnant woman in Chinese society. In Xiangtan, China, a pregnant woman died in a cesarean surgery due to the amniotic fluid embolism. As for the reason of the woman's death, some people attribute it to the hospital, while others think that the family held up too much time to make the decision to excise the woman's uterus. This event aroused a heated discussion about what kind of roles women play in a family, and how women can protect themselves against some ""expectations"" like being a mother, a girl, and a female citizen from Chinese traditional culture. However, in my perspective, this case is not just about the medical safety, it is also about the women's status in China. After doing a series of researches, I found out that the oppressions of female still exist in China, and it is largely related to the Chinese traditional culture: Confucianism. Thus, in this essay, I will talk about the social facts of women oppression and the effect that Confucianism brought to women. 
The oppressions of women include stereotypes, doing gender, and gender discrimination. Dana Bisignani, who is a teaching assistant in Women Gender Sexual Study, accepted my interview and gave the clear definitions about these three different concepts: a stereotype is a simplified and standardized conception or image invested with special meaning and held in common by members of a group, which is often far from the truth; doing gender means individuals are judged in terms of their failure or success to meet gendered societal expectations, and people are assigned different tasks based on their gender; and gender discrimination is the unequal treatment of people and preference based on their gender identities. 
From my own observation, these facts are easy to be found in Chinese society. People often hold the opinion that women should be feminine, submissive, and compliant and their success standard for women is simplistic and superficial, somehow, a ""happy"" family and a ""decent"" job represent women's ability and success. Besides, female in China face a great gender discrimination and limitations on their daily life including their political rights, self-development and living standards. 
Unfortunately, when people face these situation as I addressed above, they usually treat it as a family issue or a social issue and have little awareness that it is about gender equality or human right. As a result, both men and women are victims of this gender practice and act as oppressors to the next generation. 
	From the journals I have read, I found that this social construction has been internalized into their nature in the fair long history and it is largely related to Confucian culture. The Confucianism required strict classical training developed through disciplined ritual practice and the strict confinement within the domestic roles of the family in the 18th century. Therefore, women were labeled success being a perfect trifle-dealer and a good husband-helper in the family. Additionally, in the political aspect, it is hard for women to get access to the central political power in a patriarchal society. Besides these invisible constraints on Chinese women, the authority, even with good intentions, established laws claiming women need special protection and certain work categories or positions are unfit for women. 
	After the investigations about women status in China, I admit the improvement of female consciousness and revere the efforts that people made for an equal environment. However, the injustice and inequality still exist, which we cannot deny and ignore. We can also draw a connection with Confucianism to women's liberation, and have a long term to struggle for women and improve women's status in China.

"To Stay or Not to Stay, This is a Question 
At Purdue University, there is over ten percent of the population from China and over thirty percent from all over the world. What would happen to a domestic student when all of his or her international friends graduate and come back to their home countries? How would the social network continue if one or many of it being broken? What actions would employees do in order to make diversity? Apparently, the increasing international population has grabbed people's attention. However, people care too much about the how they deal with culture shock and different behavior styles. What should be paid more attention to is what they truly bring to this society and how can they better stay in this society. Career, for many students, is a final goal of going to universities. It's the same for the international students as well. As an important part of evaluation, internships usually are the best way to get experience and also extra money. For international students, the situation of getting internships is much more complicated than others. Based on research and interview, I conclude that international students encounter many difficulties while they try to find an internship and some of the reasons are biased. 
Body 1 
One of the reason is that people from the society tend to view international students as ""outsiders"" and thus they are not really willing to give out working spots. 
-Inhospitality from local people 
Body 2 
Many international students choose to leave the United States after they finish the college life. 
-Companies are not willing to train those who won't contribute in the future 
-The past history makes employees hesitate when they are considering hiring international students 
Body 3 
Politics plays an important role. 
-Government and law regulations 
-Protection of technology

"Antidepressant Drugs: Good or Bad? 
Purdue University 
04/15/15 
Introduction 
According to Dr. <Name>, a general practitioner in Malaysia, depression is a medical disorder in which ""a persistent low mood and aversion to activity affects a person's thoughts, behaviors and well-being"" (personal communication, 2015). The most common treatment for depression is antidepressants. However, until today, it is still controversial whether antidepressant drugs are safe or effective. Although people say that antidepressants have many negative side effects and should not be used, I still think that antidepressants are necessary as a complement to therapy, and they can be safe to use as long as the correct prescriptions are taken. 
Body 
I used to have depression and at the same time I have met people who have been diagnosed with depression. Due to this I feel it is very important to find a proper treatment for depression because for one who has gone through the darkest chapter of her life, it can be said, literally, that depression is not something to joke about, as said by Elizabeth Wurtzel, ""That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to ever see the end. The fog is like a cage without a key."" For the sake of this paper, I have done research regarding depression and its treatments by doing an interview with a general practitioner, Dr. <Name> and reviewing academic journals regarding depression and antidepressants. My research questions are as follows: 
1. Are antidepressants safe to use? 
2. Are antidepressants effective? 
I will use the knowledge that I have gained to persuade people to understand the importance of antidepressants. 
Antidepressants (ADs) are not a happy pill or are they a panacea (remedy for all difficulties). ADs are prescription-only drugs that come with risks as well as benefits, and should only be taken under a doctor's supervision (John Hauser, 2013). The effectiveness of antidepressants depends on the severity of the depression. Psychiatrist, Petros Markou, M.D., said that for adults with severe depression, ""there is strong evidence that antidepressants are more effective than any other treatment."" However, for a mild depression, antidepressants are no better than a placebo (Fava, 2014) - a harmless pill prescribed for the psychological benefit. Critics would say that psychotherapy is more effective than antidepressants, but psychotherapy together with antidepressants are far more efficacious. Based on my interview with Dr. Zaahirah, she said that antidepressants alone are insufficient and that support from family and friends is also important in order for a patient to recover fully. Kelsberg and Trotter also did a review of 13 controlled clinical trials for patients with generalized anxiety disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy together with antidepressants (Kelsberg & Trotter, 2007). The review supported my previous statement in which going through therapy and taking antidepressants together is far more effective. Therefore, all of this evidence strengthens the fact that antidepressants as a complement to psychotherapy are more effective and advantageous. 
Most people are concerned about the harmful side effects of antidepressants. However, all medications have aftereffects if not taken as prescribed, but the SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) such as Prozac, Celexa and Zoloft, are said to have fewer side effects compared to other type of ADs (Ferguson, 2001). Although some people argue that SSRI's also cause side effects such as sexual dysfunction and insomnia, there are a lot of ways that researchers devised to avoid those side effects such as reduce dosage and meet a therapist (Komaroff, 2015). In addition, Lapi et al reviewed a large sample of data from the United Kingdom Critical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and it is shown that antidepressants do not associate with increased risk of c AF (Lapi, 2015). In contrast, a millionaire philanthropist, Sir Peter Lampl who had depression was claimed to have an immediate personality changes after consuming the antidepressants he was prescribed with. To refute this argument, Psychiatrist Dr William Shanahan, medical director at Capio Nightingale Hospital, London, is insistent that anti-depressants are safe. Shanahan mentioned that Peter Stampl's case is very unusual and difficult to explain without a full pharmaceutical history. He added that such an extreme reaction would probably be caused by external factors such as a build-up of medication, linked with another illness, stress or alcohol consumption. All in all, critics said that antidepressants should not be used in treating major depression because they have a lot of negative side effects. However, this argument are clearly flawed. 
Conclusion 
As a conclusion, I would like to underline that antidepressants are important in the treatment of depression. As much as they are said to be ineffective, antidepressants do make a significant changes when combined with therapy. At the same time, the statement of which antidepressants have negative side effects is inapplicable as all medications have side effects if it is not prescribed accordingly. However, I still want to highlight that AD is not an elixir and it would not work its 'magic' in treating depression without external supports. Taking medications is also not a sign of weakness, but rather, a sign of courage within imperfection. Therefore, the next time we encounter someone who has depression; remember that ""There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds."" (Laurell K. Hamilton).

"Teenagers should participate in more Sport Activities 
Social life is an important part of campus life, which could make one person's life much more interesting, and sports are useful tools for teenagers to expand their social life. Sports provide teenagers many ways to practice their social skills, and team sports like basketball match are good ways to earn experience and widen the friend circle. Since sports are common interests of an enormous number of people, it could improve the activeness of students. So teenagers should actively participate in sports activities. 
Sports could benefit teenagers in many fields to help to improve their social life, for example, youth could have greater leadership and learn team work through participation of corporative sports so that they would have be sophisticated in communication. Researchers from University of Michigan gathered physical and mental data from 709 six grade kids, and then divided them by leadership level. The study pointed out that the kids who actively do sports showed greater leadership and empathy. This means sports can positively affect teenagers and help them to improve better leadership and empathy. Since many sports are corporative, kids must communicate with others for better score or result in a team work. During this progress, they will learn how to deal with others, and earn more opportunities of being a leader at the same time. 
It is inevitable that teen will meet many different people in their life, and the relation between teen and others is an important part of social life. Sports could contribute to making friends, which will make youth learn how to deal with different kinds of people. Through this progress, their social skills would be improved. When I just started playing basketball, I barely talked with others except my classmates since I was not familiar with them. However, basketball is a teamwork game, and players couldn't just ignore their teammates and played tricks, or they would lose easily. I didn't want to just stand and watch others playing because my team lost quickly. So I tried to communicate with partners, and it was much easier than I thought. I got familiar with my teammates fast since team gave us a sense of belonging and they also didn't want to lose. Furthermore, sports promote youth to develop a healthy sense of competition since sports provide a friendly environment for it. According to University of Florida, students of all ages, who usually take part in sports, are able to deal with competition well in fields beyond sports. First success gave me confidence and it would provide teen more opportunities to communicate with. 
Some graduated students could not get alone with their workmates when they left campus, that's because they lack of experience of corporation with others and the passion of communication or trying new things. And, sports could improve activeness of the teens. Four years ago, I never try 400-meter race and I didn't think I could make a good time since I never practiced for it. But I won a silver medal in the school sports meeting, and it really surprised me. It gave me motivation to try other sports since it led me know that I didn't really know what I can do before I try it. Yu Hong Zha, a member of sports section of PUCSSA, told me that he was invited to take part in a basketball game just because he was tall at first. He didn't play well at that time, but that game made him felt the sense of belonging and motivated him keep playing basketball. Although team sport was fresh to him, he enjoyed the time spent playing it. The first success would make teenagers continue trying and then be used to face a large amount of people, and learn how to keep calm. Just a little success can make youth feel confident, and be glad to try new thing. Have courage to try new things, and it is the way to find the interests and specials. 
On the other hand, someone would say that sports are time consuming activities, and it would minimize the time for study. Teenagers may focus on sports too much and care about study which is one of the main purposes of campus. However, study is not the only reason for teen to be in campus. Campus should be a place which make teen learn and prepare for their future in society, and it should provide youth both knowledge and experience. What's more, sitting in front of a desk is not the only way to study, and sports can also teach teen practical skills which they cannot learn from just reading books, for example, how to make friends with different kinds of people and how to appreciate the diversity of others. Furthermore, studying for a long time would make teen unfocused and reduce their efficiencies, and a relaxing through physical way like playing basketball can make them release the burden of study then empower them with motivation. 
To conclude, not everyone has specials in sports. It doesn't someone can feel happiness and confident when they are very good at particular sports. Most of teen are not professional, but they can still find their place in team sports. It is true that sports matches are not perfect for everyone to develop social skills, but it is helpful for a large amount of youth, since there are many kinds of sports which require different ability, and teenagers can still enjoy the time playing sports when they are not the better than others. Sports can be casual and unrelated about honor of school or the value of self, so teen will not feel pressure from it and can share happiness with others. Also, sports could bring benefits like improved social skills and passion, so teenagers should actively participate in sports.

Argumentative paper 
Improvement of immigrants' employment circumstance is still debatable 
	Since the first eastern Asian immigrant rush in 1820s, the employment circumstance is never favorable to those new settlers. In the first several decade of immigrant history, Eastern Asian immigrants were treated as coolie which does not have complete civil right and treated like slave. During the 1880 economic depression, a lot of states of America started restricting the employment opportunity for eastern Asian immigrants and enforced this idea by signing Chinese exclusion act in 1882. In the 1924, the congress passed the Asian exclusion act which further restricted the civil right for eastern Asian immigrants. Although all those racism law were terminated until 1952s, the termination of bias in legal system was still not sufficient to protect the Asian immigrants' right in working setting. Even though people already realize the importance of equality in modern era, the power harassment and exclusion of Asian employee are still serious problem in employment system. Such unfavorable condition are caused by three main factors, culture difference, ignorance of media, and lack of continuity of political movements. 
	Because the different linguistic and social value systems, eastern Asian immigrants are difficult to culturally adopt American life even they constantly interact with local Americans. This kind of difficulty not only creates communication barrier but also lead to Ethnocentrism. By the sociology definition, Ethnocentrism means one the tendency to assume that one's own culture and way of life represent the norm or are superior to all others. Page 60 From the New York Time, the interracial marriage rates for Asian American is dipped to 10 percent which is much lower than the average level compared to other racial groups in United States.paragraph 2-3 The low rate of interracial marriage shows that Asian American share quite different values and life styles to other racial groups in America. In other word, other racial groups also hold great bias to Asian immigrants. The lack of interaction can easily lead to negative stereotype, prejudice and discrimination. To be specific, the Asian American is widely be stereotyped as poor communicator, nerd and even academicals dishonest in USA.paragraph 2, 10 Such phenomenon not only cause mental stress and depression but also cause career development issue. From Jason Shen survey, one third of Asian American male thought they are treated worse than white man and eighty-eight percent of Asian American think their race become a barrier of career development.paragraph 4-5 
	Ignorance of mass media is other reason for the poor effect of Asian immigrants' politic action. In USA, the media normally focus on the conflict between groups of African and Latino American and white American because it is widely wanted by majority of population and can create more topics about racism issue which is one of the most popular topic in American media field. In the other side, the Asian immigrants are divided into two different income groups, one is well-educated immigrants with high skill and earn a high income and other one is uneducated refugee and illegal immigrants. In the first group, people normally have reasonable income and stay in the middle class in society. The Medias in USA have the strong tendency to be the voice to the poverty group so the educated immigrants' voice about unfavorable career development is ignored by media. On the other side, refugee and illegal immigrants normally have language barrier so they are trapped in their own culture setting like China town. China town is other dark corner which is ignored by media. In fact, the poverty rate in China is almost three times higher than other urban area in Los Angeles and one third times higher than other urban area in New York. Paragraph 10 In addition, the working time in China is much higher than other place, which shows strong unfair treatment and power harassment toward uneducated immigrants. But because of language barrier and culture characteristics, Asian immigrants normally choose to keep silence. Overall the, the unfavorable working circumstance would not be known by mass media and it won't be published toward public. 
	 Although the large Asian immigrants protest in major USA city caused by the peter Liang's incidence does make Liang spared jail from the tragedy, lack of continuity politic movement causes public choose to forget and ignore the unfair treatment to Asian immigrants. Peter Liang's incidence is not the first case that Asian immigrants are received bias treatment in the legal system. Ironically, there are two different idea toward Peter Liang's case within Asian immigrants. American born Asian called second generation immigrants widely thought Peter Liang is guilty, which is very different from first generation immigrants. This phenomenon shows other difficulty for the continuity of politic movement to improve Asian immigrants working circumstance. 
	To be concluded, Asian immigrants' poor working circumstance has been a long term social inequality issue which cause both social instability and personal dissatisfaction for long term. Although there are a lot of precautions taken to enforce racial equality, the real improvement of Asian immigrants is still debatable for three main factors, culture difference, ignorance of media, and lack of continuity of political action. The culture difference create great communicate barrier between Asian immigrants and majority social group. Then the complicity of polarized population and overgeneralization make media ignore the voice from Asian immigrants. Finally, the Asian immigrants' politics movement lack continuity, which minimize the effect of each individual politics movement. With those three factors, there is still long way to achieve equal employment circumstance.

"The beneficial aspects of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder which affecting two to three percent of people all over the world. OCD can be briefly defined as ""A process of intensive worry followed by compulsive rituals or behaviors."" Commonly, OCD patients are used to doing such repetitive behaviors as checking whether the stove is turned off or the door is locked. Unwanted thoughts, fears and worries are some symptoms of obsession. OCD results from both biological basis and environmental issues. The public disgust some symptoms of OCD patients, because they think they are strange. In order to explain some beneficial aspects of OCD, I will analyze the origination of OCD, the survival advantage of OCD and how could it improve the quality of people's daily life. 
First, OCD stems from a positive origination. Those who ostracize OCD patients consider OCD is totally a mental illness, however, it actually has some benefits. Most human beings have the ability of noticing risk factors subconsciously, which is an over-activity area of the brain. Thus, this certain area results in obsessions and compulsions. (Riadh, et. al. 1998) To be more precise, obsessions are ancient, repetitive and irksome phenomena, which people do them involuntarily. For this reason, people generate risk scenarios which they intend to avoid. In other words, people have the capability of identifying the risks in daily life and they want to prevent them happening. With this process, people could avoid harm without experiencing it. From what I have mentioned above, it indicates that OCD has a positive origination that is a risk avoidance process. 
Not only OCD originates from a positive process, but only OCD benefits to people's survival. For example, there were two cavemen called Bernie and Charlie. In fact, Bernie was an OCD patient while Charlie was not. When they slept, Charlie was afraid of nothing and was so relaxed. However, Bernie was worried about lots of things, such as whether there would be bugs, snakes and tigers. So he slept inside the cave where he could listen to Charlie's scream in case he would in danger. (Fredric, 2012) In my opinion, when people are not at a place that is safe enough, they should have the intention to avoid danger. Due to Bernie's OCD, he noticed a lot. He and his friend would be less dangerous to some extent. That is to say, Bernie had the consciousness to avoid risks, but Charlie who was a relaxed person did not. What's more, Edna, who was Bernie's cousin, was a cavewoman with OCD. When she was pregnant, she washed her hands quite often. She did know the mold which would do harm to her body though she knew nothing about germs. Edna always stayed away from sick people and the smoke. She never drank berry juice and took drugs. Last but not least, Edna had an extremely healthy diet. If she had some worry about the food, she would let the dog had a try first. Because of Edna's OCD symptoms, she was the only person who had more than three children in the tribe and raised them healthily. From the experience of Bernie and Edna, we can conclude that in some situations, people with some symptoms of OCD which can make them have a survival advantage. 
Although OCD patients have a survival advantage, people disgust some symptoms of OCD patients, like making materials extremely tidy and clean. However, in my view, some stigma of people with OCD can improve the quality of people's daily life. Suppose a person has OCD, to visit his home, the bed is made tidy, the plates are washed shiny, the floor is mopped clean, the books are arranged aligned. The visitor will have a good mood by visiting this beautiful house. Therefore, the person who has OCD will leave a perfect impression on the visitor. Moreover, if a student has a little OCD, he will be used to checking carefully whether he has already done homework everyday and make up study materials for next day's courses. Hence, he will be less likely to make such mistakes like forgetting to do homework or to bring essential study materials to class. During my interview with Dr. Eiler, who is a staff therapist at PUSH, she said that ""A little OCD could make people focused. Many successful people have a little OCD."" OCD can be considered as a continuum, ranging from mild to severe. If people have mild OCD, they could take advantage of the benefits of OCD, like perfectionism, carefulness and tidiness to improve the quality of study and daily life. OCD is not a totally harmful disorder, if people have a little OCD, they have some stigma which can increase the quality of daily life. 
In conclusion, OCD originates from a risk avoidance process, OCD patients have a survival advantage and a little OCD could make people focused which could improve people's daily life. Although OCD is a mental illness, the public should be also educated to pay attention to the beneficial aspects of OCD.

March 29th 2016 
Nuclear Energy: Future Option of Energy 
Nuclear security has recently become a controversial topic in the world, and many people protest against their government and industry for investing and expanding nuclear energy program to meet the energy demands. However, though nuclear energy is not perfectly safe and reliable contemporarily, I still agree that nuclear energy should be considered to be a good option of energy. Even though some people may argue that horrible accidents and consequence of pollutions arise with construction and operation of nuclear plants, I still believe the technology of nuclear reactors and good policies implemented by government can prevail over the concerns of nuclear security. 
The main reason why I support to consider nuclear energy as a potential option to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels is because future nuclear technology can reduce the possibility of disaster while keep its nature of low greenhouse gases emission during production. Currently, the materials of heat exchange and steam producer of nuclear reactor may not be able to resist high temperature and pressure, and thus they become fragile to have accidents due to high pressure and leak the radiative materials. However, in the future the engineers and scientists will be capable of constructing the reactors that contains heat exchange and fuel rod with high molting point to reduce such concerns. As Shiga (2011) suggests, the next generation nuclear reactor will apply a special material called liquid fluoride thorium in the core of nuclear reactor. Such material can replace water as traditional steam to low the potential of explosions when the accidents take place to heat exchange system. Consequently, the nuclear reactor will be able to endure a longer time during emergency, which provides the technicians more chance to recover the accidents. In addition to the technology that improves the safety, unlike burning coals nuclear reactors naturally do not produce CO2 and other greenhouse gases during its process of energy production. Therefore, in the future, the nuclear energy effectively decreases our dependence of fossil fuels and overcomes its disadvantages of potential harm to the environment. 
As somebody may concern, though this option might have a bright future, the status quos have not been able to reach the target set above to ensure safety of present time. However, those people may not fully acquire the fact of status quos. According to Professor Robert S Bean of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue University, though our current nuclear reactors are not as safe as future model, it is still necessary to be aware that status quos of nuclear technology are healthy enough to continue operating in the present. In the interview with him, he described that despite fact that the current nuclear reactors still remain problems of leaking radiative materials nuclear energy is still under human's control. In his opinion, all of our nuclear reactors for commercial use are under inspections of experts and government regulators. Though for ordinary people they would feel terrified with radiative materials, however, those experienced experts know how to take care them. In other words, as long as experts take care of the materials, the operation of nuclear facility is safe and reliable. Because the nuclear energy is in the cage of multiple inspections and regulation, ordinary people do not have to worry about its safety in the present. Subsequently, society should still trust our present nuclear energy despite we must use it very carefully. 
Aside from bright future and healthy present, we can expand nuclear program if government implements good propagandas and regulations. As I mentioned previously, many people concern about nuclear energy and feel apprehensive because they are not aware of the details about nuclear industry. If we can reduce such concern with political and social reconciliations, nuclear energy will be our ideal choice. In the interview with Professor Bean, he argued as long as the government implements good education and regulation, we can move stably during this transitional time between our present and future. If government conducts good policies and funds the research, the nuclear energy industry will be accepted and developing over time. As a result, the social issue of nuclear energy will be resolved, and nuclear energy will be a good option in the future. 
In conclusion, though nuclear energy recently has many problems and may be costly in terms of construction and safety keeping, it is still considered as a reliable energy source. We can maintain its presence by funding on technology and education. In addition to that, the development of technology will reduce the risk of accidents. In this sense, nuclear energy will no longer be a concern of our society.

"""Global Warming""
Many people tend to think that Global Warming is not important to be worthy of attention. Others think that it is a scientific scam. Global Warming is an important issue because it affects the community in general. In fact, it affects every country and every person in the whole world. The results of Global Warming can affect the world fresh water supply because it is running dry. (Climate change institute) In addition, it can affect the world crops supply because drought rate is increasing. Furthermore, see level is increasing and many countries are loosing their coasts like the Maldives. Individuals can personally participates on preventing Global Warming by choosing clean power, putting limits on factory pollution, invest in green energy, built better communities and better transportation, and by driving smarter cars. Consequences might happen if individuals does not get involved and take action. According to former vice president Al-gore, New York will be under water fifty years from now. Moreover, London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Santa Monica, and many more cities will be under water. Although some readers may object that many previous scientists said that Global Warming is a myth, recent studies shed new light on the evidence of Global Warming, which previous studies had not addressed. Global Warming is happening because of the human negligence on pollution and people must prevent Global Warming by putting carbon dioxide policies, built better community, and use clean energy.
Many people do not understand how Global Warming happens. According to IPCC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, when factories burn fusil fuel, they produce more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which scientists refer to as ""green house gases."" (EPA) when the atmosphere has a lot of carbon dioxide, it makes the stratosphere layer thick. When the stratosphere layer becomes thick, it observes the sun radiation to the earth atmosphere. The normal cycle of the sun radiation is that when the sun radiation inters the earth atmosphere, it hits the ground and flow back to space. When the stratosphere layer is thick, sun radiation inters the earth atmosphere and hit the ground and does not flow back to space because it is trapped by the thick layer which leads to increase in temperature. Fossil fuel burning is not the only reason Global Warming is happening. Car pollution, deforestation, over use of electricity, and water abuse also cause Global Warming.
Global Warming has just recently occurred and it is a new issue to mankind. Global Warming started since the industrial revolution began in the 1800s. Britain was the first country to go in to the coal mining business. Coal burning was the latest affective energy so Britain burned a lot of coal. Scientists claim it started in the 1800 because when research has been done, they discovered that the carbon dioxide concentration level before 1800 was lower than the level after 1800. As it shown on figure 1, carbon dioxide began to increase in 1800 and it expanded since then. According to the EPA, (Environmental Protection Agency), in 2005, global atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were 35% higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution. Scientist have many ways to figure out the temperature of the earth. Tree cores, sediments, and ice cores are the most common ways to find the earth temperature. Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley are the two famous scientists that managed to find the earth temperature 1000 years ago till today. They did it by drilling tree cores. They put their information on a graph and they concluded that the earth temperature went on an expansion from 1890 till now. They called the graph ""The Hokey Stick"" because it looks like a hokey sticks. Figure 2 briefly shows the temperature since 1000 to 2000 and it looks like the temperature expanded on 1900 due to an increase of fusil fuel burning and an increase in carbon dioxide.
What makes the topic ""Global Warming"" controversial is that many people are uncertain about the issue. According to George, Princeton University press, ""Some experts argue that, until the uncertainties in the scientific results are reduced, we should not implement any policies for fear that those policies will put our economy at risk"" (George). Preventing Global Warming requires a lot of sacrifices and there must be a complete change in the way of living. For example, for an individual to participate in preventing Global Warming there should be a change in transportation. Individuals must change their cars to an electric car to reduce carbon dioxide emission. There should be a clean energy power like solar systems. Also, changing and replacing all light bulbs in a house into more efficient light bulbs. Many people are not willing to do the previous requirements because most of the people are not capable of doing so. In addition, applying these requirements hurts the economy and people would want to follow their desires on their interest. There must be a whole different economy. Despite the fact that applying these requirements will hurt the economy in the short-run, there will be greater consequences in the future if no person apply them.
As a result of human negligence on polluting the earth, Global Warming could hurt our community we live in. Global Warming causes extreme weather, rising oceans, food and water resources shortage, human health, war and conflicts. Recently, extreme weather is happening almost every where. Hurricane Katrina was one of the extremist weather catastrophes. The hurricane came to New Orleans, Louisiana and took many human lives with it. Almost 80% of Louisiana was flooded and the overall damages were 81 millions. (Wikipedia.) Global Warming could effect the oceans level by increasing dramatically. As a result of increasing ocean level, many cities will be under water and many human souls will disappear. Global Warming effects the North Pole and South Pole ice glaciers and many polar bears are drown dead because there is no place to rest on a hard stable ground. An increase in temperature will harm the human health because in 2003 there was a severe heat wave that hit Europe and lots of people died. Global Warming could cause wars and conflicts in the future because the water supply is drying and many countries will get involved in wars just to have fresh water supply to survive Global Warming could cause the ecosystem severe damages. According to The UN Environment Program, by 2075 few locally endemic species will survive. Twenty five percent of the Earth's mammals and 12% of bird species will be extinct within the next 30 years (Alternative energy).
There is a lot of evidence that Global Warming is happening and scientist can predict what the consequences are in the future. As vice president Al-gore writes in his book, ""In 2000, scientist dug ice cores from Antarctica to see the differences in the trapped bubbles temperature. The scientist can measure how much CO2 in the bubbles. The data collected was that the bubbles temperature was lower than nowadays.""(Al Gore) in addition, IPCC, which is one of the greatest and most trusted climate agencies in the world, did a report on February 2007 on the decreasing level of snow. It is stated in report that snow has decreased by 7 percent in the North Pole. Furthermore, a second report was published by the IPCC and it is quoted ""The world's average surface temperature has increased by around 0.74 C over the past 100 years (1906 - 2005). A warming of about 0.2 C is projected for each of the next two decades."" There are lots of arguments by the skeptics of Global Warming but they are week against recent studies arguments. What makes the skeptics arguments week is that they don't have sufficient evidence to support their claim. They believe that carbon dioxide emissions do not cause Global Warming. In fact, it is good for the earth. They claim that reducing carbon dioxide will heart the earth. One of the evidence they have is that lowering carbon dioxide will result in low food production like vegetable. Plants grow on high level of carbon dioxide and without high level of carbon dioxide; there will be small production in plant and slow blooming. More carbon dioxide is needed to sustain the plant production.
Another week argument of the skeptic view on Global Warming is that they claim that climate has been changed before and it is part of the earth cycle. For example, one of the skeptics' scientists, Richard Lindzen, said ""Climate is always changing. Ice ages have occurred in a hundred thousand year cycle for the last 700 thousand years, and there have been previous periods that appear to have been warmer than the present despite CO2 levels being lower than they are now."" (Lindzen) most scientists refer to lindzen argument as a week argument because even though planet earth has had a change in global climate, it is not happening right now. Natural change in the earth temperature results from a brighter sun that can make the earth temperature high. In addition, volcano erupts provide more particles into the atmosphere which increases temperature. But it was caused by a natural forcing due to an increase in greenhouse gasses. Green house gasses are now increasing dramatically and that will cause another change in the world cycle.
Although many scientists agree with the topic ""Global Warming"" some believe that it is a scam. According to Joseph Bast, a well known author and the president and CEO of the heart land institution, many reasons that Global Warming is a scam. Firstly, most scientists do not believe that humans are the one who are causing global climate. 17000 scientists signed a document in Oregon science institution that the evidence was not accurate. Secondly, the computer models have no capacity to predict the future. Thirdly, the most important institute (IPCC) did not prove any evidence of Global Warming. Thirdly, around 1200 AD, the earth temperature was warmer than now. So Global Warming will not happen because of human negligence activities. Bast also mentions that putting tax on green house gases it very expensive and the government will not afford this much of money.
From a skeptical perspective, there are many counter arguments towards Global Warming. One of the common arguments skeptics claim is that computer models are not reliable as scientist think. Although Global Warming skeptics believe that computer modeling is the best way to predict the future, they insist that computer models don't have the capacity to model all processes. In addition, the measurements of the modeling are not accurate. For example, computer models predict that the lower level of the atmosphere is wormer than the higher surface of the atmosphere. Recently, they discovered that the models were wrong and the higher level of atmosphere is warmer than the lower level (BBC news). Also, skeptics claim that carbon dioxide measurement rise after an increase in temperature not before. For example, studies show that when scientist did an experiment on ice cores they saw patterns of temperature and carbon dioxide trapped in the bubbles that has increased a thousand intervals. However, they claim that carbon dioxide can only be measured after an increase in temperature not before.
The group which apposes the idea that global warming stems from human causes has a week argument compared to the pros of Global Warming. Firstly, they claim that computer modelings are unreliable. Although I agree with them up to a point, I cannot accept their overall conclusion that computer modeling is a complete junk that is not reliable. Computer modeling will never be perfect and cannot predict the future exactly and specifically. Yet, scientist used computer modeling over the last twenty years and the prediction of the modeling was very accurate and reliable. Secondly, opposing group of Global Warming argue that carbon dioxide can't be measured before the temperatures measurement. This argument is irrelevant to the subject. Although it may show measurements after the temperature, it shows only few years of measurements. The additional carbon dioxide is c of human activities. According to Fred Singer, news person, ""the situation today is dramatically different. The extra CO2 in the atmosphere (35% increase over pre-industrial levels) is from human emissions. Levels are higher than have been seen in 650,000 years of ice-core records, and are possibly higher than any time since three million years ago.""
The reason for the government to put tax on environmental issues is because renewable energy production cost is too high. The need for renewable energy production is being concern because of the wars going on in Iraq and the increasing oil prices. Fortunately, President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 but it took almost four years for the congress to pass. It included tax on solar energy and other renewable energy. Recently, many companies invest in renewable technologies to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions (Hick). Our community needs policies and laws on carbon dioxide emission in order to prevent Global Warming. IPCC is the agency that puts polices on factories that produce a lot of carbon dioxide like burning fossil fuel. The IPCC had sent a bill to the congress for a bill on carbon dioxide emissions. They say that the government should apply these policies to reduce carbon dioxide (New York Times).
When it comes to the topic of ""Global Warming"", one controversial issue has been that whether Global Warming is part of the earth cycle or not. On the one hand, Global Warming pros argue that Global Warming is happening due to human pollution from fusil fuel burning and unclean energy. When fusil fuel is burned, they become carbon dioxide because they are contained mostly carbon and it is increasingly one part per million.. They react with oxygen and produce carbon dioxide. Since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide has been increasing dramatically. On the other hand, opposing group of Global Warming contends that Global Warming is part of the earth cycle. They say that in the past millions years, Global Warming has happened a couples of times and this one is just part of the earth cycle. Others even maintain that Global Warming is a complete political scam. They begin by saying that computer modeling doesn't have the capacity to predict the future. So too, 17000 scientist signed a document in Oregon that confirms that there were no evidence of Global Warming. My own view is that Global Warming is happening and that if there were no policies and laws on carbon dioxide emissions, we will face severe consequences in the future and many lives will be gone because of our negligence.

"P5D1 Argumentative Essay 
April 9, 2015 
Internet Fictions 
	"" <name> , stop reading those stupid online novels and focus on your study, now!"" This is what my mom usually said to me during my high school time. With the spread of the Internet, online novels are becoming more and more popular among modern day people. And based on the huge amount of them, they include nearly all kinds of novels, the romantic stories, the science fictions etc. They usually will be so fascinating to teenagers that teenagers will even spend hours reading them instead of studying. Some people say that those online novels are good to teenagers because those novels can enlarge teenagers' amount of reading. However, I think although these online novels have some advantages to teenagers, they have more disadvantages to teenagers. 
	First of all, reading too much online novels will bring some health problems to teenagers. For instance, I was addicted to those fictions when I was in junior high school. I loved reading them so much that whenever I had time, I would read them. Especially during weekends, I usually would wake up at about 12pm because I did not stop reading the fiction until 3am. This often made me do not have enough sleep and grow some disgusting acnes on my face. What's more, I began reading them through my cellphones during the classes sometimes. Although those classes were not hard for me that time, I had to spend some time reading textbooks and my classmates' notes to learn. And the result was that I have even less time to sleep. Finally I was too tired, so I had a fever and did not get a satisfying grade at the end of that semester. Novel on the Internet usually has millions of words, so finishing reading one novel will spend a lot of time for one person. For teenagers, because they have classes to take and have homework to finish, they usually do not have much free time. Then if they begin reading the story and in order to satisfy their own curiosities and find out the end of story, they will spend time reading the story instead of paying attention to the teachers in front of the classrooms or having a nice dream at night. This will be harmful to both their study and their bodies. 
Apart from the physical health problem, Internet novels will also bring mental health problems. Internet novels are usually about the imaginary worlds, thus reading them too often will let teenagers be unwilling to face the reality. For example, the time-travel fictions are about the protagonist's experience of traveling to the past and possessing someone important at that time. Because the history is a time we cannot experience and those time-travel fictions are often about t traveling back to the past and doing things differently, teenagers will be excited about experiencing the history as an emperor or the General. In those unreal worlds, they do anything they think is useful and ""fortunately"" works every time. However, the huge difference between the fictional world and the toughly real society makes modern day teenagers somewhat be unwilling to accept the real world and makes them be more nervous and difficult to talk to unknowns. Moreover, time-travel fictions often will let the protagonist become ten or more years younger after the time-travel. Then the protagonist will be favored by the parents and elders again. In this case, the teenagers who read them will addict to this kind of fake feeling. But in the real world, those teenagers are not that young so they think they are not loved enough and feel that they do not want to grow up because they still want to be favored. This means that those teenagers are unwilling to face the reality and want to escape from the family and the society responsibilities. 
From the discussion above, I can conclude that online novels are bad to both teenagers' physical health and mental health. They will usually make teenagers not only feel tired all day and hard to concentrate but also be unwilling to face the reality. However, online novels are not totally bad to teenagers. Students can sometimes benefit from them by memorizing and using the vivid descriptions in them. In my opinion, teenagers who are addicted to those online novels are not only because those novels are attracting but also those novels satisfy their daydreams. Hence I think one way to limit the disadvantages of those online novels is to lead teenagers themselves to realize the best way to treat those Internet novels.

"Imagine a world where you could go around the world in an airplane twice or maybe even thrice without stopping or refueling. Imagine paying only about $30-$50 for an airplane ticket. Yes, it might sound too farfetched but it will be possible in the future sooner than one might imagine. Researches and tests are being conducted on the use of solar energy in airplanes and many of the researches show positive results. With the use of solar energy in planes, they no more require jet fuel to power the engines, and by using only the sun's energy to power the engines, in theory one could fly on forever! Solar power is nothing new to mankind. It has been around since a very long time. It has been used in houses for heating purposes for a long time and has been in use for several other purposes. But using solar energy in airplanes is a relatively new concept. Through various researches and studies, it has been found that solar power can be used only in surveillance and research airplanes and not in commercial airplanes. 
Solar energy provides sufficient energy to heat up houses. Or it can even be converted into electrical energy to operate electronic devices. But it just doesn't produce enough horsepower to power large engines, especially large airplane engines that require a lot of horsepower. That is why it is not practical to run large airplanes on solar power. But it is possible to incorporate this technology into smaller and lighter aircraft. NASA has been experimenting on its solar plane, the Pathfinder, which would be used for environmental research and assessment. It would be used to detect forest nutrient status, hurricane effects, coral reef health, and for several other researches. The Pathfinder is also an unmanned airplane that would be used to observe remote and inaccessible places of the earth (NASA, 2014). 
Many researches have concluded that solar powered airplanes can be used for research and observatory purposes. But it just cannot be used in commercial airplanes because commercial airplanes are huge and require an immense amount of power that cannot be attained from solar power. Solar powered research and observatory planes can be used to observe and assess different parts of the globe, especially in remote areas, where human access is very limited. Its true satellites are doing the job at present. But it costs millions of dollars to send a satellite in space. The solar airplanes can orbit the earth at normal flying altitudes nonstop for years, and in theory forever. This is because it requires absolutely no fuel. It utilizes the sun's energy during the day and uses fuel cells, which recharge during the day, at night. These solar planes can be used for communication purposes as well. According to an online article in the Treehugger by Michael Graham Richard (2014), Google is planning to operate a few unmanned solar powered planes that would help in communication and data collection. It would also be used for imaging and mapping. This would greatly reduce the operating costs that would have been otherwise spent on satellites. These planes will fly for years gathering information and is much cheaper to repair and replace them. 
Manned solar airplanes have also been developed. But because of the extreme weight restrictions, only one or two people can travel at a time in a solar airplane. One very revolutionary use of solar airplanes could be in transportation. Though they cannot be used in commercial planes, they can be used as a single seated transportation vehicle. It is very common to rent cars presently. Imagine renting an airplane! The concept of car rentals can be infused with solar planes. Since solar airplanes are single seated, or at max double seated, sometime in the future we could be renting airplanes to go from one place to the other. It would be cheaper too with the increasing fuel prices, as solar planes use absolutely no fuel. And it would definitely be faster. 
So to summarize it all, solar power can only be used in research and observatory airplanes and not in commercial airplanes, though it can be used as a single seated transporter in the future. Solar airplanes consume no fuel, therefore it would greatly impact the economy as well as cause the environment no harm. It is therefore a technology of the future.

language cannot evidence everthing 
Researcher shows the language is not the most important part when we do a conversation. My partner do not agree with it, he thinks language fits one hundred percent when international students talk with local students and that why international students need to practice speaking firstly when we learning in America. 
However, My topic is based on the strategy of international students how to talk with local students. The ""strategy"" is a key world of my topic, language is only one part when we doing a conversation, it means that language is not one hundred percent. In other words except language there are also another elements can help or affect conversation. My topic serve for conversation this semester, any way just useful to talking is well. On the other hand, The material was searched in internet by myself clarifies that barriers from language that just represents 7 percent of what we communicate, which means even we cannot speak like the native speaker, nothing should be worried too much, we still can live and lean independently. 
My father's experience of traveling is a good example about aspect of life. He ever did a honeymoon journey with my mother to Bali. At the beginning of the traveling I am very doubt about them because my parents never learned English before. My father just ordered hotel and air ticket of Bali in China. I asked the whole traveling when my parents ho back home. My father told me the honeymoon in Bali is exciting, my mother is satisfied to Bali's beech and fresh air. However I am not interested about it. My attention is why someone has no ability of English can live in Bali happily. He told me language is not necessary or just fit small part in conversation. He also said body language is more important than English to himself, these actions can show what he want, what he want to present. After that, I believe language could not limit conversation totally. My father experience may is not a symbol example because not anyone can be a good performer like my father. However, we can see body language is survived because group of deformed man use sign language to show what they want.

"Homosexual Argumentative Essay 
Purdue University 
(The Final Draft) 
Homosexual Argumentative Essay 
Homosexual is a controversial topic so far. There are a lot of organizations that favor advancing homosexuals' rights. Similarly, we could hear some news about anti-gay parade from all around world. After I did lots of research about this topic, I think people should understand and respect the homosexuals rather than being anti-homosexuals. I will demonstrate my opinion in sight of health infection of homosexuals, what influences homosexuals' sexual orientation and social problems caused by homosexuals. 
First of all, homosexuals are not different from anyone as normal humans. They just have same-sex partners. Of course, some may say the existence of homosexuals would increase the rate of some disease infections, which demonstrates homosexuals is a high-risk group of HIV and some other sexually transmitted diseases. However, the infections occurring is not because of their promiscuities but because of the way of intercourse of the homosexuals, which they have sex in anus. In addition, referring to CDC (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention), if homosexuals take protection when they have sex, the rate of being infected will be decreasing a lot. Homosexuals can choose less risky sexual behaviors, such as oral sex that is much safer, rather than anal sex that has high risk of HIV transmission. What's more, using consistent condom is 76% effective in preventing new HIV infections. As a result, if the homosexuals take appropriate prevention measures, the risk will be significantly reduced and even as the as the straights. The homosexuals are not promiscuous as how people consider (Dr. <name> , personal communication, March, 2015.). Actually, they have the same sexual attitude with straight people. In average, homosexual people just have one more sexual partner than straight people. 
Secondly, homosexuals do not have chance to choose their orientations because they are inborn. Based on what Dr. <name> said, homosexuality is resulted by biological factors, such as hormones and genes. Their genes determine their sexual orientations. Homosexuality is born not made. Once they were born in gay, they almost always remain homosexuals. If you are a heterosexual it is impossible for you to fall in love with same-sex person because your sexual orientation. If someone compels you to get married with a same-sex person, how is your feeling? Similarly, homosexuals will get the same painful feeling if they have to get married with opposite-sex persons. In addition, the part of environment factors does not matter in sexual orientation determination because there is no stable statistics being found to show the relationship between homosexuality and environments. It's hard and rare to change their sexual orientation as they growing up. Thus, homosexual is not a sin. People should not condemn them. 
Lastly, if people do not accept them and consider that homosexuals are monsters, it would cause many tragedies of society. The first family problem is ""xinghun"", which means ritual marriage reported in China's gay fake marriage (Joanna Chiu, 2013). Because of cultural background, the generality tends to be conservatism in the Eastern traditions compared with Western culture. Consequently, it is difficult for parents to accept the truth that their children are homosexuals. Some homosexuals will get marriaged with lesbians to cheat their parents but they live apart with their spouses. What is more, many homosexuals who were not attracted by opposite sex at all, they chose to get married and have kids only because they were afraid of disappointing their parents. Both of these behaviors lead them to live in misery. In case their parents eventually find the fact, they may be more disappointed, won't they? The second one is that the insights from others will cause some young homosexuals who are still in school to suicide. The rate of committing to suicide for homosexual teens is five times more than heterosexual teens. The incident of Tyler Clementi is a case in point. Tyler's roommate installed a webcam on Tyler's computer and spied on Tyler. His roommate found that Clementi kissed with his male partner and posted text to state that Tyler is a gay on the Internet. Finally, Tyler Clementi jumped into George Washington river to death due to this malicious bullying. Besides the instance of Tyler, many other homosexual teens are tempted in school. A lot of suicide incidents of homosexual teens are reported because people around them do not accept them and think that they are heterodox. This argument around homosexual teens gives them stress and influences their mental health. They commit to suicide due to their failure to resist police pressures. 
All in all, homosexuals are as the same as anyone who is living in this planet. They are not different. If they take proper measures to protect themselves when they have sex, it hardly infected by their partners who are the carries of SIDs or HIV. Homosexuals are innocent for their sexual orientation since they are inborn. It is offered by nature and God. They do not have to change because you cannot ask someone normal who is sinless and does not make any mistakes to change something. It is an unfair treatment for them. For the sake of avoiding the tragedies of life like Tyler Clementi, people should be considerate to homosexuals. Even if you still cannot accept them for some reasons, please do not sneer at their sexual orientations. Conclusively, homosexuals need to be respected and understood and people should give them free living space and tolerance.

"Chinese Eating Behaviors 
	Obesity becomes a global problem and people have to treat it seriously. The reason that many people become fat is they have unhealthy eating behaviors such as skipping breakfast, eating fast-food a lot, etc. Today, many people believe that those unhealthy eating behaviors mostly happen in the developed countries. However, as a person who was born in China, I say that Chinese people have a lot of bad eating behaviors and a lot of them are overweight in today's world. Since many Chinese people become rich now, they eat a lot of snacks today. Also, because of the growing of fast food restaurants, Chinese people eat much fast food due to its convenience. Furthermore, grandparents in China provide their grandchildren too much food so the grandchildren have the bad eating behavior about eating too much. According to all the claims above, it is easy to imagine that a lot of people are gaining weight in China right now and they are suffering from obesity. 
	Now you know the generally idea about my essay, let's talk about what unhealthy eating behaviors that Chinese people have. 
	First, Chinese people become rich so they buy too many snacks to eat. There is no doubt that Chinese economy is growing rapidly nowadays. And because of that, Chinese people have more money to consume. Nevertheless, most of snacks are not very healthy to people, some of them can even hurt people if they are ate too much. Some people may argue this statement that there are many poor people in China still have not enough food to eat, so obviously they won't have money to buy snacks. It is true that plenty of people are still poor in China, but as I said, Chinese economy is growing, most of people in Chinese poor areas still have money to get food to eat. However, for the snack they choose, they prefer to buy cheap snacks such as snack noodle and spicy bar. Those kinds of food made mainly with starch and they contains excess sodium so they are bad for people's healthy. Overall, no matter where people live in China at present, they all have great chances to intake superfluous snacks. 
	Second, Chinese people eat fast food a lot today and they become obesity. According to Tony 2011, Chinese people have less time to make food on their own since they are very busy. Therefore, a huge amount of fast food restaurants appear to meet people's demand. According to Michelle 2013, ""The Chinese fast-food industry is now the fifth-largest in the world"", ""KFC opened its 4,000th restaurant in China"". All of these evidences show that Chinese people love fast food and they have a huge demand on it. Michelle 2013 also stated that ""KFC, and other brands like Mc Donald's, are also being held responsible for a growing epidemic of obesity in the nation of 1. 3 billion. And there may be a link between China's breakneck development and its weight gain"". It is possible that Chinese obesity has a strong relationship with the growing of fast food restaurant. 
	Last but not least, According to Jingxiong, Rosenqvis, Huishan, Greiner, Guangli & Sarkadi 2006, grandparents have huge influence on forming their grandchildren's eating behaviors, mostly in a bad way. Also according to the interview from my mom <name>, personal communication, October 31, 2015, grandparents like to make a too much food for their grandchildren so their grandchildren become fat. One of my older brother was raised by my grandparents. He was fed almost five meals a day because my grandparents said they didn't want their grandchildren feel hungry at all. They also said they like their grandchildren look fat because they think fat mean healthy. Finally he is over 242 pounds now. He eats a lot of food but he still says he is hungry. I think the reason is he was fed too much when he was young and he couldn't change his eating behaviors anymore. At this time, some people would argue that they don't think grandparents play a bad role on forming teenagers' eating behaviors. Actually grandparents make a lot of good food for people and let them eat healthily. Even though grandparents may make healthy food for their grandchildren, that still doesn't change the fact that they provide too much food for young people. The more food you eat, the more calories you will intake. Finally you still gain weight, whether the food is healthy or not. 
	In short, Chinese eating behaviors is not healthy right not due to the taking of snacks, fast food, and the impact from grandparents. And because of these bad eating behaviors, many people become fat and they need to change their behaviors as soon as possible. My suggestion is avoid fast food, eat less snacks because they are not necessary. Instead try to eat Chinese traditional food since they contains more vegetables, less oil and red meat. Finally we should teach a lesson for our grandparents. We can show them the picture that how bad eating behaviors affect people's health and teach them how to avoid that. Also we should tell them that fat doesn't mean strong or healthy, in fact fat will create many health issue, sometimes even kill people.

"Athletic training 
Argumentative essay(First Draft) 
Introduction 
	Sports plays a more and more essential role nowadays. To perform better in the matches, there is no doubt that athletes need to train more scientifically in order to increase their competitiveness. For example, some parents may force their children to train at really young ages, which means the children can train longer period compared with their opponents. Some athletes decided to train more intensively or frequently in order to increase their training efficiency. Thus, people may wonder about the best way to train in case of overtraining, which may have adverse effects. It is obvious that understanding the different consequence of training at different ages is of great benefits for athletes to avoid overtraining. What's more, it is important for ordinary people to know it too because we also need to have physical exercise. For instance, we need to consider whether it is good to have physical exercise when we are above 50 years old. I think there are specific types of training and specific amount of training for athletes at different ages to avoid overtraining. 
	Young age training 
	Generally speaking, it is not good for athletes to train their body heavily when they are too young. According to Carole De Haven (2014), If kids are less than 10 years old, training their bodies is under risk. This is because their bodies haven't grown properly, any kind of heavy training, like lifting, may increase the risk of getting injury on their growth plates. But according to Strength Training in Children and Adolescents: Raising the Bar for Young Athletes?, it is beneficial for children to train their strength as long as they are under professional guidance ( Dahab & Mc Cambridge, 2009,p.223-226). However, I think the main reason for this difference is because the ""professional guidance"" cannot be achieved easily. Most athletes cannot promise that they can have professional guidance all the time. Even the most talented kids who have the best coaches are under risk as well, and there is no need for them to run the risk. Thus, it is generally not good for kids to have heavy training. The best training for kids, according to Carole De Haven(2014), is to learn skills related to the sports that they are interested. But their parents still need to take caution about overtraining. If the kids are overtrained, they may lose their interest about the sports, which may negatively influence their athletes career. 
Teenager training 
	According to Carole De Haven(2014), the best age for athletes to have heavy training is the time when they reach puberty, which is about 13 to 14 years old. Kids can start heavy training at this time because their bodies are relatively mature. However, if an athlete experienced significant growth in a short period of time during his puberty, it is still not good for him to have intense physical training because his body is uncoordinated. What's more, coaches still need to pay much attention to overtraining. Even though teenagers' bodies are ready for the heavy trainning now, overtraining may still cause a huge problem to athletes, both physically and mentally. According to Avoid Overtraining in Young Athletes, it is hard to measure whether an athlete is overtrained because there are so many variables involved in. As a result, coaches need to set the training schedule properly and pay attention to their athletes states by using stuff like questionnaire( Rearick, Creasy, & Buriak, 2011,p.25). 
Training for athletes who are about to retire 
	For athletes who are about to retire, the training methods are quite different compared with teenagers. For example, Michael Jordan kept a really good competition form until 40 years old. According to Carole De Haven(2014), this kind of athlete might only have some simple training instead of heavy physical training because his body is not as young as before. Heavy training may increase the pressure to their body and potentially destroy the rest of their careers. The training method he might use would be like running or other non-heavy training, which may not increase the risk of getting injury. 
Older age training 
	It seems athletes' careers generally may end at about 40 years old. However, athletes, or even ordinary people may still want to train their body even when they are above 50. According to Physical activity and public health in older adults: Recommendation from the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association, since the main reason for these people to train is to keep fit and healthy instead of gaining competitiveness and most of older adults have health problems, to take simple exercises is do beneficial for their physical condition. Based on their health condition, they can gradually increase the intensity of exercises they take to make them healthier(Nelson, M. E., Rejeski, W. J., Blair, S. N., Duncan, P. W., Judge, J. O., King, A. C., ... Castaneda-Sceppa, C., 2011,p.1094-1100). Carole De Haven(2014) also stated that physical training for older people is beneficial as long as they have proper guidance. However, I think it is generally not good for older people to have heavy physical trainnig for the same reason like kids: the professional guidance is hard to achieve, and there is no need for them to run the risk of hurting their body since their bodies are not on the same level like before. 
Conclusion 
	There is no doubt that using different methods of training at different ages is of huge benefits for athletes. There are different standard and types of training that can be beneficial for athletes' training efficiency and health. Based on what we have discussed, I strongly recommend all athletes to pay much attention to their training at different ages.

It's Time to Remove the Steering Wheel 
	When I was on vacation in California, I had a list of things I wanted to see. None of those items were a self-driving car. One night, I was on my way home when I was stopped at an intersection in Mountain View and that's when I saw one of the most inspiring things in my life. I saw a small white car drive by in front of me. What was so unique about it is, there was no steering wheel controlling the car. It was driving itself and inside were two Google employees doing absolutely nothing but enjoying the ride. 
There was only thing going on in my mind at that point of time: 'I want one.' Not only me, but I'm sure hundreds of thousands of drivers are waiting to get their hands on one. The Self-driving car wouldn't benefit just the drivers but also passengers and pedestrians. This nearly covers most of the people in the United States. The real question is, are we, the people of the United States, ready for self-driving cars? Drivers would say they aren't, simply because they wouldn't trust technology with their lives. Paid drivers would lose their jobs affecting the economy. Despite the drawbacks, I still believe we are ready as we ever will be and that this is the right time to release such a technology to the public for consumer use. 
A Self-Driving car is a vehicle that heavily relies on sensors to navigate itself through its environment without any human input (""Self-Driving Car Project""). One of the many purposes of having a self-driving car is to make individuals dependent on a driver become independent. Google has been developing the self-driving car since 2009 and since then there have been great improvements in the technology (""Self-Driving Car Project""). In October 2015, Tesla Motors released their innovative solution: Autopilot (The Tesla Motors Team, ""Your Autopilot has arrived""). Even though these technologies are being developed at a rapid rate, there are no set laws to govern these self-driving cars. 
	Google has been developing the self-driving car with the aim to reduce the number of accidents on the road. Every year, there are more than 5. 5 million accidents in the United States. As the safety standards increased, Google pushed these vehicles out onto public roads. They began testing these cars on highways and public streets to see how well they respond to their environment. Since the beginning of the project, all of the self-driving cars tested by Google, have been involved in only 14 accidents collectively. All of these accidents were caused due to human error which is the main cause for accidents. Google maintains that there was no fault made by the self-driving cars. This goes to show that we have already started adapting the self-driving car onto our roads safely. 
	Google isn't the only company testing self-driving cars on the road. Tesla Motors is a premium automotive company who is also working on this technology. In October 2015, they released a new feature for their cars: Autopilot. Autopilot is a software that uses sensors and cameras to maintain its lane, control its speed and auto-park. It can also detect oncoming vehicles and avoid collisions by swerving out of the way. Although Autopilot isn't as well developed as Google's self-driving car, it still has features which are already saving lives on the road. Multiple online reports are claiming that the vehicle is saving lives by avoiding collisions on the streets (Soper, ""Tesla's new autopilot technology prevents crash on slick Seattle road""). Videos on social media show the car automatically adjusting its course to avoid collision with another car on the highway. This goes to show that the technology is already being used by people and has already started having an impact in the way we drive. 
Now that we know it has started making an impact, let's look into a specific example. For many, the commute to work and back is a long tiring process which involves hours being spent in long lines of traffic. Instead of paying attention to the road, self-driving cars will give you the opportunity to utilize that time do something more productive. It can also help reduce the stress levels of many when they get stuck in traffic. Increased stress levels and fatigue can lead to accidents on the road. In this case, the driver is clearly at fault. However, when the human element is removed what will happen? 
	The big question everyone asks when an accident occurs is, 'whose fault is it?' The only way we know how to settle this case is by turning to the law. However, there are no laws written regarding self-driving cars. In an accident, who's to blame? The human inside the vehicle or the vehicle itself? As of today, the only law regarding self-driving vehicles is that it can only be used for development and testing and not for consumer use. We may not have laws ready at this moment to adapt self-driving cars immediately but soon we will have something to help maintain decorum. New laws are being written every day and Google is already behind many Governments to allow self-driving cars in their states. I believe that these new laws will also hold automotive industries responsible since they are the ones making the cars. 
	We are already seeing the impact automation can bring to the automotive industry. Automation is killing jobs and reducing the employment all over the country. With self-driving cars being added to the equation not only manufacturers but also taxi drivers, truck drivers, delivery services, and personal drivers will lose their jobs. As of today there are 233,700 taxi drivers and chauffeurs (""Occupational Outlook Handbook - Taxi Drivers and Chauffeurs""). 
However, drivers are still human beings who make mistakes. Mistakes on the road can cost lives and the main aim of self-driving cars is to reduce the number of accidents that are taking place. Soon we will be able to save hundreds of lives not to mention their money involved when self-driving cars are released on the roads. We will never be ready until we push our boundaries and start bringing them out onto the roads. Google has already been successfully testing these cars in Mountain View, California with very few incidents. In the time to come, the technology is meant to get better, reducing the number of total accidents on road. Tesla's Autopilot is already on the roads with people claiming to have avoided accidents thanks to this new technology. In a world full of advanced technology, it only seems fair that everyone has the same amount of freedom and independence when it comes to transportation. Self-driving cars will allow many more people who were dependent on a driver to become independent. Self-Driving cars are going to help save time and allow us to become more productive during our commute to work and back. In my opinion we are ready to bring this new technology onto the roads. We are as ready as we ever will be.

"Argument Essay: 
Common People Needn't to Worry About Radiation in Daily Life 
P5D3 
May 1st, 2015 
With the occurrence of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster as well as increasing amount of wireless communication devices appearing in daily life, public is concerning the safety issue of radiation more than ever. The frequent reports related to radiation on news media and health magazines make some people believe certain severe radiation accidents are happening around them and start taking various measures they trust to prevent radiation. Radiation, especially the background radiation does exist around us every second and does influence our body, but in decades, we're almost safe and don't need to worry about the safety of radiation. Radiation in daily life won't harm health as long as we don't intentionally access nuclear facilities without protections or instructions. This passage will cover the questions that the category of different radiation in daily life and their strength, the possibility of they harming health and how, and related protective measures if necessary. 
All kinds of radiation on the earth can be divided into two categories, ionizing and non-ionizing, by the level of its energy strength. Non-ionizing radiation has less strength than ionizing. Non-ionizing radiation has a milder biological effect. When biological tissue is exposed, ionizing radiation may cause displacement to the atoms in the cells of tissue while the non-ionizing can't. When this process happens on the DNA of cells, cells may function mistakenly. And when those mistakes accumulate to the amount that cells can't not repair, disorders may occur in our body. The severe disorders such as cancers may appear when this goes serious (Schweitzer, J. F., & Zhang, Z., 2015). On the other hand, the strength of non-ionizing radiation is not strong enough to make the atoms displaced in the cells of exposed tissue. Both kinds of radiation can heat up tissue as well as generate electric current in it and the effect of these two processes of the non-ionizing is slighter because of its weaker energy. Ionizing radiation includes particle stream and high energy EMR, electromagnetic radiation. Non-ionizing radiation is mainly made up of low energy EMR. 
Although ionizing radiation can make atoms in tissue displaced and modify our DNA sequence, which means may cause biological variation on us human and our offspring, it's not such terrible at most of time. On the earth, ionizing radiation usually comes from artificial nuclear facilities, nuclear medical equipment and background radiation. The radiation of the first and the third ones are low level ionizing radiation while some of the second one is med or med-low level. Despite of the occurrence of the Chernobyl disaster and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the nuclear facilities are strictly guarded and insulated. They may emit very minor dose which is even smaller than that of background radiation and this mostly won't influence people and environment nearby. Similar to nuclear facilities, medical nuclear equipment in hospitals are insulated from public, too. For the patients who need to use the equipment, it's no need to worry about taking exceeded dose. In most cases, doctors will evaluate conditions of patients and make sure the radiation dose they take is under safe limits. Additionally, an interesting fact is, background radiation is the radiation people is concerning about least, but it makes most dose common people take. Background radiation is made up of external background radiation and internal background radiation. The external radiation is emitted from outer space and the radiative material in air, water, soil and rock. The internal radiation come from the radiative atoms in the air, water and food we take in. The annual dose background radiation puts on a person nearly equals to the half does of taking an X ray or CT scan (American Nuclear Society, 2009). Background radiation is also almost safe because we human have taken it for a long time, from when we were monkeys. Of course taking large amount of high level ionizing radiation in short time certainly harms body. However, the case of low level ionizing radiation is unsure. The low level one certainly lead some biological effects in exposed tissue. Biological effects are the biological changes happened in tissue when it's influenced by external factors. The biological meaning and significance of those effects are ambiguous (Karipidis et al., 2007). In short periods of time they're harmless, but their long term results are unknown. The conclusion about whether low level ionizing radiation is good or bad to health over long term hasn't been discovered.. 
Similar to ionizing radiation, the safety issue of non-ionizing radiation is always questioned these years. The radiation is majorly EMR, which is mostly emitted by communication devices. The public is scared by various antenna set in cities and the amount as well as the function of wireless devices we use nowadays. High level non-ionizing radiation can harm body by the intense heat and electric current generated in tissue. This is same as the way how microwave oven works. The biological effects of low level non-ionizing radiation include slightly heating up, generating small electric current and other uncertain changes. The temperature rising and electric current is almost fine, but just like low level ionizing radiation, the biological meaning of other changes are vague (Karipidis et al., 2007). Scientists tend to believe that normally non-ionizing radiation in daily life won't influence or harm health in short time, about 20 to 50 years. But no one can affirm there's no harm over long period such as centuries. The long term safety issue of non-ionizing radiation is still in research. 
Although radiation continuously exists around us from when we were monkeys, we're almost safe and there is no need to worry about radiation in decades from now. As long as not intentionally approach nuclear facilities, radiation won't harm our health. High level ionizing and non-ionizing radiation which can harm health instantly is very rear to us. Most people will never meet it in their life. Low level ionizing and non-ionizing radiation which exist in daily life won't hurt us in decades, but their influences to health over long term are still in research. The researches about radiation's health issue are always costly and slow because of large amount of sample needed, being influenced easily by many factors and difficulty of processing strict control experiment. Although with these difficulties, the related researches are urgent and significant since low leveling radiation may influence human's offspring and other important aspects.

"P5D1 Argumentative essay 
April 16th, 2015 
Should Everyone Develop His or Her Leadership Skills? 
In recent years, universities are paying growing attentions on students' leadership experiences. Statistics shows that students who have more leadership experiences have more advantages in admission processes. Though plenty of students have a opposite point of view: ""Some students like in engineering major should not focus on developing leadership skills but professional experiences, otherwise they can hardly find a job in a terrible employment status,"" I believe that leadership experiences are far more important than professional knowledge. 
""Surely not every are potentially a leader,"" Professor <name> said in his open course, ""but it not means that you are not required to develop leadership skills because before being a leader of a team, you need to be the leader of your life."" Although engineering major students are not required to do management jobs after their graduation, they do need to manage their time and their life. As we all know, a good leader usually has a lot of qualities like honesty, excellent communication skills, sense of humor, confidence, creativity and so on. These qualities are also the key factors to success for engineering students. For example, Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, was a computer science student in Harvard University. However it's rarely acknowledged that he is also a psychology major student that he has learned large amount of knowledge about humanity such that he is versatile person instead of a programming nerd. Without inspiration, creativity and communications skills, it's impossible for Mark Zuckerberg to build Facebook and being one of the richest people in the world. 
Despite the factor that engineering student need leadership experience to refine their life, they may convert their jobs to managements positions for some reason. It's pretty fair that an outstanding engineer is promoted to a manager position and takes in charge of a whole team. In this kind of situations, a manager lack of leadership skills would lead the whole team to failure. Leadership is the way you lead the team to success. ""Radically different styles --- think Steve Jobs, Bill Campbell, and Andy Grove -- can all lead to great outcomes, "" Ben Horowitz wrote in his book The Hard Thing about Hard Things, ""Perhaps the most important attribute required to be a successful CEO is leadership."" Leadership in this kind of view is an approach to success more than a quality. Just as the three world-famous CEOs mentioned in Ben's book, all of them are first engineers, and then CEOs that their successes are all based on both professional skills and leadership skills. 
However there do have some opposite examples to support the leadership unnecessary theory. For instance, Stephen William Hawking, well-known scientist who suffered ALS for a long period that he even cannot talk and move. His extraordinary professional knowledge leads him to success without leadership stuffs. Usually these situations always happened on some outstanding scientists that they seldom contact and interact with other people and the only job they do is researching and developing. For these people, spending time on developing so-called leadership skills is a waste of time and extremely meaningless that they would rather spend time on professional skills to finding breakthrough in their research. 
As examples mentioned above, both professional skills and leadership can bring you success. Nevertheless, leadership seems significant general situations and only regarded unnecessary in some extreme cases. Generally speaking, being a technology nerd and lacking of leadership skills usually result in a trouble. Leadership is not only the ability to lead a team to success, but also a kind of quality to build a rich and colorful life.

"Extended Argument ""Violent Video Games""
Imagine that a husband and his wife are walking home after a night out on the town when all of a sudden a dark figure approaches the couple, pulls out a fully loaded revolver, and with the simple twitch of his finger a bullet is engraved into the head of the man; leaving the woman in a paralyzing fear and open to a world of pain and agony, or even worse, sexual abuse and murder. Violence in media such as violent video games, and TVs, is blamed for such this case. It is the constant picture of violence that today's ""entertainment"" methods into the minds of its viewers that can occasionally have an impact on their mentality, and even their actions. As a result, violent video games had an increased impact on society, and have received more and more attention from the media. Video games have many effects on children. Many people have speculated that video games have a direct influence on how violent a person becomes. The negative repercussions of excessive game play seem to outweigh the positive. Do violent video games lead to a real violence? Do violent video games cause behavior problems? In this essay, I will analyze the arguments made about violent video games.
Some people believe that there are some benefits of video games. Studies by leading researchers have shown that video games have many benefits: Games help children who are ill or have injuries. Absorption in a game distracts the mind from pain and discomfort. Many hospitals are encouraging children and others undergoing painful treatments to play games, Griffiths a professor at Nottingham University wrote in a medical journal that playing games could help children with attention deficit disorders. Research indicates that the children could gain social skills; many medical departments are using computer games as a form of physiotherapy. Games help people who are recovery from physical injuries gain motor skills and coordination too, Video games are known to improve hand-eye co-ordination and help players gain many skills, Games create team players and hone social skills too, Games are known to enhance creativity and inculcate a taste for graphics, design and technology, many games improve language and math skills as players have to move at a great speed along with the heroes of the game. ""Videogames have also been used to improve children's health care. Several games have been developed specifically for children with chronic medical conditions. One of the best-studied is an educational game called 'Packy and Marlon'. 25 This game was designed to improve self-care skills and medical Relationships between playing violent electronic games and negative behaviors and emotions may never be proven to be causal by the strictest standard of ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" (Griffiths, 2002. p. 47). According to Mark Griffiths ""Videogames can be used when examining individual characteristics such as self-esteem, self-concept, goal-setting and individual differences"" (Griffiths, 2002. p. 47). Video and computer games help children gain self-confidence and many games are based on history, city building, and governance and so on. Such games indirectly teach children about aspects of life on earth. And games teach players problem solving, motivation, and cognitive skills. Most games inspire players to strive and reach more difficult levels presenting challenges at each stage.
""Even though violent video games are associated with negative behavior, they are believed to be beneficial teaching tools for purposes of motivation as well as learning process ""(Lachlan, Smith & Tamborini, 2005). Video games are believed to be hard, an aspect that calls for extra thinking in order to generate practical solutions. Most video games tend to challenge children right to the edge of their capacities. In an attempt to score more points, children are forced to think harder thereby enhancing their psychological capacity. Lachlan, Smith and Tamborini (2005) argue that games have the potential to reduce stress among children. They distract the minds of children from discomforts and pain that characterize normal life. Another positive aspect associated with games as pointed out by proponents is that they can be beneficial to children suffering from attention disorders. ""Children try as much as possible to move with the speed of the heroes in a game, and as a result the speed with which their minds come up with practical solutions is enhanced ""(Anderson, Gentile & Buckley, 2007). Games also have the capacity to boost the confidence of a child. This is due to the fact that most of them are divided into various levels. Every player in a game puts all of his or her effort in an attempt to reach and go beyond more difficult levels than other players. ""Therefore, when a child successfully completes most of these levels his or her morale is boosted ""(Anderson, Gentile & Buckley, 2007).
Figure 1: This picture explains how video games increase problem solving and creativity.
According to Paul Tassi ""In many fields from medicine to the military, video games are being used as training tools to help develop specific skills and ""Gamification"" of many jobs increases productivity, creativity and motivation"". A study found that kids who played video games scored 23% higher in creative tests involving tasks such as drawing pictures and writing stories.
Although video games have many disagreements, and my side of the argument is against violent video games. Violent video games become more popular and attractive for most children, causing aggressive behavior among children. Many scientist and psychologists believed that violent video games lead to aggressive behavior, ""modern day psychologists believe that video games, which contain a large percentage of violent scenes, tend to disrupt the normal psychological development of children leading to violent behavior"" (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Even though it is widely believed that violent video games have a higher propensity to causing violent behavior among young people, the main question remains whether young persons who spend most of their time watching these games become more violent as compared to those who do not watch the games. The issue regarding violent video games and development of violent behavior among children has resulted in a significant divide among parents and teachers in addition to psychologists. Based on the fact that children tend to imitate what they see other people doing their tendency to take on violent behavior from violent video games is significantly high. ""Over 130 studies have been conducted on over 130,000 participants around the world"" (Anderson et al., 2010). These studies show that violent video games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), and aggressive behavior. Violent games also decrease helping behavior and feelings of empathy for others.
Overall the facts there are some people believe that violent video games cannot lead to violent behavior ""Even though a large proportion of society argues that violent video games cannot lead to violent behavior among children, the fact that these games tremendously disrupt the normal psychological development of children cannot be refuted"" (Anderson, Gentile & Buckley, 2007). Many scientists believed that children imitate everything they play or see in violent video games, which cause violent behavior, and lead to a series problem in the world. Many studies have approved that children imitate the violence they see, and show more aggressive behavior with greater exposure to violence. Some children accept violence as a way to handle problems.
Although some games have educational content, many of the most popular games, such as GTA, and Call of Duty, emphasize negative themes, and violent visuals, and promote: ""the killing of people or animals, the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol, criminal behavior, disrespect for authority and the law, sexual exploitation and violence toward women, racial, sexual, and gender stereotypes, and foul language, obscenities, and obscene gestures"" (aacap, 2011).
Figure 3: This graph shows the effectives of playing violent video games.
Children and young adults can become very involved and even obsessed with video games. Spending large amounts of time playing these games can lead to: ""poor social skills, time away from family time, school-work, and other hobbies, lower grades and reading less, exercising less, and becoming overweight, and aggressive thoughts and behaviors"" (aacap, 2011).
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado witnesses a violent bloody shooting in April 20, 1999 by two teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. The deadly assault they carried out killed 13 and wounded 23 people before killing themselves. (Salt Lake City Police Department). Although we don't know the motives why they did what they did, but investigators found that they both enjoy playing violent video games. Their favorite video game was called ""Doom"", which is bloody, and shoots them up type game. There is a study done by the US Secret Service found that ""one-eighth (12%) of 41 individuals involved in high school shootings attacks showed an interest in violent video games"". (Angeline Duran, 2008).
""Research, as denoted by Sadock, Kaplan and Sadock "" (2007), has also revealed that cases of accidents committed by young persons as a result of overexposure to violent video games have been on the rise. ""For instance, a case was reported in Egypt whereby a boy who had allegedly stabbed his brother with a knife was asked why he did it. Innocently, the child replied that he had seen the same action in the ""house of the dead"", a video game that is presumed to contain numerous violent scenes ""(Sadock, Kaplan & Sadock, 2007). ""It has also been revealed that as compared to girls, the tendency of boys to develop violent behavior as a result of violent video games is higher"" (Cichirillo & Chorry-Assad 2005). ""Psychologists argue that boys whose capacity in education is lower become more violent as compared to those whose ability in education is excellent ""(Anderson, Gentile & Buckley, 2007).
Based on the fact that psychological development is usually at its peak during the early stages of life, exposing children to high levels of violence either in TV shows or violent video games is detrimental (Beaver, 2011). A violent scene sets the mind of a child such that even though the scene may contain high levels of violence, the scene appears alright to him or her. Children continually absorb and internalize what they see. As a result the violent character of a child that may have been lying dormant may be become activated.
Lachlan, Smith and Tamborini (2005) point out that despite the fact that there is considerable evidence supporting the view that violent video games result to distorted perception of violence among children thereby leading to hostility, attempts to ensure that children are not allowed to play violent video games have time and again been successfully challenged in court. Most of the parents continue encouraging their children to take part in these games oblivious of the dangers they are exposing them to.
It can therefore be concluded that even though a large group of people believe that video games cannot disrupt the psychological development of a young person, it has been revealed that children tend to imitate and internalize almost everything they are exposed to. Many facts showed that violent video games cause behavior problems and can lead to a real violence, such as, Columbine High School, and that case reported in Egypt. However, there are many video games have educational content, and help to increase problem solving and creativity, but most of them have negative themes, and violent visuals, and promote, such as, ""the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol, and criminal behavior"". In addition, there are some solutions to avoid children from video games, checking the entertainment software ratings board to learn about the game, set a limit time of playing for children, and play the game before you buy it to see if it's content violent.

The Integration of E-commerce with Physical Retailing 
In January 2015, the first Amazon physical store have opened quietly. The store is not located in the Manhattan core area where was mentioned at The Wall Street Journal, but opened at Purdue University in Indiana where I am studying in right now. Amazon, as everyone knows, is currently one of the largest online retailers around world. According to IBISWorld, Amazon.com Inc. own 18.8% market share of e-commerce industry in the U.S., from here we can see that amazon have great influence and power in this industry. So when amazon was trying to develop physical store, I want to know whether developing offline store is trend for e-commerce or not. After the research, I found that the integration of online store with physical store have a promising outlook, because there are many advantages of this combination that attract online retailer to develop offline store, they are reasons why the top e-commerce brands are integrating with physical retail. 
From the article A Framework for Cyber-Enhanced Retailing: Integrating E-Commerce Retailing with Brick-and-Mortar Retailing that written by James Otto and Q Chung, the combination of e-commerce with physical retailing would retain a lot of advantages of online store. Convenience, what is one of the most important factor why people love online shopping. Normally, customers can only come and buy when physical store open, but if you go to online store, you could watching your favorite TV show in your bed and buying anytime you want or interacting with customer service people and getting questions. Moreover, online store can generally offer a larger inventory of items for sale because they are not constrained by physical retail space. They can also offer their products to anyone with access to the Internet, traditional physical retailing are generally limited to individuals close enough to physically visit their store. Electronic communication allows for a quicker exchange of significantly more information about product between buyers and sellers.

Technology and Employment: The Fate of Working Communities. 
Introduction 
	Technology is one of the fundamental factor of today's stupefying development. Technology has massive influence towards everything that we see and interact in the present time. Ryan Barton, author of the article ""Technology's Explosion: The Exponential Growth Rate"" had affirmed that technology today had grown very rapid at a staggering rate where modern community will only require shorter time to develop new invention compared to those who live in the 80's and 70's. However, besides all this positive impact that blinded majority of the people living in the first world country, there are some negative consequences of automation. One of them is technology disrupt the structure of the job market which directly lead to high unemployment rate every year especially in manufacturing sectors and service based industries. 
Technology Disruption to The Manufacturing Sectors 
	With the increasing rate of world population, the demand for basic consumer products are also escalating every year. Few manufacturers find this to be challenging. By establishing new factories both in homeland and abroad had allowed manufacturers in developing country to meet the demand from retailers and public globally. There, technology had opened new windows for manufacturer to accomplish the task. At this moment, robotic arms and automated machines were abundantly spotted to work tirelessly in the assembly and processing lines alongside human labors. Due to their capability to produce products that are cheaper and in massive quantity as what claimed by Mc Afee and Brynjolfsson in their article titled ""Why Workers Are losing The War Against Machines"" (Para.4) many manufacturers today seems to have more interest on machines compared to human labor. Then, in another article titled ""What Happens to Society When Robots Replace Workers?"" by William H. Davidow and Michael S. Malone they both had claimed that large companies like Foxcomm had been spotted to have increase in the number of robot installation in most of their factories worldwide especially in China (Para. 4). Hence, technology and automation had made number of people in manufacturing sector to be dismissed from their career, making the market in industrial sectors to be more competitive. 
Technology Alter Jobs Structure in Many Service Based Industry. 
Beside the disruption to industrial manufacturing industry, experts also claimed that technology had altered occupation in the service based industries. Take for example company like Amazon who had change the way people shop today, shopping malls and outlets today seems to be needing less amount of employees in their corporations. In the same article, author Davidow and Malone had stated that new robots such as the Johnson and Johnson's Sedasys machines are deemed capable to replaced the jobs of a doctors in the near future. This will of course be a game changer to the job market in the medical world. Equally important, Mr. <name>, a <position> at Purdue University, alluded that technological company such as Uber and Lyft hold massive potential in replacing the role of cab drivers leading to transformation in the structure of transportation services. Therefore, masked by staggering development in modern world, technology had also deemed responsible for the alteration in many jobs structure on multifarious service based industries today. 
Technology for Better Future, lead to The Rise of Citizens with Zero Economic Values. 
	Most of us might have heard the overuse catch phrase, ""Technology for Better Future"". However, one should be aware that the catch phrase is just an inaccurate generalization as what I've mentioned earlier there are currently great number of people being unemployed due to the uprising of smart machines. Technology today had made an increase in community with ""zero economic values"" as mentioned by Davidow and Malone in the same article. Since, technology create a competitive job market, people who have less skill, knowledge and experience in the current technology would have hard time to land on jobs. Also asserted by Mc Mc Afee and Brynjolfsson, due to the uprising of technology, more employers are expecting to hire labors that are very skillful making those people who don't to be outperformed by others. In the interview, Mr. <name> agreed with the idea where he mentioned, ""technology had displaced certain group of people who don't have literacy with the new type of technology."" 
Opposition: Accelerating the Technology Make a World Where Nobody is Required to Work 
However, in the interview that I had, Mr. <name> had introduced to me a notion called ""Accelerationism"", a philosophy state that state by accelerating the technology to its maximum capability there will be an end to work, in other words, nobody will work. However, it is na ve idea to believe that there will be terminus for works soon especially with the current level of technological advancement that we had. Therefore, it is vital for the community to be concern about the negative impact of technology towards the current job markets and figure out ways to overcome them immediately. 
Philanthropically-sound Effort, Minimizing The Effect of Automation in Modern Job World 
	When it comes to unemployment epidemic in modern community, we might think that halting or controlling the development of technology would be the best way to curb this complication. However, based on the journal by Keith W. Miller, ""Technology, Unemployment, and Power"", the author proclaimed that the uprising of technology should not be considered immoral despite the irrefutable fact that they had seized enormous amount of jobs inside the community. Also mentioned by Miller in the same journal, some people view technology as an ""option"" while other look at them as vulnerability. Later in the article, Miller conclude that most of us agree that technology is something unavoidable. Thus, one of the way suggested by Mr. <name>, in order to curb this epidemic is by having an increase in philanthropical efforts by many company and organization today. As claimed by Mr. <name> larger company such as Google and Microsoft had already been spotted to have an increase in the amount of philanthropy, showing that they were concern with the disruption that their technology may cause towards the community. Therefore, increase in philanthropy by not only large technological company but also other firms and corporations worldwide was actually one of the way to curb the aftermath of mechanization in the community. Policy should also be establish by government to make sure that company will do charity works whenever they establish new technology in their working environment maybe in the form of tax or etcetera. 
Digital Literacy, Key to Survive the Modern Working Environment 
	Although philanthropy deemed to be capable in absorbing the impact of technology, but the effort only act as a temporary measure. A long term solution for this issue could be possibly done through education. In the same article by Davidow and Malone, they said ""., we need a new, individualized, cultural, approach to the meaning of work and the purpose of life."" In other words, education could be one of the approach to taught new generation about the basis of life. Skills and comprehensions in technology could be an asset that each individual should consider. Mr. <name> had mentioned that one of the reason leading to this situation is digital divide, a situation where people in different places received different levels of technology. Likewise, education held the potential to make a community or individual to be more digital literate thus eliminating the digital divide among the global community. Becoming competent in various skills related to the current technology could help one to be much more prepared to face the challenging job market that we have today especially when the job market shifts from ""Physical based economy"" to ""Knowledge based economy"" as mentioned by Mr. <name>. 
Conclusion 
	In conclusion, technology had change the world. Most of us had seen the power it possessed and how it could affect various aspects of life in the twenty-first century including the job market. Increasing amount of machination had been one of the uppermost reason that lead to the increasing amount of unemployment. First, technology had been claimed to cause disruption in modern manufacturing based industries. Then, technology had also altered jobs in numbers of service based industry. Last but not least, experts said that that ""Technology for Greater Future"" is only an inaccurate generalization spread among our modern community. Notions, after notions had been proposed by philosophers to support the benefit uprising of machines and robots in present time including ""Accelerationism"", however as claimed by Mr. <name>, it was still gullible idea that we could hardly achieve in a short range of time. Therefore, increasing philanthropically-sound efforts and refining education among the global community are some of the measures that could help reduce the gravity of the unemployment epidemic among the global community.

Argumentative assignment 
	Having to live in a competitive and hectic society, most people were overwhelmed with their works. Therefore, they can easily be stressed. The important point here is that most people have a misconception about stress. Generally, stress makes them to come up with some negative images because common people have believed stress is detrimental to them. There are some people who are willing to overcome their stress, but no ones who try to use their stress to improve their life. However, recent researches have shown stress could be beneficial for people. The fact above presented can help their lives to be more lively and efficiently. Therefore, it is important to clear up this misunderstanding that stress is harmful in order to better his or her life. I will discuss three possible reasons to support why stress is beneficial for people. 
	The first reason why stress is good for people is because stress has positive effects on our health. According to Dhabhar (2012), short-term stress can be good for our immune systems. To be specific, stress hormones are involved in immune cell distribution in the body. Various stress hormones released in our bodies, when someone gets stressed out. Immune cells show different reactions to each stress hormones and are affected by the type of leukocyte and its functional characteristic. Thus, stress hormone can improve immune system by managing changes in immune cell distribution. Stress hormones makes leukocytes to engage in the vaccination, wound healing and infection. They keep immune cells from being exposed to the detrimental matters. 
	Another reason is that stress plays an important role in our behaviors. Not only does stress stimulate creativity and encourage the ability in one's work, but it also makes us improve our memories and enhances creativities. According to Ven Katesh & Ram (2015, September), the moderate level of stress can cause employees to be more productive and effective than too much or too less of stress. 
	Last, stress can improve our life styles. Ashok Khurana & Roshan Lal (2010) assert that ""Stress is the spice of life and the absence of stress makes life dull, monotonous and spiritless."" Stress gives us challenge and opportunity to their life so that we can know our limits as well as improve our life styles. Also, Kelly Mc Gonigal (2013) asserts ""Stress makes you social."" and ""It find-tunes your brain's social instincts."" Social contact and support enhance the function of oxytocin. To be specific, this occurs when we need helps from others or others need helps from us. Another function of oxytocin is to resist to the stress based on my synthesis paper. Therefore, our life style can be changed into selfless service with recovering faster from stress. Thus, stress can change our life styles to be positive. 
In a sense, the fact excessive stress causes some illnesses from common cold to cardiovascular disease is true. However, Kelly Mc Gonigal (2015) suggests that ""it wasn't stress alone that was killing people. It was the combination of stress and the belief that stress is harmful."" Kelly Mc Gonigal (2015) cites specific statistics to support her claim. ""According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that would make ""believing stress is bad for you"" the fifteenth-leading cause of death in the United States, Killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS, and homicide."" Therefore, the belief that stress has negative effect on us harms people. 
In conclusion, I agree with that stress can be beneficial for us. Not only stress does enable our body to resistant to the detrimental matters, but it also helps us to be more alert so that we can get better results of works without stress. We can reduce stress by being sociable with helping other people or being helped from others, and stress gives us opportunity to challenge to their life. For these reasons, it is important to clear up the misconception about stress and to believe stress is beneficial for us because the belief stress has negative effects on us would bothers us.

Food Social Safety Nets: a good way of solving food security problems 
In developing countries 
Because of some historical, environmental, political and populations problems, the food insecurity became a huge problem in a lot of countries, especially in developing countries (M, Duncan, Cynthia). Governments cannot let this problem become more and more serious and they built food social safety nets. A completed food social safety net can solve food security problems in developing countries. Because it can bring poor people money for food and healthy food. In order to build and improve a food social safety nets, developing countries' governments need to pay a lot of money and attentions. They have to request money and food aid from international organizations even UN because of the national money lacking. 
People in developing countries get benefits from food social safety nets. One of the biggest reason why people in developing countries can't get food is because they don't have enough money The price of food can be controlled by food social safety nets and the ridiculous food price rising can be avoided (FAO). If people still don't have enough money to buy food, they can also get some aid money from the social safety nets. With these money, they can buy food they need.10.2% of households In Jordan and 25.3% of households in Syria received cash assistance through the food social safety nets (Doocya). This function was called Price subsidies (Haggblade, Diallo, Staatz 5). 
Another biggest problem is the quality and quantity of food. The food social safety nets can offer people much healthier food. These are a lot of examples which shows that food social safety nets are a correct the useful way to solving food insecurity problems. In the article Food Safety Nets: International Experience and Implications for Mali , this function of food social safety nets called directly feeding. Government provide school lunches for poor students, Soup kitchens and homeless shelters, provide free prepared food to selected poor people. 
In Mongolia, government use 9 million US dollars to design and start the food stamp program, and another 3 million US dollars were used to improve the program. With these money, at least 100 thousand poor families can get healthier and nutritious food. The world bank approved a 13 million US dollars' program in order to help the food and agriculture safety net in Cambodia(Mohamad). If the food social safety nets are not useful, The World Bank will not approved so much money on the social safety nets program. Except getting food from international organizations, food social safety nets can also use the national food resources. In Swaziland, because of the unbalanced food distribution, a lot of people have food insecurity problems. Then, community food kitchens appear. Neighborhoods share food and urban households can get food from rural households (Tevera 248). 
But there are still a lot of people thought that food social safety nets are useless. Because of the serious corruption situation in developing counties, money for food social safety nets cannot totally used for solving food security problems for people (Dr ze). In China, each year, government used billions of dollars for the the food social safety nets. But money is not directly sent to people. Firstly, government sent money to the provinces' account, then small cities' account, different districts in cities, street councils, finally those people. When money was sent to those people who needed, only little left. And after so many years running food social safety nets, the food security problems in developing countries did not change apparently. People also think that without making good plans and rules for food social safety nets by considering the current situation, even those developing countries can get a lot of supports from international organizations, the food security condition still cannot change. 
As we all know, every coin has two sides. If we want to know whether the food social safety nets are useful, we need to compare the two sides of it. The corruption problems are big problems in developing countries and it really make food social safety nets lost a lot of money. However, there are still a lot of money can be used to solve food insecurity problems. In Jordan and Syria, because of the war and other emergencies, the corruption was really common in these countries, however, there are still 18% of households in Jordan and 93% of households in Syria can get aid food (Doocya). Food insecurity problems are not some problems which can be easily solved, it always combined with human civilizations, especially poor developing countries. A very small progress in food security is a huge success for the food social safety nets. Different countries have different situation for food insecurity problems, making plans and rules are definitely not an easy work to do. Governments need to considering history food insecurity problems and and current condition. Only with a lot of experiments, even failures, the good plan for the food social safety nets can be found. 
Food social safety nets can make benefits to more than just people, it can also make multiple benefits to developing countries. With the social safety nets, the aids and food donates can be well organized and effectively distribute. Without the safety nets, there are still a lot of aid food. However, because of the lack of organizing, food can not be well used, most of they will be wasted. Also, building connections between social safety nets (developing countries) and international organizations (like UN) can let organizations know the food insecurity situations in those developing countries better, then organizations can help with more specific targets in order to solve the different food problems in different developing countries. Solving food problems are not only the responsibility for governments but also what citizens should pay attention. Food social safety nets are the backup insurance for people, which can also encourage people trying their best to solve food problems. 
Food social safety nets in developing countries are really a good way to solve food insecurity problems. However, the sure thing is that there are still a lot of other useful ways to solve the difficult and serious food problems. Such as improving productivity and reducing the waste during transport. As one of the human, we need to try our best to help solving food insecurity problems. In that case, less people will die because of hunger and this fits the idea of humanitarianism, which means our world will be more and more peaceful. we hope one day in the future, food problem can be well solved.

"Should Fast Food Chains Focus on Consumers' Needs? 
It is undeniable that Americans generally rely on fast food. Fast food industry is enormous and chains within are highly organized, because quite a few fast-food chains run 24 hours restaurants, provide similar types of food and even use nearly identical ingredient. These restaurants all make efforts to attract more customers, and they should try to focus on consumers' needs in terms of nutritious value and freshness of food ingredient. 
Fast food chains should emphasize the concept of nutrition-balanced diet in their menus because extra nutritious ingredients can bring more profit to chains. Mc Donalds can offer tasty foods including French fries, but some potential consumers, who like delicious food but don't typically need it, are concerned about their health more than taste of food. In order to catch these consumers' eye, the chain may want to introduce some ingredients that contribute to health into its menus. Mc Donalds has already made ""commitments to offer improved nutritious choices"" and adds low-calories food such as salad and fruit milkshake in its official website. Besides Mc Donalds, Another national top fast food chains including Subway also make a difference to improve nutritious quality of food. For instance, Subway finds ways to add calcium, vitamin and fibers to food, making diet more nutrient Juliann Schaeffer, 18 . Seen from these cases, these two large fast-food chains create more food options. It means that it is equally or more profitable for them to give consumers more choices or they would not bother to do it. 
In addition, consumers need food contributing to long-term health. Professor Steven Hillis said that consumers trust fast food because it is easy for them to predict what foods are available. However, what consumers do now is more than predicting. They probably expect food free from trans-fat because campaign to ban trans-fat has been going on for years and achieves great success. Stephen Joseph says, ""Trans-fat content in the national food supply has diminished dramatically. There is so much news about trans-fat that it is impossible to track it."" It is natural for consumers to expect food free from trans-fat due to regulation of fast food content. Although some chains such as Mc Donalds had a hard time finding substitute oil without trans-fat, they had to change much content of their food to live up to customers' expectation. In the same way, other fast-food chains are supposed to provide consumers with trans-fat-free food. Otherwise, it is possible that upscale consumers will eat less fast food because of concern of long-term health. 
Children make up a major group of fast food consumers and parents who often purchase fast food for kids may take nutrition value as an important factor in choosing restaurants, so the chains should try to offer more healthy options for children. Professor Hillis demonstrated that as more parents spent most of their time outside families, they tend to choose fast food because parents that need to work and children that often have fun with friends try to spend as little time as possible on food. Parents who got out of work would like to grab some food quickly on their way to pick up their kids at some preschools or friends' home, because it was more convenient for the parents with more spared money to buy fast food and for children to choose fast food when they were away from parents. Such families rely on fast food. Given time they will think about whether children's diet is balanced or not. A fast nutritious meal may cost more, but it offers nutrition as well as convenience, so the chains are very likely to make parents who care little about making their own meals regular customers. 
Nowadays, consumers not only need nutritious food but also crave fresh ingredients. Chains should also value freshness because consumers prefer freshly made food to processed food. Fast-food chains like Subway and Wendy's make their own specials, but they also have some fresh ingredient in common. It can be seen from a fact that Jargon Julie stated. Subway was more popular among consumers than Arby's because about ten percent more consumers believed that Subway sliced its meat in its own restaurant than that in Arby's (B.11). It shows a trend where consumers want fresh-made food more than processed food, and chains that adapt to this trend successfully make more profits. 
Consumers demand healthy and fresh ingredient more than before. Thus, fast food chains should pay close attention to those changes to meet consumers' need so that they can maintain and improve profits that it can make. Most importantly, the chains adapt to changes so that both chains and consumers get benefit.

Argumentative essay 
Future dominant power in China- ""Makers"" 
	These years as our society develops by leaps and bounds, there appeared a bunch of people who stayed together in a workshop, consuming their spare time creating meaningful stuffs by applying sophisticated technology. In China, we call this kind of people ""makers"". Makers' appearance in China perfectly corresponds to people's demand for endless creativity and efficiency. Their products not only make our daily life better, but also, to some extent, give us desire to move on. Their intension grows beyond just obtaining fulfilment. Instead, they start to appeal to more people to join them, giving out positive energy, which brings the market as well as the education system into a benign cycle. In a nutshell, the trend of creating stuffs and building companies in Chinese society now and the willingness of Chinese people to gain further advance technology and science would contribute a lot to makers' steady development in China as well as their dominant power in Chinese society, which might be another milestone of change in Chinese history. 
	One of the biggest reasons why makers are able to grow further in China is that their fast development mostly relies on industrial configuration of companies, which transfers from manufacturing to innovating now. At before, Chinese people were experiencing low creativity and were short of products, so that most people got together building up huge amounts of factories and worked hard to produce as much as possible. At that moment, Chinese people didn't have the ability and time to learn advanced knowledge or create new things because of the dilemma they were in. Nevertheless, nowadays we have already been the biggest manufacturer in the world, owning many well-known companies that devote themselves into producing and assembling. We have enough resource to sustain our production chain and therefore enhance our capability to evolute. Makers' appearance gives China chance to transfer from a manufacturing country to a creative country, which is vital for our future. There are some counterpoints why makers cannot go further in China. One of those points is that some people announce that we should go back to innocent, back to the simple days. They say that our developments have already done great damage to the environment. What's worse, natural resources, like rare metal and mineral substance, have been largely expended. So they believe that we have to stop from further exploiting, or we will die out from over exploiting. Nonetheless, this cannot even be a suggestion for us to stop developing because development is what saves our world. Without it, we might live in an easier life for a short period, but we have yet to face that day when we run out of our resource. What makers do are to come up with better ideas to increase our efficiency in producing and improve our daily lives. Undoubtedly, the advantages of makers outweigh their disadvantages; and in the near future, makers will become a dominant power in Chinese society. 
	Another aspect that supports makers' evolution is their great nature, including creativity and perseverance. When we talk about makers, we must talk about their inseparable features. Most of them have the characteristics of creating and hardworking because only after they gain the determination to make a thing successfully can they perform their best knowledge in science and technology and be highly creative. As more and more young people are drawn by this ""job"", these helpful natures deeply take root in people's mind. Lots of high schools in China add courses to teach students how to make stuffs and ""makers culture"". Students will learn how to make plans before starting to do their works and they will be guided to learn how to be creative and resourceful. These skills will help them become good makers in the future. We know that young kids are the future of the country. When they grow up, there will be more excellent young blood injecting into the power of makers, which will not only elevate our education level higher, but also help makers to further develop. More importantly, ""maker movement"" could become a milestone in Chinese history. In the long river of history, each industry revolutions has specific figures that lead the whole precess. With their overwhelming advantages and power, they could get rid of the old ideas and exchange to more correct ones. The fact that they have a great impact on Chinese society, attracting more and more young people to join this trend; and the Chinese government also launch several policies to help them thriving. Consequently, makers' own personalities contribute to their thrive in China by propagating positive energy. In the future, they can be a predominant power and a milestone in Chinese history for their great contributions. 
	Many people argue that no matter how impressive the ""maker movement"" is or how great the influence it has, makers are still not strong enough to stay in today's society, just like a firework which won't last for long. This argument might be true for some of the rising companies or competent workers in China, because every year there are mountains of new stuffs that happen in China, so not all of them will be held throughout time. However, when it comes to makers, this statement is no longer valid because different from firework, makers are more like a burgeoning power which is just what we need to make our world better. As there are many supportive factors, like the transforming trend of Chinese companies and the desire of improving the education level, ""makers movement"" will grow larger and larger until one day when most of us achieve happiness. Then there will be something new appeared.

"Benefits of Living On Campus for Students 
Did you know that living in the dormitories for four years could increase your cumulative and semester grade point average by a letter grade while giving you the chance to meet a wide variety of people who are outside of your usual social scene? Multiple studies provide evidence that the residence of students could change the way they get involved with their schools and the communities. That is why many large universities require freshman to live in the residence halls, and provide various academic services such as tutoring for the residences. Life in the university residence halls is more beneficial for students in terms of their academic and social life. 
Zach Birch, the Area Coordinator of Tarkington Hall, who was one of my interviewees, mentioned that the staff who are working in the residence halls and their policies lead to a community where people feel safe to study, and continued by saying, ""In the residence halls we have a lot to offer in terms of communal learning."" Working collaboratively as a community does not only help students to get their work done, but it also helps them to develop skills that will prepare them for the professional world, where teamwork is essential for success. From the early experience I had, I have always found living in the dormitories more beneficial when it comes to academics. Especially for first year students who are required to take the general education classes, by living in the dormitories, they can find many people who are taking the same classes and are assigned to do the same work. This similarity will naturally open up a collaborative working environment where students can share their knowledge, and work together without any university sponsored assistance. Additionally, according to the research that included approximately six thousand undergraduate students that are sophomores or above at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis in Fall 2008, the authors, Pedro de Araujo and James Murray (2010), stated that on average, living on campus increases a single semester and cumulative grade point average by 0. 19 to 0. 97 points. 
In addition to leading to better classroom performance, living in university residence halls has various social benefits and opportunities for students. According to Kasha Patel (2012), the author of the article ""10 Reasons to Live in a Dorm for 4 Years"", life in the dormitories is an once-in-a-lifetime experience, and there are ten solid reasons for students to live in a dormitory for 4 years. One of the top reasons for living in a dormitory as described by the article is location and proximity to university services. Classes, cafeterias, friends, libraries, and sports centers are all within walking distance. Another key factor as stated by Patel is safety. Dormitories have security cameras, restricted access to the buildings, and residence hall assistants on duty. Nobody can enter the building without a student ID card, and this keeps the dormitory as a secure living area for students. Veer Patil, a residence hall assistant who has experienced life both on and off campus, brought up another point by mentioning the open-door policies and how they help students feel like a part of a large community by saying ""We have forty-six kids on our floor, so you have made forty-five friends coming into college. Most of the residence halls have open-door policies that encourage a lot of new friendships."" Additionally, Zach Birch, who has defined the social experience as a big learning opportunity, added that life in the residence halls encourages students to get along with their peers who are living around them, and work with individuals who have different perspectives, which are necessary skills in life. 
Life on and off campus affects individuals in various ways due to the different expectations they have. After going through the process of conducting interviews and researching sources that could prove my point, I am confident in suggesting that living in the university residence halls has more benefits when compared to living off campus in terms of academic and social success for the majority of students. In addition to improving the academic performance and having a significant increase in the student's grade point average, life in the residence halls also provide numerous social advantages such as the opportunity to meet people with different values and view points. In conclusion, when it is time to decide where to live for the next school year, students shouldn't let peoples' thoughts and the biased judgment of society guide their decision. They should consider all the effects that living on and off campus might have, so that they will not be one of the many students who move back to their dormitories after experiencing that one horrible year off campus in the future.

"China Internet Censorship
With the rapid development of the Chinese Internet, plenty of people are participating in social network groups. It is no doubt that the Internet has an impact on people's life. In addition, the Internet has became a booming phenomenon. However, with such exponential growth of the Internet users, the censorship of Chinese Internet is enhancing. It is also becoming a hot issue in our contemporary society. According to Google Dictionary, censorship means ""The practice of officially examining books, movies, etc, and suppressing unacceptable parts."" More and more people concentrate on the issue of that whether the government should censor the Internet or not. In fact, among the young people, there are two sides that hold distinct views, I support that the government should not censor the Internet.
On the one hand, many people claim that the government should not censor the Internet. In fact, the demerits of Chinese Internet censorship overweigh its merits. Some supporting reasons are displayed as well, which include entertainment factor, and outside resources, and some suggestions from U.S. Policy. Personally speaking the entertainment factor is the largest problem that people concentrate on. People are prohibited to go through some foreign websites, such as Facebook and Youtube. The reason why people can not go through those websites is that they shed some negative lights on Chinese society. For example, the videos and criticism about the Tiananmen demonstration where a great number of students, workers and citizens demonstrated on the Tiananmen Square and fought for their freedom(Picture). It has already been censored by the government. Unfortunately, demonstration was suppressed by forcing of the government, to tell the truth, it reflects the inverses of society in that period of time. Most foreigners knew this phenomenon and pointed out to the world. Nonetheless, the Chinese government laid itself out to conceal the truth of facts. One of the main measures is to filter the information about any sources of this history. Another happening is called the ""Fa Lun Gong event,"" some people who believe in an illegal religion Fa Lun Gong, went to the street and committed suicide.
Those people who believe in Fa Lun Gong trust their god, they may believe only when they died so that they could live in a happy life, go to heaven suicide and do not need to suffer in society. The government thinks the religion is irregular and should be forbidden, so the government took the same measures to censor this information as it did to Tiananman demonstration. Those kinds of information and sources have been censored by Chinese government, because the historical events can not advance the society, conversely, it could not promote the development of the contemporary situation. If most Chinese people knew that, the society of China would perhaps be chaotic. However, with restriction view some entertainment websites, in such situation, people may lose chances to meet new friends from other countries. In addition, they could not get amusement from Youtube. Some Chinese people ""turn over the wall"" which means they use anti-web-blocking software to break down the control area of the government so that they can go through some prohibited websites. In my opinion, it is reasonable, people have right to gain what they want, it reveals that they want to get sources from outside attitude. The more concealment of the government, the more people want to know the truth.
Then, Chinese people can not get a few resources about the historical information and feedback from the outside world. The government censors the BBC, and Voice of America in order to suppress outside views (Censorship of the Content). It is a fact that Chinese people just live in their own world, they have few opportunities to connect with the outside world. For example, much of the information and videos about Fa Lun Gong which is an illegal religion in China and the Tiananmen demonstrations are shown on foreign websites. The dissidents think that they should be taught about historical issues. When people search for sensitive topics on the Internet, often the search is blank because of the censorship. It is one of the reasons that Google withdrew from the China mainland, Google wants a freedom of searching space, it can not be achieved in China. From my perspective, after many years, people have right to know the historical problems, they have necessity to know, and they need to learn lessons from history.
As figure 1 shows to us all, it is clear that there is proportion of top sites blocked. For instance, the hot issues of Tibet, Taiwan and equality, even the topic about revolution in China, those are filtered by the legislations. The position to treat domestic problem of China is different from other countries. It is no doubt that Chinese government is begging the questions of sensitive issues. Here are some detailed examples: the topic contradicts the principles defined in the constitution [of PRC], endangers national security, discloses States secrets, subverts the government, destroys the unity of the country, especially the damages the honor and the interests of the States (Censorship of the Content). We may understand the points are precisely right, however, the action is definitely wrong.
The government stated that the purpose of those kinds of actions is for protecting Chinese people and avoiding getting confused information. However, a great number of people want to get the truth of the facts, they may hold it is one of the ways to protect themselves. Because of Chinese Internet censorship, many sources are not permitted to citizens. As long as they know the historical information, and the Chinese government acknowledge it, we may think about how to fix it in appropriate methods so that it can accelerate the development of the whole society.
Another survey is about mainland China's view on the Internet censorship (survey), 1702 Internet users are answered 42 questions. It reveals that 79.2% of Chinese citizens definitely disagree with Chinese government's censors and filters the Internet. 69.8% percent use the anti-web-blocking software to see some foreign websites which are prohibited by the Chinese government. It's no doubt that the survey stands on the con-censorship side, to some extent, it proves thoughts of most Chinese people and provides the credibility to the society. Therefore, it may persuade Chinese people to believe it. From such kind of information, most Chinese people believe that the Internet should not be censored by legislatures.
The U. S has suggested ways to deal with Chinese censorship (Issues for U.S. Policy):
* Enacting legal prohibitions on U.S. companies that would aid PRC Government censorship efforts;
* Creating U.S. governmental institutions for promoting global Internet freedom;
* Funding the development of counter-censorship technologies;
In fact, those suggestions are beneficial from the position of U.S. People could not claim that they agree with all of them, however, they do believe most of them. From my point of view, I do believe the second propose, if the suggestion can be achieved on some day, the action of U.S legislation is not only attaining the benefits of other countries, but also safeguard the freedom of the whole Internet system. To some extent, those suggestions proves that other countries hope Chinese government do not censor the Internet and block some websites which are probably essential to Chinese society and people.
On the other hand, a few people think the government should censor the Internet. They may have their reasons. Population and policy issues are mentioned here. In the first place, as is known to us all, China has a large population, people have right to public issues freely, however, some people may put some drawbacks of Chinese society, it would be chaotic. We could not go against this point totally, nevertheless, those drawbacks, in fact, prove that our government and society do need to improve so that it will build a positive feedback to citizens. The dissidents argue that policy is another important issue, regulation of Chinese Internet is a part of policy, it reveals the responsibility of the government. We could not think it is not reasonable, however, for the government to show respect to netizens.
Generally speaking, if the government do not censor the Internet, some solutions could be used to treat this phenomenon. In the first place, people should approach the historical problem in a rational way. Everyone could make mistakes, although it may sacrifice many people's lives, because people fought for their freedom and were forced by the government, as time goes by, something can be forgiven, something can not, it belongs the former one. We do hope those people's lives who are worthy of being sacrificed. If the government exposes the truth of the facts and let more people know them, it should be forgiven. However, Chinese people ought to treat historical issues in the correct way. Secondly, all Internet users have a duty to establish a harmonious environment of the Internet. Creating a wholesome Internet space does not only mean to accept beneficial information, it also includes the behavior of people who browse the sources, netizens should restrain themselves when they hear the negative news about China from other countries.
In conclusion, it is hard to judge whether the government should censor and filter the information on the internet or not. From my perspective, I do support that the government should not censor and filter the Internet, the action of censorship by the government may disturb the right to learn the truth of Chinese people. Although both sides have their supporting reasons, on the background of the whole society and world, other countries also believe it's not beneficial to develop the economy of China. What people can do is using the Internet reasonably, logically and show responsibility to the government policy.

"Nuclear Energy as the Solution to Energy Challenge 
Argumentative Essay 
April 16, 2015 
Purdue University 
Author's note 
Abstract 
Renewable energy, from my preliminary research has shown a drastically appealing future. After the identification of the potential of renewable energy in providing humans the solution to the energy challenge ahead, I conducted an interview with an energy expert, <Name> about his thoughts on the potential of renewable energy. However, I realized through a lengthy process of research that the limitations of renewable energy made it exceptionally hard to overcome. Hence, I have decided that while renewable energy technology is taking a long while to catch up to solving the energy challenges, my argument is that nuclear energy is the way to go. I have numerous researchers (Kharecha, 2013; Freed, 2014; Chu, 2012; Brook, 2014; Corner, 2011) supporting my argument. While both systems are flawed, I remain adamant that nuclear energy is the most realistic approach to tackling energy challenge. 
Keywords: Nuclear energy, energy solution, energy challenge 
Nuclear Energy as the Solution to Energy Challenge 
Introduction 
To harness nuclear energy, there are several reactors, which includes the nuclear fusion reactor. As this is a highly advanced technology, only certain countries across the globe harness energy through nuclear energy. Often times, the regulation towards nuclear energy reactor is so strict, that t takes a decade or maybe more to build one single reactor that passes the standards of the Nuclear Energy Association. There are several reasons, despite the complexity of nuclear energy that makes it an attractive source of energy. In comparison to all other forms of major energy provider, coal and petroleum, nuclear energy is able to generate similar amount of energy with significantly less effects towards the environment. As the population has increased by four times the original times of Christopher Columbus, the energy consumption, is increased by 10 times (Lee, 2011). With energy demand increasing at such rapidity, nuclear energy is the best source of energy to fulfill the demand. 
Nuclear Energy as the Solution 
Firstly, nuclear energy is a form of energy that stems from the fission of subatomic particles. The most common form of radioactive substances used is uranium. Upon the mention of nuclear energy, one cannot avoid many instances where deaths are caused by the meltdown of nuclear power plant, which causes radiation of extensive degree that in turn causes death and cancer. The classic example includes the Chernobyl and Fukushima incident. While nuclear power meltdown are often largely reported with adverse effects, scientific papers have concluded that the death caused by nuclear power, are far lower than the avoided deaths. According to Kharecha, (2013) ""Globally, we calculate 4900 such deaths, or about 370 times lower than our result for avoided death ... About 25% of these deaths are due to occupational accidents, and about 70% are due to air pollution-related effects"" (p. 1). Scientists were also unable to conclusively attribute deaths to radiation, even from the major accident, mainly Three Mile Island, March 1979, and Fukushima Daiichi, March 2011 incident (Kharecha, 2013). It has been clearly embedded in the mind of the population through the media that nuclear energy generation is to be absolutely avoided for the mass impact towards human population. However, mankind cannot ignore the probability that humans have avoided more death with nuclear energy generation. 
	The main reason why fossil fuels are so depended upon is due to the fact that generation of energy using petroleum is constant, as long as the supply of petroleum is constant. This feature is prominently illustrated as one of the outstanding trait nuclear generation has. While the same is arguable with using coal as the means of generating energy, it is already proven statistically that coal and gas generation are far more harmful than nuclear power. Fuel switching from fossil fuels to coal will cause even more severe climate condition for several reasons. The carbon capture technology is too immature to be depended upon as a dependent constrain to the emissions. The current usable natural gas, like shale gas consists of hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes of carbons, which causes major climate global warming (Pushker, 2013). This brings us to my previous conclusion of renewable energy being the solution. As optimistic as I can get, the gap between the ability of renewables to generate energy as compared to fossil fuels is nowhere near the actual growing demand. While there is a huge part of the human population going against nuclear energy generation, nuclear energy has the ability of generating energy without causing any form of climate change, besides being able to generate as much energy as coal. After almost 30 years of decline in students graduating as nuclear engineers, there are a sudden spike in this field, all because people starts recognizing the importance of nuclear generation of energy that is completely emission free, with huge potential (Freed, 2014). 
	One of the main concerns among the public would be managing the excess waste after the generation of energy from all the radioactive particles. To demand for absolute zero waste is impossible regardless of what form of energy there is available even right now. Hence, the best way is to make these waste recyclable, which in fact, is a technology currently holds a great promise. Ages ago, between the period of 1964 until 1994, the Argonne and Idaho National Laboratories, was able to create IFR, the integral fast reactor, that uses 99% of nuclear fuel, leaves so little waste that decays way below the background level of radiation, within 300 years, shutting itself down automatically, cools itself indefinitely even if the system fails or the facility is abandoned (Brook, 2014). With further research, I have fate that the technology can further be enhanced to manage the waste even better than it already is. Nuclear power plants are getting more advanced, with high regulatory standards before a nuclear plant is allowed to operate. The nuclear plant is constantly regulated and updated. The Department of Energy of United States are also supporting the research on the designs of nuclear power plants (Chu, 2012). 
	The widely analyzed topic regarding nuclear energy has a great emphasis on the public acceptance of exploring nuclear energy generation as the solution to our energy challenge. Public opinion matters, and may make or break the development of nuclear energy. Taking United Kingdom as an example, the public with major concerns over climate change and energy security managed to shift the energy policy in favor of nuclear energy as it is classified under low-carbon technology. However, many reports have shown how majority of people are reluctant to accept nuclear energy as the method to addressing the greater energy needs. Based on a national British survey, the public remains divided in opinion on embracing nuclear energy (Corner, 2011). 
Conclusion 
Energy generation using nuclear energy is just the alternative while searching for a better solution to the energy challenge. The reason that nuclear energy is the most feasible at the moment, is due to the fact that the gap between the amount of energy generated by coal and petroleum as compared to renewable energy is too far a gap, and to tighten the gap, will take up to several decades. The correlation between developed country and energy consumption proves that the more advance the country is, the higher the usage of energy. All across the globe, countries are developing, and with high development rate, the energy consumption is on the rise (Lee, 2011). While nuclear energy is able to supply the demand of energy, it is also able to do so without emitting carbon to the atmosphere, with resources that are able to supply energy for the next centuries to come. I am confident that nuclear energy should be developed to suit energy generation for human usage, instead of being left out as part of the energy solution, seeing that it has a huge potential towards the solution.

The Argumentation On ""Whether Marco Polo have been to China"" 
About seven hundred years ago, Marco Polo became the first European who traveled to Ancient China for trade. When him came back to Europe, he published a book to introduce his experience in ancient China to European people. The book is known as ""Marco Polo's journey in China"", which caused a dramatic impact to the society of Europe. In the book, Marco Polo successfully depicted a broad image on the amazing civilization of China. However, most of the details he provides in the book are somehow exaggerating. For example, he said that imperial palaces in China are entirely made of gold and silver. He also implied in his book that both Chinese male and female wore Silk clothes on the street every day. Therefore, his book remained as a controversial work through the history. The opponents state that Marco Polo fabricated his work and he became famous by cheating the people. They start to question the work of Marco Polo for several aspects. They can be summarized as four questions. why did Marco Polo fail to record the great Wall of China? Why didn't Marco mention anything about Chinese writing system? Why didn't Marco provide any description on the bound foot of Chinese women? Why didn't Marco Polo speak any Chinese if he claimed to stay in China for seventeen years. I am here to defend my position as an opponent. 
The Arguments of the advocate of Marco Polo 
The great wall we see today is much more different from it was in ancient China. About seven hundred years ago, the great wall was small and unattractive due to the lack of maintainability. In addition to that, there was not much great wall in China at that age. This is the reason that Marco didn't pay much attention to the wall. 
According to the record, Marco lived with Mongols while he was in China. As a minority group, Mongols don't have to learn how to write or speak Chinese. Moreover, Marco was mere a semi-literate merchant and he had no interest to introduce the Chinese writing system in his book. 
The custom of bound foot didn't spread over the Entire China at that time yet. In another word, not many Chinese women practice this custom. Even it was practiced by some of Chinese women, the cripple women would stay at home and shouldn't be observed by Marco Polo. 
The official language for Chinese upper class was Turkish or Persian at the that time. Since Marco Polo was recruited by Chinese emperor to work in the royal court, he is supposed to use Turkish language or Persian language. 
Mine arguments 
The great wall already existed for centuries before Marco Polo came to China. According to the recent research, there were huge amount of ancient Chinese great wall 
Relics Found in central Asia or northern China. Here is the quote. ""Despite the lack of literary reference, my feeling is that the survival of relics & constructions in the Central Asian deserts suggests that there might have been quite a lot of Great Wall extant in those areas at the time."" (Did Marco Polo go to China p-296 Frances W). In addition to that. Even though that these ancient great wall were old and inconspicuous, they still remained in a striking amount on the silk road. When Marco Polo was passing by the road, it is unreasonable for he to just ignore these strange military buildings. In the book he wrote to introduce China, he doesn't mention one word about these great wall. 
It is true that Marco Polo lived with Mongol people for all time in China. Nonetheless, this fact doesn't mean that Marco had no chance to observe Chinese writing by himself. In the contrast, Marco should be able to notice Chinese writing system for many times. For instance, Marco Polo introduced the Chinese paper money in his book. He provides all the descriptions for the paper money except the Chinese words onside. Even though that he was not well-educated people, he should notice the unique writing order of the Chinese words. 
As a matter fact, there was another foreigner who traveled to China at same period. His name was Odoric of Pordenone and he came to between 1320 and 1330. Marco came to China at the end of 13th century. Therefore, they were at the same period. Odoric also provides the introduction to China in his book. Among all other description in his book, the description on the bound foot of Chinese women was one of the most shocking realities. In the contrast, Marco didn't write down a single sentence to introduce this custom in his book for all time. 
Even though that the official language was not Chinese in that time, all the major cities should have their own original Chinese names. For example, Yang Zhou was one of the Chinese cities that once were visited by Marco Polo. As a foreigner who was not capable of using Chinese language, Marco didn't mention any problems on Chinese interpretations in his book. Instead of that, Marco labeled the name of Hang Zhou in Turkish or Persian language. It seems to me that Marco Polo was not bothered by the Chinese interpretation at all. I found it conspicuous that a foreign merchant who claimed to live in China for seventeen years and was not bothered by Chinese interpretation at all. Here is the statement from a researcher, ""Unlike William of Ru Bruck, who complained about his, Marco Polo never raises the question of interpreters or interpretation (except in one passage in the mid-15th century Toledo manuscript which I will discuss further)"" (Did Marco Polo go to China P-296 Frances W) 
Conclusion 
For each argument provided by advocates of Marco Polo, I refute it in an objective attitude. As a result, the opponents have advantages over the defenders of Marco Polo. The conclusion is clear that Marco Polo didn't come to China in the history.

Argumentative Paper 
Bright Sides of Legalizing Prostitution in South Korea 
Prostitution has been one of the longest human cultures existing in the history, and, at the same time, has been unraveling controversy whether it is right or wrong to have in its own society. In here, we will treat specifically South Korea's prostitution law which is illegal yet ineffective. Despite there are many opposing arguments, Korea needs to change the law to be legal because prostitution is inevitable, law enforcement is ineffective, and there are quite many advantages by legalizing prostitution in Korea. 
Korea is one of the 2 OECD countries that hold illegal prostitution law and there are people who believe that Korea is doing right thing because they think, regardless of how women enter the sex trade, their procurers manipulate and abuse them economically Kim, 2007. It is true that the abuses had happened and could still be remaining some; however, that is a story of at least 20- 30 year ago when Korea was relatively poor country and having a big economical development. As of 2015, Korea is world's 11th largest economy, a member of OECD, and ranks a high value of in terms of ""human development."" Despite its comparably high level of ""development,"" Korea continues to be a major source of trafficked and smuggled in commercial sex trade Yoo, 2009. Then, it can be presumably concluded that the majority women in sex trade are not in desperate situation that they were forced into the prostitution yet volunteered to be in the position. 
Is it nonetheless an effective law not making any better from being a major source of commercial sex trade in the country? It is now time for Korea to take a thoughtful change by legalizing prostitution because it is proven that prostitution is somewhat unavoidable in Korea, illegal prostitution makes huge occupational unfairness, and legalizing prostitution will get Korea benefits in tax and citizen health. 
To be more specific about unproductiveness of illegalized prostitution law, it is helpful realizing deeper investigation on Korea's economic status on sex market. According to the Korean Women's Development Institute 2004, the sex trade generates approximately 1. 6 per cent of GDP, or about $14 billion annually by comparison, South Korea's agriculture industry accounts for roughly three per cent of GDP. An illegalized underground market makes practically around half of a country's agriculture industry? This probe is shamefully revealing prostitution law is not working properly at all and sex market is openly on the surface of the society. Moreover, the amount of 1.6% of country's GDP going just either to sex workers or pimps is a great loss to the country. Not to mention about tax benefit from legalizing prostitution, there are several more critical advantages from it. 
According to 100 countries and Their Prostitution Policies 2015, more than 60% countries are either legalizing or limited legalizing on prostitution. And 30 OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries out of 32 are taking either legalizing or limited legalizing stance on prostitution. The advantages can be found on the prostitution-legal-experienced countries. Brothels are legal in a number of places over the world including Nevada, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand Weitzer, 2007. Even though statutory regulations vary by countries, those countries' common objective is one, harm reduction. Research suggests that under the suitable conditions, legal prostitution can be organized in a way that raise workers' health, safety, and job satisfaction. Mandatory condom use and other safe-sex practices are ordinary in legal brothels, and the workers would face much lower risk of abuse from customers para. 2. 
Lastly and most importantly, illegalized prostitution law could bring down motivation of most ethical citizens who work in their position respecting laws that eventually end up dragging more women to a sex trade industry and inspire angers from hard workers. Under Korea, where under ground sex industry is not well regulated, there is no fear to enter and exit the market, no set market price, and not even a tax imposed on their sex trade. Because of this sweet 'easy money' system, it is even harder for the sex workers, who once have experienced it, to step out. Furthermore, the people who legally work harder, contributing their own money to country, yet getting relatively tiny amount of income would sooner or later get tired of the wrongful situation. 
There is yet no perfect solution on dealing with prostitution, but numerous countries have applied countless different ways in different circumstances over the centuries that they made it easier to pick better option amongst its own cases. Knowing the size of underground market, disadvantages of health, economy, safety, and social norm, there is nowhere to step back anymore and it is indeed time for Korea to pick more valuable option that would satisfy both country and its citizens.

"Keeping America's Minimum Legal Drinking Age
In 1984, the federal government enacted the Uniform Drinking Age Act, after the number of motor vehicle accidents involving teenagers increased when the drinking age was lowered. This act required all states to set a minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 21 or risk losing a significant portion of their state's federal highway funds. This was done based on evidence that a lower drinking age resulted in more traffic injuries and fatalities among youth, citizen advocacy groups pressured states to restore the minimum legal drinking age to 21. In this paper I will discuss the reasons that the minimum legal drinking age should be kept at 21 are that the driving crashes increased when the MLDA was first lowered in the 1970's, the introduction of younger teens to alcohol will rise, and the refutations of lowering MLDA arguments. These reasons are why the America's minimum legal drinking age should remain as it is.
When the MLDA was first lowered between 1970-1975, scientists began studying the effects of the lowered MLDA. Several studies in the 1970s found that motor vehicle crashes increased significantly among teens (Cucchiaro etal, 1974; Douglas et al, 1974; Wagenaar, 1983, 1993; Whitehead, 1977; Whitehead et al, 1975; Williams et al, 1974). With this evidence that a lower drinking age resulted in more traffic injuries and fatalities among youth, citizen advocacy groups pressured states to restore the MLDA to 21. By 1983, 16 states had increased their MLDA's back to 21 forcing the federal government to enact the Uniform Drinking Age Act because of teenagers that would travel across state lines to purchase and consume alcohol. With traffic collisions being the number one killer of teens, 28% of those fatal crashes were alcohol related. ""Each year, approximately 5,000 young people under the age of 21 die as a result of underage drinking.and about 1,900 of these deaths are from motor vehicle crashes"" (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism). In America, a teenager can receive a driver's permit at 15 and a license at 16, if we lower the minimum legal drinking age there will be a definite increase in teen drinking and driving as was seen after states lowered the age law in the 1970's.
Most teenagers graduate high school when they are 18 years old. By lowering the minimum legal drinking age, alcohol would be even more accessible to younger kids. These teenagers will have friends and siblings that are younger than they are that they associate with a on a day to day basis. It is not very hard to figure out what would happen then. The practices and behaviors of 18 year-olds are particularly influential on 15 to 17 year-olds (Alcoholpolicy MD, 2005). If 18 year-olds get the affirmative to drink, they will be modeling drinking for younger teens. A higher MLDA results in fewer alcohol-related problems among youth, and the 21-yearold MLDA saves the lives of well over 1,000 youths each year (Jones et al, 1992; NHTSA, 1989). An increase in teen drinking will negatively affect teenagers developing brains, which are still maturing in the teenage years, and that reasoning and judgment are developing well into the early to mid 20s not fully formed until age 24 (Giedd, 2004 and Treatment Research Institute, 2008). During this development, alcohol negatively affects all parts of the brain, including coordination, motional control, thinking, decision-making, hand-eye movement, speech and memory (Narcotic Education Foundation of America, Drug Abuse Education Provider of the California Narcotic Officers' Association, 2002). If the minimum legal drinking age is lowered, these functions we use countless times a day will be damaged before they are fully developed. These functions of the brain are one's that we need to lead a more successful life, if teens damage them before they are matured, just think of all the opportunities that will be missed.
America is one out of four countries to have an MLDA of 21. These other countries include: Fiji, Indonesia, Palau and the Solomon Islands. Many argue that we should have an MLDA of 18, the same as the U.K, France, Spain and other well developed countries. Regarding Europeans and alcohol use among youth, research confirms that Europeans have rates of alcohol-related diseases (such as cirrhosis of the liver) similar to or higher than those in the U.S. population (Single, 1984). Also, research showed that young people in the UK reported some of the highest levels of teenage binge drinking, drunkenness and alcohol-related problems in Europe. With these problems within European countries that have MLDA's from 16-18 years old, changing American age laws will more than likely result in the same predicaments that the UK faces.
Some arguments that are made for lowering the drinking age include the ""Forbidden Fruit"" argument, the ""Teach Responsible Drinking"" argument, and the Age of Initiation argument. The Forbidden Fruit argument claims that lowering the drinking age will reduce the allure of alcohol as a ""forbidden fruit"" for minors and will therefore make a person drink even more when they turn 21. But research suggests that lowering the MLDA will replace the ""forbidden fruit"" with ""low-hanging fruit"", which means that alcohol will be more available to a younger population. Also, early legal access to alcohol is associated with higher rates of drinking as an adult, which is the opposite of what they are claiming for this argument.
The next argument is the ""Teach Responsible Drinking"" argument, which argues that lowering the drinking age will encourage young people to be responsible consumers of alcohol, which will then give the minor an idea of tolerance and learn to drink under supervision. There is no evidence that ""indicate that kids will learn to drink responsibly simply because they are able to consume alcohol legally at a younger age. Countries with lower drinking ages suffer from alcohol-related problems similar to those in the U.S."" (alcoholpolicy, 2005). While some young people will learn to be tolerant, many teens will not learn to do so.
The last main argument is called the ""Age of Initiation"" argument. This point argues that at age 18, kids can vote; join the military, sign contracts, and even smoke. Why shouldn't they be able to drink? I am sure that this is a question that many young people ask themselves when they turn 18. If they legally become an adult, why not make their own decisions about what they can and cannot do. Well this is because ""Ages of initiation indeed vary -- one may vote at 18, drink at 21, rent a car at 25, and run for president at 35. These ages may appear arbitrary, but they take into account the requirements, risks, and benefits of each act."" (alcoholpolicy, 2005). I agree with this because you have to consider an appropriate age for a person based on an age groups maturity level. I'm sure most people would not consider a 20 year old for a position as president; some things are better left for the experienced and matured.
In conclusion, it is essential to keep America's Minimum Legal Drinking Age as is by keeping an awareness of teenager's reaction to alcohol in modern American society. We do know that the United States' experiment with an 18-year-old drinking age did not work the first time due the increase in alcohol related motor vehicle collisions when the MLDA was first lowered, the introduction of younger teens to alcohol will rise, and the problems other countries face are reason to put the idea of lowering age laws, why try it again? Experience, research and logic show why the MLDA of 21 is appropriate for the United States. So why fail twice?

"Interaction: the Significant Constituent Part in Orchestra 
For many years, concert has been viewed as a very popular and troditional entertainment for people to enjoy their leisure time. While they enjoying the concert, people get emotional, physical and artistically relax. In addition, people are more concerning in a deeper level of the performance, how does the orchestra work. As you know, the orchestra is consisted of different parts of orchestral instrument group, such as strings woodwind and brass. Although they have different melodies and not play at the same time, the orchestra could also perform a harmonic sound. What people must to know is that a successful performance does need the individual's effort, but it more depends on the interaction or the cooperation in the whole orchestra. However, some people think that if the individuals can do their jobs well, the entire orchestra will play together. So individual versus interaction, this topic has become a very controversial argument. In my opinion, in order to successfully play a harmonic sound in orchestra, the violinist should interact with the conductor while they are playing the piece. Because when you know what the others doing, you can easily follow. 
First of all, it is obvious to tell that there is no orchestra that has no conductor. According to Professor King (conductor of Purdue orchestra)'s statement, orchestral performers must play their instrument well, which is the basic requirement, and they must know how to communicate with the conductor and adjust the playing style which is more important than just playing the right notes. So the interaction in this can be specifically called communication, including verbal and nonverbal communication like eye contact that was emphasized by Professor King as the most necessary part of communication. By the eye contact, performers can match their playing style with the others and the conductor's command, such as bow direction and note length. As long as the performers build up the communication (interaction) within the section or and the conductor, the cohesive sound can be constantly and bravely performed by the player. According to my and Miss Mu's performance experiences, we all can that it is the communication that keeps our playing in time with the other players. As far as I know above 98 percent of the violinist agree that the communication helps them improving their playing experiences. Additionally, the conductors have the ability of handing out the information that they interpreted from the full score which enable them to balance the overall sound effect. But if the performers have to receive this information they must ""stare"" at the conductor other than on the music at all the time, so that they would process the information immediately and adjust themselves. 
Secondly, we all know the strength of the teamwork that can bring us the maximized effect. As Sacrnati said in his article, 2+2 can be equal to 10. That shows that the teamwork can maximize each individual's strength and combines the strength together. But how does a team successful work? The answer is clearly to say, the interaction. As in a team, all the team members are aim at the same gold and they will support each other by the interaction (Scarnati 6), for instance, the energy of one beam of light is very weak, but if you point thousands of beams of light to one point, the energy will be huge, just like the laser. Then the orchestra can perfectly follow this theory. Every player has their strengths and weaknesses, but when they are gathered in an orchestra forming a team, the final goal is play the best sound to the audience. At this time, the players will realize what are the strengths and weaknesses of themselves and maximize their strengths and minimize the weaknesses. In order to do so, the interaction plays an essential role. The players must listen carefully to the other performers who are sitting around them and then analyze and adjust their playing; so all the performers can play together and support each other. 
However, some people would like to say that if every can play every thing correctly, while they are playing together, the harmonic sound would be automatically created. Theoretically it might work but actually nobody can play everything perfectly correct, even a master violinist who has been playing the violin for his whole life. And according to the different interpretations of the conductor to the music, the way the conductor wanting the performers to play would be various but not stable, which requires that you must interact with the conductor and the other performers to make the best sound. 
As far as you know the essence of the interaction, it is undeniable to demonstrate that if an orchestra wants to create a harmonic sound, the interaction is the indispensable part of performing. So when the next time you go to a concert, you will more enjoy the fabulous sound the orchestra created, because you already know why they can make this kind of sound. And it is the interaction that keeps the orchestra, an old and new traditional entertainment, developing till today.

Is learning math for at least one year useful to Purdue Students: An argumentative essay 
As a student in the major of math in Purdue University, I have to learn math every semester. On the other hand, there are still a large number of students who are in the majors seem unrelated to math at all, like history, language, arts and so on. Many of them oppose the policy of Purdue University that every student must learn math for at least one year because of mainly two reasons: First and foremost, the calculus, which is also named 'higher mathematics' in a college is really hard in some ways; what is more, it seems that there is no relationship between math and their majors. As far as I am concerned, it is wrong because math does not only have effect on all the majors and careers, but is also able to affect human beings' everyday life. Purdue University should require all the students to learn math for at least a whole year. 
First of all, there are really a large number of students always hold the opinion that math is too hard to learn. Of course, it is no doubt that students like me in science or engineering major must learn math because it is a basic knowledge of my further learning. What is more, even it is somehow hard, we do not need to be afraid of it. According to the ""Who is fear of math"" in the book of Fear of Math: How to Get Over it and Get on with Your Life by Claudia Zaslavsky, such an opinion is called math anxiety. We do not need to worry about it because many people have the same problem because learning math requires a lot of time and effort. What is more, women are less afraid of math than men because their ability to express their feeling is better than those of men. From this fact we can learn that to solve the problem, we need to share our thoughts and emotions with each other in order to release the pressure on us. On the other hand, gifted students feel worse than common students because their expectations to themselves are stricter than others so that according to another article called Helping High Ability Students Overcome Math Anxiety through Bibliotherapy by Thomas I? Hebert and Joseph M. Furner, there is a method, bibliotherapy, which is to solve the math anxiety of gifted students. It means that the researchers let the gifted students to read books which contain characters behave like themselves. The readers may find the similarities between themselves and the figures in the book. Meanwhile, this method is suitable for not only gifted students, but also for us common students because reading is always a fantastic way to release our minds and learn from the characters inside to reflect on myself. As a conclusion, math anxiety is not only not terrible at all, but also have many ways to be solved. (Claudia Zaslavsky, 1994; Hebert & Joseph M. Furner, 1997) 
Moreover, the main reason that we need to overcome the math anxiety is math is fundamental to any careers and even our daily lives. Even for those people whose major ""seems"" unrelated to math at all, difficulty cannot be the reason of not willing to learn math. From the article ""the nonsense math effect"" in Judgment and Decision Making we can find that math is essential in the subjects like humanities, social science, medicine and many other careers like education because during the survey, many participants consider that math has a positive effect on these careers since the author made use of a statistical method called ANOVA which shows that there is a rating advantage in those careers after adding math into it. At the same time, recently I interviewed Professor <name> in my MA 351 course. As far as he is concerned, the math teaches us the way of thinking, reasoning and analyzing. Even in our daily routines, we seldom do differentiation, integral or row reduction, but the way of thinking logically affect every discrete part of our social behavior. However, such ability does not equal the knowledge in math so that it will not form right away after we learn math. Unfortunately, in the modern society, as the fast development of science and technology, a large number of people only seek the speed and efficiency so that in their minds, anything that is not immediately useful is considered useless at all. Professor Penney's foresight is far-reaching and this is rare now. Based on the sentences above, no matter what major or career we are in, math is extraordinarily important because the logic is built up by math; meanwhile, Professor Penney's opinion can still be proved by the article MATH AS THE FOUNDATION FOR HIGHER-ORDER THINKING from The Building Blocks of Success Higher-Level Math for All Students. From this essay, we know that the high-level math is an important preparation for the courses in the college because there is a large ""gap"" between high-school math education and college courses. The profound effect of first-year math education is that the rate of dropout from the college decreases obviously since it is the ""foundation"" of higher level thinking, a challenge in adulthood and the development of students' logic. From this, we conclude that it is not enough to learn math until high school because high-level math is a ""ticket"" to college learning. (Kimmo Eriksson, November 2012; Rob Muller & Alex Beatty, 2008) 
In the end, to be honest, I agree with Professor Penney and the materials that I found that math is fundamental in our lives and if someone is afraid of it, do not worry because there are really a large number of ways to solve it.

Self-Evaluation
I thought that this paper went very well. I was able to research a topic I was interested in. I learned a lot about how complicated different issues can be. It is hard to find a clear-cut solution to a problem like global warming, but by having a paradigm shift in my thinking, I was able to see a solution to the problem that is not very commonly considered. The paper itself came out to be about the length that I planned it to be, and the use of separate sections helped to make the paper have a more logical layout. Also, I was able to find useful visuals that strengthened my paper.

"Ashes is a test series played between Australia and England once every four year. Since its inception, the series of 1932 has been the most controversial series mainly due to England using the bodyline to win over their counter parts. Due to the physically threating nature of bodyline deliveries, this tactic gained widespread attention and criticism both in public as well as the media. Even though most of the cricketing world believe that the use of bodyline has led to England's victory, some believe that the English played better cricket in order to snatch the ashes from the Australians. England won the ashes because they played better cricket, not because of bodyline. 
Firstly, in practice, bodyline is a kind of leg theory where balls would be bowled towards the leg side (bodies) of the batsmen and fielders would be placed accordingly in order to stop the run flow. Even before 1932 series, West Indian pace bowlers used this tactic. Therefore, this tactic was not something that was invented but it was used more extensively during the 1932 series. Bodyline gained widespread attention mainly due to reporters and analysts who used the term ""Bodyline"" instead of leg theory to grab attention. Secondly, bodyline nullifies the advantage that batsmen naturally had due to the nature of the sport. It is believed that bodyline bowling gave the bowlers an unfair edge over the batsmen. During that era, cricketing laws were mostly in favor of the batsmen. Since ball change laws were not present, batsmen could freely score runs after the ball became soft due to wear and tear. Body line bowling was one of the ways that this advantage could be nullified and maintain balance in the game. Thirdly, bodyline was not used extensively during the ashes of 1932. According to sports reporter Massie, of all the legal deliveries, about 10-15% were short pitched and directed towards the batsmen. Most importantly, these deliveries put the batsmen in discomfort but rarely were wicket taking balls. The total amount of wickets taken by bodyline deliveries were very limited. The most important reason for England's victory was that they had a better team. The Australian team was dependent on Sir Don Bradman to fire but overall quality of the team was below that of the English. Moreover, the English team had a great bowling line up which was far superior to the Australian's. The Australian team relied on a few part time bowlers rather than seasoned fast bowlers. Thus English team was able to post big totals and put pressure on the Australian's. (Massie) 
The main reason why body line is still considered to be the reason for England's victory is due the physically threating nature of the tactic. Body line forced batsmen to play at deliveries generating chances for taking wickets. Yes it's true that bodyline was physically threating mainly because the protective equipment during that period was not sophisticated enough to protect the batsmen. Yet most of the batsmen had a problem facing the pace rather than the bounce. Moreover the bounce of the ball was limited when the ball turned soft. 
Even though it is believed that bodyline was a major factor in England's ashes victory. In reality, England team played better cricket and used better strategy to win the Ashes. The significance of this tactic is immense to the evolution to the sport. Since the ashes, the attitude towards a change has been mostly negative. New inventions such as switch hits, scoops, reverse hits have been criticized. But people need to know that these form of innovative tactics enhance the sport rather than violating the spirit of the game.

Contrast Opinions for Developing a Human Clone 
	Growth of scientific field brought convenience in our lives; however, it also fetched devastation of humanity. Developing a human clone is a one of the most popular issue in scientific field. With its development, we can expect to have benefits like expansion of medical treatment, but we cannot also disregard the disadvantages it will result. Thus, I dissent to develop a human clone. 
	If human clone is developed, confusion in the society will be the first outcome. People will be in social chaos to differentiate clone and its entity. Since clone has exactly same genes with its entity, the security system developed currently such as voice recognition, iris recognition, and even fingerprint recognition cannot ban its clones to pass the security. This can result crimes including larceny, robbery, and larceny. If these crimes happens frequently, people will not only be in confusion, but also be in dread of society. 
	In addition, since clone can be made infinitely, people will try to take organs or body parts out from the clones to sell. This will result an anarchy and ethical problems. Imprudent embryo harvest will eventually cause commercialization of embryo and stem cell. Harris (1998) says that the idea of wrongful use may occur when there are financial needs by exploiting one another with thinking each other as a sex object. If selling embryos gets popular and becomes a profitable business, people will try to exploit not only embryos but also organs and other body parts to make as much profit as possible. Consequently, it is feasible to endanger women who can be pregnant by exploitation to provide embryos 
Moreover, wealthy people could regard people as object that can be reproduced or replaced by clones. Then, emergence of ranks among people based on their wealth would be realized. Like the movie, 'Hunger Game', wealthy people will be able to buy clones and make them to kill each other by calling it as a 'game' or a 'new type of sport'. Cruelty of human will be extreme to cause many other ethical issues. 
Besides, the good treatment after the death of clone is also very hard to find. Even though a clone has its own personality, it is derived from a human, its entity. It is why killing a clone after its duty is a biggest issue to discuss before developing it. We need to respect the human rights, but clone is not in the category of human and the border between human and its clone is quite obscure. Also, there is no current plans to treat the defective clone such as a clone with six legs or three heads, and a clone having fifty years old physical ability but five years sold mental ability. The treatments for its side effects are not prepared yet. Furthermore, if human clone can have their own identity and have negative feelings toward the real human, it is possible to result the collapse of the world and extinction of human as predicted in many scientific movies. 
To sum up, as mentioned above, there are many possible ethical and political problems by developing a human clone such as confusion in society, exploitation of human body, and unplanned rules for faulty clones. Therefore, because developing a human clone have many defects for now, I disagree to develop a human clone.

"Today, as the economic and social life develops, our new technology is becoming more advanced than before. These advanced technologies also make our life convenient and comfortable, especially our education. About 20 years ago, there was no any online-education during the world. With the advent of the Internet, educators discovered a new medium for communicating with students. Throughout the 1990s, online education evolved from basic corporate computer-based training programs to be embraced by colleges and universities across the country. As technology continues to advance, so does the nature of online education.
I still remembered that when I was a child, about 7or8 years, we went to school and take the class, there is no internet, no keyboard, no computer. We just listen the teacher's class and took notes. It is difficult time but I enjoyed it. But now, as you see, almost all school have their own online-education during our world. Including almost project, Language, Math, Physics, Chemical and some specialized courses. In my home country China, I know about 70 percent primary school had already built their own internet education for our students. It is very excited that our students can learn some interested knowledge online instead of go to the school. For example, my PIE teacher often give us the homework online or remind us what we will bring something tomorrow class. Like research, homework, worksheet or some reading logs. So now, I checked my E-mail every day and see some important E-mails. I think it is a better way to remind me what is the next step.
Although today it is trend that more and more school prefer to choose the internet education for our students, there are also many amid opposition. They believe that when these students have online-education, they will be not control themselves. And also it is said the internet is not safe enough. As we know, everyday there are lots of knowledge during our life, and when you read them, you also read some article maybe including violence, pornographic, crime and gangster dom. These themes bring our students many counteractive, because they were too young to understand what is good and what is bad. They will learn these from the internet when they take the internet education. But, the other people said even if there are so many disadvantage during the internet, but we can not ignore the internet bring us the benefits, especially the internet education for our students.
If we want to talk about the internet education, I think we should better to understand what internet education is. According to ""Introduction of the Internet Education"", it said online education is a form of distance learning that emphasizes the use of a personal computer. Students take courses via the Internet and utilize a variety of audio and video technologies to enhance their electronic communication with instructors. Of course, there are some hybrid educations courses that allow students to complete a portion of their work online, but also require in-class sessions. So from this website, we know about how to define the internet education.
As our invention develops, our internet education is growing quickly. According to a recent study by the Sloan Consortium, a nonprofit organization that analyzes online learning trends. The number of people taking advantage of online education is increasing by about 13 percent each year. In comparison, enrollments at traditional colleges and universities are growing by only 1. 2 percent a year. Additionally, more and more private and public colleges and universities are offering online courses. In the fall of 2007, more than 3. 9 million students were taking at least one course online. As for our students, it is a useful to improve our class. For example, my school, NAU has also the online courses. It is very important that we can keep our class online when we decided to go back our country in the summer holiday. Because when you live in Phoenix in the summer, it is too hot. And the NAU give us this chance that we can keep our class online when we live at home.
So I think it is a better way to keep our project. So, I think Internet has changed our lives and it is not different for students. The World Wide Web offers a wealth of information which can be useful for every kind of information. Many students don't need to visit the library for research because you can find plenty of encyclopedia's (for example, the Brit-anicca encyclical) and many education sites when you browse through different Internet sites. Today, you will find almost all our students use the online education for their homework or research and so on. Also our professor can assign the homework online, and we can do it online. It is also a example putting the right keywords in the search engines is already a good start to find the necessary information. It doesn't mean you don't need books anymore but Internet add a certain value to the information students get at school. It is even impossible to imagine any education today without Internet use. Almost every school has some computers which has access to Internet and students can use these computers for research which may help them to make their daily tasks.
Today, there are also problems during our internet education. But before we face these problems, we should better to understand the benefits of the internet education. According a article named ""How the Internet is Revolutionizing Education"". This article is talked about how the internet education development. It is also can take the benefits for our students' life. From this article, the main supporting points are some revolutionizing examples, the author talked about some vital resources, such as ""Open Culture"" ""Khan Academy"" ""Academic Earth"" ""P2PU"" 'Skill Share"" and so on. For these parts, we know about how the internet is revolutionizing our education. In my opinion, in these ways, it can also useful for our students' life, especially their teachers'. Otherwise, according to a book that talked about the internet education. It is named ""The Advantages of Internet in Education"" The author is Sue Turner. The author believe that the internet education can make our students' life more convenience and comfortable than before. It also talked about Communication, School Projects and Homework, News, Students' Future, Benefits for Teachers.
Communication: The Internet helps students develop their computer skills. It can also help students with their writing skills. In some forms, the Internet can help students with critical thinking skills. For example, our students can use the internet in order to improve their computer skills. When they have in trouble with the computer, the teacher can teach them online.
School Projects and Homework: The Internet can be a huge source for children trying to look up information for a school project or do homework. It also eliminates barriers for handicapped students who may have trouble getting to a library. As for me, I am happy that the teacher assigns the homework online. I can do it online and give back them. It is can save much time.
News: The Internet allows students to read the latest news of a certain subject they are studying. If they are studying American politics they can do a news search and find out what is happening in the world of politics at that very moment. This can help them connect what they are learning to the real world. As we know, the news can spread faster and faster online. So maybe it helps our students keep interested in their class.
Student's Future: Students will have to use the computer for research in college, in their jobs and their everyday lives. The Internet is a way of life for almost everyone now. In my opinion, using it in a classroom is one of the best and safest ways to help them learn about this tool.
Benefits for Teachers: The Internet is an added bonus for teachers looking for more information on subjects. It allows them to efficiently communicate with parents and other teachers through email. For our teachers, they can have their own class pages that parents can check at their convenience to see what is going on in the classroom.
In this article, they are connected to a specific organization is the government agency in United States. The other side is that what about the teachers' work, is it easy or difficult when they use the internet education. We think about that it is very easy when these teachers use the internet education, because they can check the homework on line and give back the grade to the students. Popular Online Formats, it can explains why is the internet popular now. I think it and the following are the most common types of online education courses:
Adult Online Education: The U.S. Department of Education's Division of Adult Education and Literacy promotes education programs that "" help American adults get the basic skills they need to be productive workers, family members, and citizens."" It's easy to find such programs online. Adult online education is geared toward teaching basic math, science, reading, and problem solving skills. They often focus on fighting illiteracy and teaching language skills.
Hybrid Education:A hybrid education combines the use of online coursework and materials with traditional in-class education. In hybrid courses, students can learn from teachers in a face-to-face setting as well as via the Internet.
Online Continuing Education: This type of online education offers an array of different classes for students who already have a degree but need (or want) to take one or two specific classes in order to advance their skills in a certain area. Continuing education courses do not lead to a degree upon completion.
These are the main ideas about that articles, I think the Wide Web offers a wealth of information which can be useful for every kind of information. Almost all students can find their interested information online, they can do it online, or find interested information out the class. There is so much that students can do with the Internet. Not only can they communicate with international students, they can gain from others' knowledge and experiences, participate in chatrooms, share ideas and solutions and learn about the many diverse cultures out there.
While the Internet does a lot for students, there are also benefits for parents and teachers. The interactive learning that the Internet provides can help students and parents with little or no English skills to learn English. Parents can become more involved in their childrens' education by connecting the school with homes, libraries or other access ports.
It is also good for our teacher, according to a website named "" Internet Has Many Benefits"", Teachers have the chance to be able to teach at more than one place simultaneously. They may be in a small town but through the Internet, they can be linked to students in more populated areas. Also, the Internet enables administrators and teachers to spend less time on administration and record keeping. This would also give them more time to spend with their students.
On the other side, there are disadvantages about the internet education. So from some article and websites, it talked about some disadvantage for the internet education. In conclusion, there are three main basic disadvantages of online education.
One disadvantage would have to be that in the job market, it is highly likely that your online degree will not stand the real diplomas and degrees that you can get. With the best kind of options it tends to get a whole lot easier. You will be assured only the best kind of education online if you pick up the right courses. I think in this way, it is not clearly to remind you what you learned in the class, or the school. According to a newspaper ""China Daily"", it said many students want to learn their knowledge online but it might not get a complete exposure to the process of class room teaching.
Furthermore, the largest problem is that people face when the online education is the technical skills. As we might know, today our internet education is also in the initial stage, we can not understand how the internet education development now is. For certain subjects at least it becomes relevant to download the right kind of software. When this is well taken care of it gets easier to ensure that the relevant subjects are taught properly. Once you enroll for a course the process becomes a whole lot easier. You will be guaranteed the best kind of work opportunities.
Finally, the most problem is that when you are studying in an educational institution, there is fixed time table and scheduled classes which you are required to attend. This is exactly opposite of what happens when you are opting for an online course. You do not need to follow any restrictions. In many instances students do not feel motivated enough when it comes to online education. That tends to make it extremely difficult and as a result of this people opt out of their online courses.
So I think these are the most problem of the internet education. Even if there are also many disadvantage of it, but in my opinion, it is very useful for our students' and teachers' life in the future. With the increasing use of the Internet as a means of delivering education, the roles of teachers and students are being redefined in the online learning environment (Bates, 2000; Wade, 1994). In this setting, students play an active role in their learning process and assert their autonomy in self-directed learning activities. Concomitantly, teachers become facilitators whose primary role is to promote a positive environment for collaborative learning and provide necessary support (Wade; 1994; Harrington & Oliver, 2001). So, for my essay, I talked about the advantage and the disadvantage of the internet education, some people said it is very useful because it can change our students' life in the future and bring us the convent and comfort, but others believe that the internet education is harmful for our students life.
It is a better way to learn some knowledge that we had never seen or heard before, and we can met every kinds of people from all over the world. We can learn together and make good friends. Even if we have the different language and different culture, but we can learn from each other, you also find some interested information that you might never learned in the class. And how about the teacher, they can sign up the homework online and E-mail to the students. The students can do it and go back to the teacher online, I think in this way it can save much time. Also the teacher can use the internet education to show the advance the video that the students interested in. We can watch video online about this class, maybe the students can understand the class clearly. So, I think the internet education is very good for our life, especially for our students' and teachers' life in the future.

Should Laptops Replace Tablets 
According to tendency of technological development and people's preference, I believe laptops will replace tablets. This is because laptops with high performance are more practical and improved constantly at the same time. They have much more potential value than tablets. Moreover, the sale of tablets does not look optimistic. 
In addition, tablets were invented by experiencing a long process, but the sale of them did not look optimistic. Sharples, M., and Beale, R made a technique review in 2003. Pen tablet computers were come up by Kay and Goldberg in 1970. And they became realistic in 1990. Microsoft invented pen tablet computers with sensitive color screen, stylus, docking stations, and infrared keyboards. They were used widely. In 2002, Microsoft improved them: an active digitizer instead of a resistive(touch) digitizer, legacy-free, rotating the display between landscape and portrait without rebooting, restarting in less than 2 seconds, working for 72 hours, automatically saving on battery exhaustion, and permitting removal from a dock. New operating system offered lots of more specific features. And then a number of manufactures began to produce their own tablet computers with distinct characteristics. Sale targets were teachers and students in education field. However, Wakabayashi, D., & Ovide, S. researched i Pad in 2014. i Pad was born in 2010. After i Pad appeared on the market, the question came so quickly. Sale of i Pad was always low. And then experts in Apple Company found it was not necessary. People just wanted it, and people who wanted it had already had it. Moreover, with size of smartphones' screen increasing and laptops' screen reducing, sale of i Phone and Mac rose rapidly while sale of i Pad exacerbated to fall off. For fixing this, firm IDC changed outlook and invented new tablets. Indeed, this way increased their sale but had little effects. Now, a number of countries did not purchase enough tablets to compensate those tablets which had been produced. Hence, people spent a lot of time and money to invent tablets, but their sales were disappointing. 
Admittedly, tablets are much more portable than laptops and people have already known how to upgrade them. There is <name>'s experience. <name> had a 17-inche laptop and an 11-inche professional tablet. He prefers carrying his tablet everywhere, especially to classes and meetings. Because the tablet is lighter and smaller than his laptop, he can carry it for the whole day without flagging. Besides, it has a professional pen which can sense 1024 levels pressure. With the higher number, the pen can store handwriting more accuracy. Whatever he writes down, it will record as he writes on the paper. In classes, he always takes notes by his tablet instead of paper. Besides, <name> and Mr. Jing explained direction of tablets' improvement. <name> said, people need to invent a much more powerful CPU with a very low TDP (Thermal Design Power) and seek for a new type battery to strengthen the device's running time."" In terms of laptops, tablets have much lower performance, smaller display, and inferior acoustics, which are even worse for eyes. Moreover, Mr. Jing referred to other aspects. More practical accessories need to be produced, like portable keyboards and styluses. Besides, more websites and apps have their distinguished tablets' version to be suitable for touch-operation, especially some office softwares, like Office of tablets' version. These advanced office apps can make up the shortage of tablets. Thus, tablets are more convenient than laptops and they are upgrade directly. 
At last, nowadays, a new type of a laptop, Ultrabook, is extremely prevalent. It is light and portable as tablets and as powerful as traditional laptops. Also, lots of Ultrabooks can transform tablets. Some can split into two parts, the touch screen and the keyboard. Others can flip the touch screens to face up. In fact, he has an Ultrabook which can flip touch screen, and he thinks that it is really beneficial in some conditions. Mr. Hu also mentioned the 2-in-1 device whose screen can dismantling from the keyboard when people want to use it as a tablet, or when people prefer the high performance, they can just insert the screen part to the keyboard to make it become a full functional laptop. I think this is a big breakthrough. Ultrabook combines both advantages of tablets and laptops. It probably will overtake both tablets and laptops. 
Although tablets are much more portable than laptops, laptops have higher performance and more people's preference, doing most tasks which tablets can do. Tablets were popular ever, just because people wanted to purchase them not really needed them. And then there might be a new type of device, Ultrabook, replacing tablets as well as laptops in the future, with advanced technology. It combines both benefits of tablets and laptops.

"Does Fast food should be banned? 
With our busy lifestyles, eating fast food has become a very convenient way to satisfy one's hunger. However, fast food includes low nutritional value, high sodium and sugar content, and high fat and calories, which are very serious issue nowadays. Statistic shows that the nutritional value of fast food consumed by children in Australia is gradually decrease over the past 30 years. 1 It means fast food is one of factors that threaten public health. I believe it should be blamed and banned for causing significant health problems in our body. 
	First of all, Fast food should be banned because it is unhealthy. Fast food, containing fat, salt, and sugar, is the reason for obesity. In recent day, younger generation is the largest consumer group of fast food. ""Childhood obesity is particularly troubling because the extra pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once confined to adults.""2 Continuously, childhood obesity can increase the risks of heart disease in their future. 
	Secondly, fast food causes behavioral disturbance in children. Fast food, containing chemical substances, flavorings, and preservatives, extend the expiration date. Moreover, those chemical additives design to make the food more appetizingly. However, these chemical additives cause the behavioral disturbances, such as hyperactivities (ADHD)3 and pour concentration. Base on my researching, these results demonstrated that fast food affects significant health problems in our body. 
	Finally, most of fast food companies are large scale and worldwide. Their fast food advertisement displayed on TV every day. More advertising, more consumption is natural. However, the wide spreading of fast food does not make good effect in much aspect. Large-scale Fast Food Company destroys the originality or locality in the other countries. It means food diversity is disappeared by multinational fast food. 
	On the other points of view, people disagree with the fast food containing low nutritional value because there is a case what person actually lived on fast food alone. Also, they believe the reason of behavioral problem is birth defect. Even though their ideas are really creative, they do not wish to tangle with others for their health problems. 
	In conclusion, consuming fast food can satisfy one's hunger, but cannot satisfy one's health.

Chinese students at Purdue University: if they should step out their ethnic community 
The importance of adjusting and fitting into American culture and college life is undebatable. However, there are always international students who are unwilling to step out their own ethnic community and to embrace the local community. The Chinese student body at Purdue University is a very good case for this study, because Purdue has one of the largest undergraduate international student bodies, with the Chinese student population upholds approximately one-tenth of entire student body. Furthermore, myself, as an undergraduate student at Purdue, have the opportunity to interview many of my Chinese upper classmates, friends, and experienced academic advisors for their point of views. During the research, I heard two different kinds of voices, one claim that it is unnecessary for Chinese students to step out their ethnic community, while the other one denies. 
Before look at the two different views, we must first look at the purpose of this argument and research, and the backgrounds of how Chinese students are doing in 
American colleges. Purdue, although has been known as a melting pot, many Chinese students have not truly melted together in this melting pot. After the first semester of studying at Purdue, I found that my Chinese friends would prefer to go to lunch with the other Chinese, sitting at an all-Chinese student table. And during labs and study sessions, they would also work only with their Chinese friends. Additionally, they seem not care much of the school events like football games or musical concerts. The topics they enjoy discussing the most are always about the best Chinese restaurant in town, the latest 
Chinese TV shows, or some Chinese club events like karaoke competition. Some of my Chinese friends tell me that they feel more comfortable this way, and they do not see the meaning of making American friends on purpose. Because they will eventually go back to China after four years of undergraduate study and will never see those American people again anyway; why would they even bother to make these friends then? Some of my friends argue that the American community is neither friendly nor welcome toward foreigners, so that they feel uncomfortable to join it. This phenomenon is not only happening at Purdue, but also many other colleges across the States. According to an interview to some undergraduate students from University of Iowa by CNN in February 2015, almost all the international students have had the feeling of being isolated by the other American students. One student from the interview refused to even talk to his 
American classmates after being mocked for his Chinese accent, and he was told by his American classmates to go back to China. Some of them got very bad depression because of this, and some of them just gave up and dropped out of college because they could not handle this kind of embarrassment anymore. 
According to my friends at Purdue who had the similar experience as the previous paragraph has mentioned, they argue that it was not their fault to not fit into American culture. Instead, it was the American community that keeps them from fit in. And time after time, they kind of just tired to try hard to fit themselves in. They would rather to stay in their own ethnic community. 
On the other hand, according to my academic advisor, Mr. <name> , who has been advising many undergraduate international students from their freshmen year to their senior year, fitting into American college life is essential for international students. In the interview, <name> states that studying abroad should include both the experience inside the classroom and the activities and fun with local friends after classes; the international students should learn both culturally and academically. <name> also states that the Purdue is blessed to have so many international students, and the university is trying hard to help international students to fit into American college life better. The university provides new student orientation program ""BGR"" and ""BGRi"" for example, programs the university offered to all the domestic and international incoming freshmen, helping them to get to know each other before the school get started. During the orientation program, there is variety of activities to help the international students to get use to American college systems, and games help them to know each other's background better. Additionally, there are also many American student organizations that are looking forward to recruit international students. <name> suggests that Chinese students should not only limit themselves with Chinese organizations but also American ones. 
From this interview with Mr. <name> , it seems totally different than those Chinese students' view from previous paragraph. There seems to be many friendly American people and organizations there to help international students. According to <name> , it seems like to be Chinese students' wrong to limit themselves with Chinese student organizations and clubs. However, In my point of view the Chinese student organizations can usually offer more help than harm. But it is also true that these organizations can create ethnic community, which isolates them from the rest of domestic community. According to an old journal written by Walter J. Ballard (1909), the article Chinese Students In America, and published by Trustees of Boston University, Chinese student had this long tradition of gathering as a ethnic group ever since last century. Back in 1901, some of the Chinese students attending the university in the States founded the organization name of the Chinese Students' Alliance of America, which is very like today's Chinese Students & Scholars Association. The Alliance of America also publishes the Chinese Students' Monthly, a magazine in English and the Chinese 
Students' Annual, in Chinese, with a goal of uniting all Chinese students on the broad. 
Additionally, they had many local club activities in their own colleges such as Berkeley, 
New Haven, Amherst, Illinois, Chicago, Wisconsin, Cornell, Penn, Michigan and Colombia. In my opinion, if Chinese students already had this long tradition of gathering as organization, why would we bother to force ourselves to leave something that we are comfortable with. And I do not think this would undermine the path toward fitting into 
American college life. Instead, I think both Chinese and American organizations are equally important for college life. Because they can both help Chinese students to adjust life here in the states. 
Still, many Chinese students are not willing to step out their ethnic community; they think it is better for them to not step out their comfort zone. Even though it is beneficial for Chinese students to learn more about American college life and culture, nobody can force them to do so. Despite all the reasons they can give to refuse embrace American culture. What we can do is respect their own decisions, try to be good models for them, embrace American culture by ourselves first, and the others might follow our action. After doing this research, I had a better picture of how and why Chinese students are unwilling to step out the ethnic community. But after all, as international students, I think we still should try our best to embrace the foreign culture. Otherwise, what is the point of studying abroad? If we do not step out our ethnic circle, what would be the difference between of attending college in America and studying the international courses that are taught by the American professors at the Chinese university?

"Entrepreneurship 
Nowadays entrepreneurship is pursued by more and more people. Although it is argued that successful entrepreneur are supposed to drop off from college to start business, it is my personal view that it would be much more profitable to start business after tertiary education for several reasons, of which recognizing promising opportunity, generating good idea, accurately analyzing feasibility and writing a inspiring business plan are evident. 
The first reason is that people with college education can recognize more promising opportunities than people who did not. According to the The Entrepreneurial Journey: From Entrepreneurial Intent to Opportunity Realization the first essential thing to develop a business is recognizing an opportunity (44). To find a promising opportunity, an entrepreneur needs to be familiar with the environmental trends and business trends. People who graduated from college learned more knowledge about the trends, and analyze it more comprehensively. On contrast, people without enough knowledge about business may miss one of the trends, which includes economic trends, social trends, technological advances and political and regulatory changes. Even if they know they need to find out the trends, they do not know how to analyze it, and they would predict wrong trends, which is devastating for a new business. Furthermore, Cha, M.-S. and Bae, Z.-T says that the window of the opportunity must be open, so that entrepreneur can enter. This means when a product is established, its window of opportunity opens. As the times goes on, the market matures, and window of opportunity closes. Search engine is a good example, because today it is very hard to create a new search engine firm that can compete with Google, unless entering a niche market (Cha, M.-S. and Bae, Z.-T). college students have plenty resource about cut-edge research, which is way ahead than other resource. One step ahead finding opportunity means success and one step behind is failure. 
The second reason is that individuals who have tertiary education can accurately analyze the feasibility of business. Doing a feasibility analysis is not easy, and it has four key areas: product/service feasibility, industry/market feasibility, organizational feasibility, and financial feasibility (79-81). People need to analyze those feasibilities one by one, and if one of all fails, the business fails. Both primary and secondary researches are needed to conduct analyzing feasibilities. Compared with people who did not attend college, college students did a lot of research and analyzed data, so they are experienced and skilled to do feasibility analysis, and thus they have higher chance of winning in the business. Moreover, Bruce R Barringer said some entrepreneurs jump directly from recognizing idea to writing business plan, but it is important to test feasibility of a business idea before write a plan (79-81). People without college education tend to skip this step, because some of them, without attending business class, do not even know there is a step of feasibility analysis. Without doing so, the risk of failure is much higher. 
The third reason is that well-educated people can write better business plan. Business plan is really important. First, writing a business plan is conducive to the founders consider systematically the business which they want to launch and develop a concrete blueprint. Second, writing a business plan will be very helpful to create a selling document for a company, which need to present to anglel investors, potential partners, and someone else who will produce significant on the new business venture ( Liao, Jianwen (Jon) and Gartner, William). People with college education are usually more skilled in writing, so do this important document. With a promising business plan, entrepreneur can get more money from venture investment, trusts and helps from angel investor, also they can follow the business plan running business consistently. 
All in all, by following these three steps of recognizing a business idea, testing the feasibility of the idea and writing a business plan, entrepreneurs with tertiary education will have more probability to get a successful start. The feat of accomplishing a good start of the new venture, which will inevitably reduce the chance of enduring business failing and contribute to a high speed development. The entire feat that entrepreneurs achieve above will conducive to even more solid achievement. This is virtuous cycle toward a company booming.

"The Best Way To Control Feral Cat Problem 
	Feral cat population problem is a serious problem. Feral cats not only hunt other species that causing ecosystem unbalanced, but also spread disease that can even influence human health. In order to solve feral cat issue to protect other endanger animals and human lives, couples of solutions have been considered: TNR program, TVHR program and killing method. Although killing method is the fastest and most efficient way to deal with this problem, considering the both efficiency and humanity, TVHR should be carried out rather than killing method. 
	For a long period, Trap, Neuter and Return, also called TNR program has been used to control feral cat number as a human way. How ever, through out computer model, TNR will work only if over 57% feral cats are involved in TNR program, which is almost impossible because feral cats have a very large population in one colony. According to SPCA studies, the number of feral cats in the U.S is estimated to be in the tens of millions, and that is why TNR could not really work in long term. 
	Due to the ineffective TNR program, there is another point of view that suggests killing the feral cats instead of neutering them. Although killing method do have strong power reducing feral cat number, this method is strongly objected by animal lovers who believe that it is so cruel and inhuman to other creature. Since the source of feral cat issue is people's abandonment of unaltered cats, how can we make up our own fault by massacring innocent creature? Therefore, in order to make ends meet both effect and humanity, TVHR is the best way to control feral cat problem.

"Argumentative essay 
People used to only focus on satisfying hunger problem. However, much more often than in the past, people's condition of life quality has already improved obviously because of the development of society. People are more likely take care of the healthy diet. For this topic, different people hold the different concept of it in their mind. Some vegetarians think healthy diet is only consist of vegetables and fruits while others not. In my point of view, balanced diet which consists of diverse food should be better for people. And I would give three specific evidences to support my opinion. 
First, the balanced diet can help people control their weight. Eating the balanced diet can keep people in a proper weight, which means people would reduce the possibility of obesity or undernutrition. It is hard for people only have fruits and vegetables in long term, they are easily to feel hungry and want to eat everything to satisfy their physical demand. They cannot stop eating while they have a big meal. This remind me of an example around me in high school. <name> is a girl who has a little babyfat, and she only ate one apple per day, however, if she started to eat something else, she cannot stop eating, because she has already stay in hunger for one week. This would be harmful to her stomach, and she did not lose weight as she expected before. 
Second, in term of disease, a well-balanced diet would helpful to reduce the risk of disease and infections. People get different nutrients from the diverse food, it is true that vegetables and fruits are good for people's health, but it doesn't mean other food doesn't have nutrients. Such like meat, cheese and other kinds of food, they also have the nutritional elements which lack in the vegetables and fruits. In this way, when the body receives enough and overall nutritional elements, it means the immune system is well, which can avoid the infections, and decrease the risk of disease, like cancer, high blood pressure, heart diseases, etc. 
Finally, speaking of the development of physical health, a balanced diet can promote one's body growth. Since get enough necessary nutritional elements not only can prevent the disease, but also can help body to grow and stay the function. Especially aim to young people and children. For instance, fish and eggs have abundant protein. According to the resource, protein is extraordinarily essential for body growth and tissue repair as well as healing of injuries. If one lack the protein, he or she is more likely to get heart problems, arthritis, muscle soreness, hair loss, low quality of sleep, etc. Based on my cousin's experience, she lose weight in high school by skipping meal, and only eat vegetables and fruits, however, her possibility to get illness much more often than before. Faced to the hard schoolwork, her health condition became bad. Luckily, she changed her meal plan on time, and she said that she felt much more energetic than before.

High School Testing, What a Waste of Time
As American citizens everyone is entitled to things called civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, religion, and privacy. Every now and again these liberties are challenged. One big challenge that American citizens are currently facing is drug testing in high school, the tests are mainly focusing on students that participate in after hour activities such as sports or clubs, but affect more than just the student athletes they affect the community as a whole. It is the responsibility as citizens to defend the civil liberties that are granted to them, they must protect the rights of the youth in America as well. The drug tests pose more problems than just ethical ones, cost is a big factor in these tests. The tests are very expensive to administer. The students of America have a lot of pressures on them without the added weight of ""random"" drug tests. These tests do not just only affect students but it also affects communities as a whole. Where do you think the money comes from to perform these tests? Taxpayer dollars should not go towards testing high school students, it just is not a good way to spend the taxpayers dollars. Testing high school athletes is an ineffective way to spend money, its unethical and it does not efficiently deter student athletes from using drugs and steroids.
The cost of testing our student athletes is a main deterrent to the public when it comes to implementing plans for a universal testing system. The facts on the matter are that testing athletes for steroids is just not a good way for people to spend their money. Some states have actually tried this out like Florida and Texas with unpleasant results. Texas in particular has tested tens of thousands of young athletes mainly those who compete in football and girls volleyball. The first ten thousand tests however found only four positive results (Dallas Morning News). This is where the whole problem with drug testing lies, in regards to cost. Why would a country bother to waste its money on testing its high school athletes if they were only going to find four positive results? Four out of ten thousand is not even one whole percent, with the results as bad as they are states should just cut the whole program. The problem with the program that Texas has is that its price tag is $6 million dollars. This makes it easy for critics to disagree with testing. Why have tests when they aren't even bringing back results? Some fans of the program say that it isn't results they want to see, but without results there is no proof to the effectiveness of the tests. Republican state Senator Dan Patrick of Houston, has been a vocal critic of the tests, calling them a ""colossal waste of taxpayer money"" that could be better spent battling recreational drug and alcohol use among teens (Dallas Morning News 1). Even though it may seem like a good plan to keep all schools testing it just isn't feasible to do so. For example keeping the current plan in Texas going would cost each school an extra $4,709 every two years (Dallas Morning News). This may not seem like a lot but people must think about schools in rural areas that really can't afford such costs. Especially when they could spend their money on reducing gang violence or something that is better for their community, for example better technology for the schools like new computers and science labs. Especially in today's society the U.S. economy can't afford to be spending dollars in places where it isn't useful. In Florida they stopped their pilot steroid testing program because of the lack of resulting positive tests. The state only found 1 positive test out of 600 teens tested State officials said that in the tough economy, they couldn't justify spending the $100,000. The tests in Florida were randomly administered at 53 schools, each test was $166 (Gainesville). Because the states aren't giving states money schools are using grant money to test the student athletes, that may seem alright until the other uses of that money are realized. For example new athletic fields and gymnasiums could be crated with the grant money, using that money for steroid testing is a very illegitimate use of grant money. Cristina Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the Florida Athletic Association puts it into good perspective when she says, ""we completely understand, we know that money has to go to certain things right now to help the entire state, not just one association.""(Gainesville). It is that understanding that the population needs to have on the subject. The cost of the tests is just one factor of the total cost involved. Other costs that would arise from steroid testing would be payments to the people that issue the tests and payments to the companies that read the tests. At one glance you would think that just anyone could issue these tests, but that is not the case. Training goes into learning how to administer the test and only professionals are allowed to give the tests. This poses a problem because these costs aren't included in programs budgets, such as the program in Texas. Now some would argue that this would be a good thing because it would give more people jobs, but it does not happen that way. Because steroid testing is just a seasonal thing it would mean that people would be forced to go through specialized training to only work for a span of around three months. So all of the time and money that was put into the program would go to waste because the jobs are solely short term. The issue of steroid testing does however go deeper than just cost, there are other factors that go into it.
Another big factor in this whole issue is the ethics of invading the privacy of American high school students. As citizens in the United States people have the right to privacy from the public. If these testes were standardized then it would mean that high school students don't have the same rights as every other citizen in the U.S.? It is unfair to test high school students on what they do when they are not in school. If parents choose to administer tests to their children then that is one thing but when a public identity such as a school district steps in that is crossing the line. Targeted steroid testing misses the mark because of what it tells the youth of America. It is telling young adults that because you choose to be a part of extra-curricular activities you are subject to having your rights revoked. That can't be the lesson that America wants its children to have, or can it? The American Academy of Pediatrics had this to say on the subject.
""We are also concerned about the effects of this potential invasion of an adolescent's privacy. Some students will sit in class studying our constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure and then be compelled to produce a urine specimen against their will. What is the lesson here? Drug testing is best employed as a routine component of a drug treatment program to ensure maintenance of abstinence."" This is a very clear and precise way to look at this situation. On one hand drug testing is a good thing, it can help someone who has had previous bouts with addiction remain clean knowing that they will be tested soon. But for football and volleyball players to be subject to these tests is more than just, not right, it is an invasion of privacy which is given to each citizen with the fourth amendment. To deny this to the students of America is irresponsible and should not be allowed. When children go to school they are not just there to learn academically. Today in high school more learning goes on outside the classroom. Kids learn how to interact with others and make decisions on their own. If the opportunity to use drugs happens it should be that child's decision whether or not to use them. Hopefully the child's parents have prepared them enough to make the correct choice. Drug testing can be used to scare these children away from the thoughts of trying drugs, but no matter what happens in the end it is up to the student and how they were raised. Just like in everyday life people break laws even though they know there are consequences, not everyone breaks the laws though because they know better than to do that. Schools may like to think that they have a power in stopping kids from using drugs and steroids but they really don't the decision lies in the hands of the student.
Accuracy of drug testing is another problem offered up by random drug testing in high school. Drug tests claim that they have a 99% efficiency rate, that sounds great but it still leaves room for error, which is something that cannot be allowed when it comes to American children's futures in the classroom or on the playing field. For example if the ten thousand tests that were issued out when testing first started, then 99% of these tests would have been valid but 1% or 100 people would have been incorrectly found guilty of using drugs. This may not seem like a whole lot but, for those one hundred kids and their families, that is a very serious deal. This could mean for seniors, a loss of academic or athletic scholarships, suspension or expulsion, and even legal consequences. Before something like drug testing can be implemented into society there must be a way to be one hundred percent clear on positive drug results. Because if the tests are not one hundred percent accurate then how can the falsely accused be protected? There are other things that can even further skew these results. For example some over the counter medicine such as Ibuprofen can cause, what is now by the medical world, a false positive. Other things such as poppy seeds can cause a false positive for opiates such as cocaine. These weaknesses in the testing process make it difficult for anyone to agree with testing high school students.
Lastly, most people who agree with drug testing in high schools agree with it because they believe that drug testing acts as a deterrent to drug use. The problem with that point is that it just flat out is not true. The Supreme Court has twice empowered schools to test for drugs, first among student athletes in 1995, then for those in other extracurricular activities last year. Both times, it cited the role that screening plays in combating substance abuse as a rationale for impinging on whatever privacy rights students might have. But the new federally financed study of 76,000 students nationwide, by far the largest to date, found that drug use is just as common in schools with testing as in those without it (Winter 1). Drug use in high school has actually declined slightly in the last two decades, not because of some drug-testing program that was implemented but because students are becoming more educated on the facts. It is pretty foolish to think that because someone who participates in extra-curricular activates might get tested he or she would stay away from the drugs. Because if someone is already addicted or hooked to the drugs the tests won't be a good enough preventative for them to stop. ''I don't think that drug testing works all the time, in all situations,'' Mr. Aultman said. ''And the truth is there were many kids who said, 'Yeah, we quit while we were in season and once the season was over we went back to using drugs' ''(Winter 2). This is also the scary reality of drug testing, the truth is it really doesn't do anything to stop drug use. It might make students quite for a certain amount of time, or just stop using before the tests are administered but it doesn't stop them from using drugs at all. It could even force kids into cheating on their tests, there are products out there that can ""fool"" drug tests by giving them false readings. If students were forced to do those sorts of things then that would be more detrimental to their social skills than drugs themselves.
Drug testing student athletes is not good for America for one it costs way too much money for too little results. It has been tried by some states but has failed, why keep trying to push something that isn't working. Why try and fix something that isn't broken. With the results from the few years of testing why doesn't the United States see that there really isn't a big problem with steroid use in high school? Hopefully in the future the U.S. can realize that steroids aren't affecting high school sports and after school activities like it is in the worlds of professional sports. These tests, if continued, would poison student's minds on issues such as freedom of privacy and freedom to avoid illegal searches and seizures. These tests cost too much first of all and in this economic time extra costs that are not beneficiary should not be allowed. Also these tests are not one hundred percent accurate, which allows for students to be falsely accused of using drugs and steroids. As well as the facts against steroid testing as being a deterrent to drug use. All in all drugs will be a part of high school's across America no matter what the government tries to do to stop it. Drug testing however, is not something the government should try to implement because of all the things that are faulty with drug testing.

"Is Death the most important theme in bringing out Meursault's personality in The Stranger by Albert Camus?
Brief Overview
Albert Camus has split the novel into two parts. The first part explores the death of Meursault's mother and Meursault's routine life. The second part explores Meursault's time spent in jail which I will discuss in more detail later in the essay.
The novel opens with Meursault receiving the terrible news of his mother's death. However, Meursault seems to be more concerned about the travel and transportation costs rather than the death itself. This is the first insight that readers get into his queer personality. During his mother's vigil, Meursault smokes and pays no attention to the funeral. The others at the funeral are repulsed and invigorated by his disrespectful behavior.
Meursault - the protagonist - had to send his mother off to an old-age home because he could not afford the time and the money to take care of her. He was a man that received average income and owned a very small apartment, barely enough to suit his needs, let alone his mother's. This act of sending his mother to an old-age home was deemed immoral by society.
The second significant event that is highlighted in part I of the novel, is Meursault's involvement with his neighbor - Raymond Sintes. Raymond and his girlfriend get into a feud involving domestic abuse. His girlfriend approaches the police for help while Raymond seeks help from Meursault. Raymond asks Meursault to help him write a letter to his girlfriend black mailing her to never contact him again. Soon after he sends the letter, the police shows up at his house and a huge scene is created.
Following this incident, Raymond invites Meursault to join him for a weekend getaway. Meursault agrees, and they go with a couple of friends to a beach house nearby. They realize that they are being stalked by Raymond's ex- girlfriend's brothers. However, nothing happens. The next day Meursault is in the beach, lounging around when he spots one of the brothers. He immediately reaches for the gun in his bag and shoots the brother.
Part II directly enters a scene in the courthouse. Meursault has been put in jail for murdering an Arab (the brother). The fact that the victim is Arab influences the story considerably because Arabs were treated badly at the time this novel was written. This also impacts the decision making process in the courthouse.
Meursault is too lazy to hire and seek his own attorney, so he sticks to the one appointed by the court. He explains his story, his origins and the event to the attorney. The attorney is perplexed by Meursault's ability to go on a vacation a week after his mother's death and his lack of grief towards the incident. Meursault questions the relevance of this lack of emotion towards the case in hand. Soon, the entire courthouse and the neighboring city hear about Meursault's stoic and callous nature. They are revolted and flabbergasted by his behavior. Ultimately, Meursault is hung to death, not for murdering an Arab, but for being the way that he is.
Reflective Background
Albert Camus was a philosophical writer who gained a lot of his inspiration from factors that influenced his life. Such influences are reflected throughout The Stranger.
The mood of pessimism was encouraged by political developments during the early 19th century. The world war caused much despair and woebegone. This gave birth to the theory of Absurdist which was largely advocated by Camus. Absurdist can essentially be defined as: The belief that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic world. It is one's responsibility to formulate a meaning in a meaningless life. Such an attitude is delineated through Meursault as his belief is to do or die and not to question why. Furthermore absurdist explains Meursaults insensitivity towards his mother's death, his superficial relationship with Marie and the murder of the Arab. Meursault's lack of meaning in life strongly contrasts his acceptance to live towards the end of the novel. This is can be viewed as Camus's portrayal of ""Absurdist"".
Camus and Meursault shared certain characteristics. For instance they both had a similar outlook towards life. They both were Pied Noirs who lived a substandard life. This can be inferred from the text as Meursault was unable to afford living with his mother, therefore he sent her to an old age home. He also lived in a small apartment which had 1 room. Camus's melancholic disposition towards the French is showcased through Meursault's reluctance to work in Paris.
Throughout The Stranger, Camus referred to Arabs simply by the word ""Arab"" instead of giving them a separate identity. The insignificance of the Arabs in the novel manifests itself as a form of discrimination. Moreover the minimal attention shown towards the Arab's death reemphasizes the fact that Arabs were not considered important. This discrimination was mirrored in Camus's environment where the Arabs were exploited harshly for their cheap labour by the French and were not given equal priority. The insight into the social background of Algeria during this time provides further insight of the discrimination in the novel.
Main Body
Loss and death are universal themes across literature, film, poetry etc. Authors use different methods and styles to highlight this theme, and add emotional depth to the reality portrayed in their works. Camus on the other hand, uses loss to highlight an unusual character's personality, in his work The Stranger. There are various instances of loss delineated in ""The Stranger"", primarily, the loss of Meursault's mother, the loss of the Arab, and the death of Meursault himself.
Meursault's reaction to his mother's death is unusual and alarming. He treats this fragile issue with immense nonchalance giving the impression of being a cold, distant and staid person. Meursault informs his manager that ""It's not my fault"" that he is missing work to attend his mother's funeral. This provides the readers with an idea that this funeral is merely an ""excuse"" and Meursault is obligated to attend it due to social customs. He may `also be defending the fact that he decided to send his mother to an old age home instead of taking personal care of her. We understand that he is not the type of person who likes to pin responsibility on others or accept blame himself.
Meursault smokes during the vigil without much hesitation. ""I thought it over, it really didn't matter "" . He believed that it was acceptable to smoke because his mother was dead and she couldn't possible protest against it. This highlights his inability to understand what is not only socially, but also morally correct. His emotional disconnect leads to his lack of respect for his mother, even on the day of her death.
Meursault recounted his weekend as something ""so inevitable and natural that I don't remember any of it any more"". His existentialist perspective of life is reflected in this quote. He views death as a natural and unavoidable phenomenon; he has no emotional value attached to the notion of death. ""After all, nothing had changed"" implies the fact that this loss did not impact his life significantly and he feels as though he has spent this weekend as he had spent any other weekend.
""I probably loved mother quite a lot, but that didn't mean anything"" is his justification for not crying or not showing any grief during his mother's funeral. He believes that love is not strong enough to propel a person to cry at a funeral or to display an array of emotions. He further claims, ""To a certain extent all normal people sometimes wished their loved ones were dead."". Despite the shocking things he says, we understand that he is a candid and honest man, with nothing to hide. His life is an open book. He does not feel the need to comply with societal norms or behave in a socially accepted manner. This unique and somewhat rebellious personality distinguishes him from the other members of society. However, it is this laid-back attitude that ultimately leads him to his own demise.
Meursault's reaction to the Arab's murder is extremely indifferent and difficult to comprehend as a reader. . ""I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times."" He is more concerned about ruining a perfectly happy and peaceful day rather than killing a man. This makes Meursault appear selfish as his happiness is his main priority and there is no limit to what he will do to achieve it. He shot the Arab four more times, as the wrath of the sun was beating down upon him instilling anger in him. He took out the anger on the Arab for further irritating him. Physical aspects of life dominate the emotional aspects of life. Death is a very absurdist concept as although, we as human beings understand that death is ultimately inevitable, we still fear death and its consequences. Yet when death does occur, we are emotionally overwhelmed and unable to come to terms with it.
The sun is a metaphor for society in the novel. Just as the heat of the sun makes Meursault uncomfortable, so does the expectations of society. Society is unable to cope with Meursault's ""existentialist"" perspective of life. The existentialist perspective emphasizes on the idea that there is no Supreme Power influencing the sequences of actions that takes place on the Earth. Every event that happens is a result of the actions of an individual. Meursault accepts the fact that everything happens for a reason whether it is good or bad. The control of certain things in life is beyond the realms of human control. Hence, he readily accepts his mother's death and the loss of the Arab.
All living things eventually decease sooner or later. However, the sun will continue to engulf the earth in its vicious wrath of heat. The burning rays of the sun will never come to an end as far as our knowledge goes. Hence, the sun is a more powerful concept than death, therefore the sun affects Meursault more than the prospect of death. The heat of the sun drives Meursault to kill the Arab due to frustration and annoyance. He believes that ""what's done is done"". In Meursault's own words, ""it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness"". To him, death is the barrier to freedom, as no matter how a person lives, whether a person leads a happy like, an unhappy life, an honest life, an unfulfilling life, in the end, the person will die. Hence the journey of life itself is pointless as all people end up travelling to the same destination which is death. ""The inescapability of death voids the very possibility of 'ultimate' or metaphysical freedom."" Actions cannot be reversed, thus there is no point dwelling over what cannot be changed. This attitude may be helpful when it comes to petty, insignificant issues but not when it deals with death.
When it comes to his very own death, Meursault accepts his death and execution despite the fact that he is being sentenced to death for his indifferent attitude rather than committing a heinous crime of murdering an Arab for no reason at all. By not trying to redeem himself and his behavior in front of everyone in the court, Meursault is not only committing ordinary suicide but is also committing philosophical suicide. In order for Meursault to resume a peaceful and fairly normal life like he used to, he must completely transform himself and reinvent his personality to meet the societal requirements. By reinventing himself, Meursault is essentially destroying himself by transforming into a completely different person altogether. Either way, the true ""him"" is being disguised or murdered. ""Is one going to die, escape by the leap, and rebuild a mansion of ideas and forms to one's own scale? Is one, on the contrary, going to take up the heart-rending and marvelous wager of the absurd?"" Meursault objects to living a meaningless, unfulfilling life under the heavy scrutiny of society. He'd much rather die than live a life dictated by someone else.
In conclusion, several aspects of Meursault's personality have been revealed throughout the novel. The most prominent personality traits are his indifferent attitude towards emotional events, his absurdist and existential outlook on life. Death is an extremely significant theme in the novel that contributes heavily toward the understanding of Meursault's character. However in the end, the metaphorical and physical death of Meursault reflects society's inability to be accepting towards different kinds of people. Not only Meursault, but essentially the stranger has been wiped out from society. Society can now live peacefully with the fact that there is no longer an anomaly dwelling amongst them. This tragic death of Meursault represents society's victory.

"In modern world, people living in this planet are becoming closer than ever before. Product and liquid capital that generate in a state will be transfer in the others. International trade and communication seems not uncommon anymore. This phenomenon affects the economic business and exerts a wide influence on society. To describe such a phenomenon, economist use the term ""Globalization"". Also, economist consider that the core sense of globalization is economic. ""Academically, globalization is most closely associated with the term economic globalization: the integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, foreign direct investment, capital flows, migration, the spread of technology, and military presence"" (Bhagwati, Jagdish).
Source: http://www.helium.com
With the concept of globalization appears and brings out effect on our world like that, a issue regarding it has been arise; is globalization good or bad? There are two viewpoint about the effect of globalization. One group, the anti-globalization, argue that globalization will cause unemployment and have bad affect on local market; the other group, the globalization supporters, attribute economic growth to globalization. As the picture above shows, the result of election regarding whether globalization is good or bad was almost a tie. It seem that globalization is not a simple matter. In my point of view, globalization is a unstoppable trend that have advantages exceeding its disadvantages.
Anti-globalization claim that globalization is creating firm closures and high unemployment rate. As history shows, firm closure's number is continued increasing while globalization is speeding up. One of the biggest disadvantages of globalization is outsourcing, while it provides jobs to a population in one country, takes away those jobs from another country, leaving many without opportunities. ""A Zogby International poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that ""outsourcing jobs overseas"" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource"" (Zogby).
Moreover, under the construction of globalization, unemployment is prevailing at very high rates, which cause constant fear of losing because of the competition is more intense than before. ""During a period of globalization, some firms still perform better than others. Those high performing ones can often squeeze weaker performing ones out of the marketplace, causing firm closures"" (Moffatt). Therefore, Huge firm closures have occur in worldwide, causing millions of worker lose their job. ""1995 was the beginning of a period of exceptional growth. However, almost 500,000 firms closed shop. The year 2001 saw almost no growth in the economy, but we only had 14% more business closures than in 1995 and fewer businesses filed for bankruptcy in 2001 than 1995"" (Moffatt).
As a result, competition enhance technologies improvement, saving labour cost while raising a higher unemployment rate. ""Survival in the new global business market calls for improved productivity and increased competition. Due to the market becoming worldwide, companies in various industries have to upgrade their products and use technology skilfully in order to face increased competition"" (Anthro). In fact, a large number of workers become unemployed, especially in manufacturing industry. ""Due to increased globalization, lack of education, health care prices, and the automobile industry, the unemployment rate has risen to a steady 6.7% in Michigan alone"" (Nadeem). It seems that globalize economic has indirectly contribute to the technological improvement, but on the other hand, it also spell disaster for workers who work for manufacture industry.
In addition, there are no doubt that some other side effects will also occur. Mike Collins, a economic journalist once said: ""As manufacturing continues to decline, so does our ability to innovate. In the long term this means fewer well paid jobs, lower productivity, declining wages, declining living standards and low economic growth."" The point being make is that chain reaction will happen to the world's economic while the trend of globalization is becoming stronger.
The anti-globalists also argue that globalization is not working for the majority of the world. The general complaint about globalization is that it has made the rich richer while making the non-rich poorer. It is wonderful for managers and investors, but hell on workers and nature. ""During the most recent period of rapid growth in global trade and investment, 1960 to 1998, inequality worsened both internationally and within countries. The UN Development Program reports that the richest 20 percent of the world's population consume 86 percent of the world's resources while the poorest 80 percent consume just 14 percent"" (Longworth). Polarization among global seems obvious and will keep on develop as the world's economic is becoming tighten. Apparently, the hard burden of easying such an intense situation will fall on those so-called multilateral organisations like the IMF, World Bank and World Trade Organization.
However, according to anti-global activists, the WTO is not a democratic institution, because their rules are written by and for corporations with inside access to the negotiations. ""Citizen input by consumer, environmental, human rights and labor organizations is consistently ignored."" (Della Porta). It truth that WTO cannot be fair to everyone especially when it comes to a country's sovereignty. ""I don't remember electing them, so what gives them the right to say how countries run their own affairs? Isn't it obvious that these organisations only serve the interests of the US and to a lesser extent the other rich countries? Their only role is to peddle the neoliberal orthodoxy that only maximises the profits of multination"" (Williamson). Since mutilation organization cannot make a difference about polarization between rich and poor under the force of globalization, the distribution of benefit has lost its balance.
The universal benefits can't be achieved with globalization because the rich are getting richer and poor are becoming poorer. Therefore, large protest against globalization was urged by anti-globalizations. For example, ""at the end of November 1999, Seattle saw major governments meet at a WTO ministerial meeting to discuss various trading rules. Enormous public protests ensued. It resulted in a WTO failure to agree on many issues, without adopting any resolutions"" (Shah).

Globalization did not help the world's poverty. Instead of being an unstoppable force for development, globalisation has make the world's economic become unbalance, which only deliver rich to few people. As the picture above shows, unrestricted free trade benefits those with more financial leverage at the expense of the poor. ""Although global average per capita income rose strongly throughout the 20th century, the income gap between rich and poor countries has been widening for many decades"" (Sutherlan). Evidences shows that globalization has not worked.
On the other side, supporters of globalization believe that Globalization's effects have been overwhelmingly good. On account of globalization, the trade fort's is being eliminated, by which company can produce at less cost and selling in a hihger demanding market. Hence, more money generated in the economy, bring prosperity to all.
Guided by unprecedented liberalization, world trade continues to expand faster than overall global economic output. ""Emergence of worldwide production markets and broader access to a range of foreign products for consumers and companies. Particularly movement of material and goods between and within national boundaries. International trade in manufactured goods increased more than 100 times (from $95 billion to $12 trillion) in the 50 years since 1955. China's trade with Africa rose sevenfold during 2000-07 alone"" (Fotopoulos). With free trade, the products are free to move between different countries, making consumer the true winner in globalization because they can buy the best products from the global free market.
Furthermore, as more money is poured in to developing countries, there is a greater chance for the people in those countries to economically succeed and increase their standard of living. The collaboration among the countries of the entire world has been made stronger with globalization, now countries can easily move to the markets at which they are better. ""Developing countries are able to reap the benefits of current technology without undergoing many of the growing pains associated with development of these technologies"" (Williamson). As a result, there are lower prices, more employment and a better standard of life in these developing nations.
Take China for example. Globalization significantly led to higher incomes is in China over the past several decades. ""They have mastered the concept of globalization in their own way far from the Western norms. In an article by Dani Rodrik China has averaged almost 8 percent per annum per capita by opening up to the world economy. By taking part in globalization China has been able to fund modernization by selling its products on the world market"" (Nadeem). What is more, in the 1990s alone, foreign investors have poured $1 trillion into developing Chinese economies. This trade and investment is raising living standards faster than many people could thought possible. From the picture below we can see that the purchasing power, or living standards in China have double every 10 years. These evidence prove that with a strategy most fit to a country, globalization can be achieved successfully.
In contrary to anti-globalization, the fact shows that globalization bring job opportunity and welfare to poor region, which crate a better living environment. ""Liberals look at globalization as an efficient tool to eliminate penury and allow the poor people a firm foothold in the global economy. In two decades from 1981 to 2001, the number of people surviving on $1 or less per day decreased from 1. 5 billion to 1. 1 billion. Simultaneously, the world population also increased. Thus, the percentage of such people decreased from 40% to 20% in such developing countries"" (Burande). Besides, by using a country's comparative advantage, or what they can produce at a lower opportunity cost than other countries, they can get all the benefits of trade. If every country has a comparative advantage that means that everyone can gain from trade. ""There is remarkable evidence that globalization is helping countries expand and achieve higher incomes or a higher GDP. Research was conducted on national incomes around the world during the 1990s and results showed that the income of rich globalized countries increased by 2% each year. The results also show that poor, more globalized countries have a higher increase in income per year than poor, less globalized countries"" (Burande). It's clear that global trade can stimulate a nation's economic according to the comparative advantage theory. Also, the third world country can take advantage from globalized economy rather than just being a victim in our globalize world.
Globalization is a slow process, but it is working. People who are anti-globalization, in my opinion, are merely fail to see the prosperity that globalization brings. Besides, a country closed to the rest of the world will not learn to better themselves, and continue to do things they way they have been doing. Here is an example. During the Qing dynasty, China became the world's largest economy. They also expanded their empire, gaining much more territory. However, when the country began to close itself off from the rest of the world, the country produced only 9% of the worlds gross domestic product in early 1900s, while she produced 33% in the early 1800s. Much of this is due to the fact that the industrial revolutions of Europe and America, events that the Chinese did not participate in, caused them to fall behind (China). As history shows, there will not be much room for improvements and new opportunities to countries that do participate in globalization.
In the end, even though globalization brings some bad effect to the world such as unemployment, it still doing good in the big picture. With the free trade, globalization creates a level playing field for all world economies. As globalization opens more opportunities, it will bring more diversity and thus creating world peace and prosperity and make the world a better place to live. To me, globalization is a unstoppable trend that have advantages exceeding its disadvantages. There fore, we should support it.

Korean Military System: Innovation or maintenance 
Claim/Argument: Current Korean military system requires too much of painstaking efforts from the soldiers. They surly deserve better and the basic problems are the policy and the general perspective from the non-soldiers. The way to solve the issue is to enhance the benefits of the soldiers and change the general view towards the military. 
I. Since the Korean War, people think that the military should always be harsh and strict. 
a. Harsh and demanding nature of the army often stresses out the soldiers. 
b. KATUSA, which is the U.S. army based in the South Korea is known for the free and non-harsh nature of it. This U.S. army is very popular in South Korea and always so crowded from the people who want to go there. This proves how people eagerly want to escape from the harsh nature of South Korean army. 
II. The current policies for the South Korea army are pressuring the South Korean soldiers. 
a. The recent policies make the soldiers to pay to do their laundries, buy cigarettes, etc. 
b. Many female students are also claiming that the soldiers deserve better than current situations. 
III. South Korea is depending too much of their military parts on the United States. 
a. In fact, the United States is responsible of more of the finance situations than South Korea is. 
b. United States' citizens are worrying about giving out too much of their secret information to South Korea. 
c. Moreover, United States is causing more of the cultural and diplomatic issues in South Korea. Some of the South Korean politicians and citizens are worrying about the further problems. 
d. The reason the United States army has been in South Korea is to give the full autonomy to South Korean army. (Lee) 
i. Now is the time to give the actual complete independence to South Korea army. Or else, South Korea would be too used to receiving the assistance and will not be independent after all. 
IV. Although the Korean army should not be abolished at all, the current policies could be replaced with the better. 
a. The total suicide rate in South Korea is increasing, and that of soldiers is also increasing. 
b. In reality, South Korea is being threatened more of the inside issue in military: Suicide and murder, not actually of North Korea. (Kirk) 
i. This is a heads-up issue because the trend of the rate is increasing. 
ii. Sexual torture, physical torture, 21 months of time spent and then school again are pressuring the new soldiers. 
V. The benefits for the soldiers are too little. 
a. United States support their veterans in various ways: Support their education, buying houses, etc. (Richards, interview) 
i. South Korea should really consider increasing their benefits for their soldiers. 
ii. Too much of soldiers are complaining about their current situations. 
iii. Without further benefits, South Korea would never have a positive view towards their army. 
b. The salary itself is also a big issue for the current soldiers. 
i. The average wage the soldiers get per month is about 150 dollars. Surprisingly, this amount is 3.8% increased amount compared to the previous year.

The feasibility of electric vehicle's use in China 
An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. The development of the electric vehicles has started in the 19th century, but the topic about use of electric vehicles just become hot and popular recently because the environment nowadays especially in China begins to be worse and worse and all the people realize that they should come up with some solution to handle it. Facing this topic, some critics support to continue to use motor vehicles and state that it is not necessary for people in China to start to use electric vehicles to enhance the society because of its immature development. However, in my opinion, the use of the electric vehicles in China is exactly expectant and feasible. And the reasons which can totally support my opinion will be separately listed as follows. 
First and foremost, electric vehicles can efficiently save non-renewable energy resource because electric vehicle only use electric as energy to move, which means that this kind of vehicles do not need to use gasoline any more. It is all known that gasoline is refined by petroleum and almost machines nowadays depend on petroleum. With the development of the technology in China, most of Chinese become richer and are able to afford a motor vehicle. In this case, the demand of motor vehicles achieved are being achieved rapidly. Actually, the number of motor vehicles maintains capacity of 1. 92 billion. Obviously, as a country which has the most population in the world, China's cost of petroleum is extremely huge. So, with the occurrence of the electric vehicles, the problem of rare non-renewable energy resource in China can reasonable improved. Assuming that, when almost Chinese try to use electric vehicles, the use of petroleum will be absolutely decreased. The government can save a lot of rare energy resource to develop some other new projects. However, some people states that motor vehicle is still better because the gasoline can make it have more impetus than battery. To this point, there is an explicit statement given by Professor Hua Cai who is an assistant professor in the school of industrial engineering at Purdue University. Professor Cai states that nowadays the companies in China which produce the electric vehicles also notice this problem, so they are also develop some new kind of battery to make sure the motivation of electric vehicles equal that of gasoline vehicles. In this situation, those people's worries will rapidly solved in the future. Therefore, the use of battery vehicles seem to be necessary because of saving the rare non-renewable energy resource. 
Moreover, the use of the electric for vehicles can widely reduce the exhaust of pollution. Each gasoline car produce a lot of emission to which can easily cause air pollution. In today's China, the problem of air pollution is extremely serious, the sky in all the Chinese cities are always grey. In other words, people even cannot see the really blue sky day by day. The research from the Chinese environmental protection administration states the nowadays the pollution from the motor vehicles gradually becomes the most important reason to cause the haze in China. The principal of this research claims that the emission from the motor vehicles seriously influences people's health and environment and the government begins to limit the demand of the gasoline vehicles. In this case, because of using battery, the electric vehicles can easily develop this problem. A paper which named ""Research on Development Electric Vehicles in China"" points out that the electric vehicles do not discharge any exhaust which is harmful to the environment and people's health. It seems that using electric vehicle to replace the motor vehicle is a benign way to enhance the environment, but some critic points out it is not convenient for all the people to use battery cars because there is a little battery station nowadays. To this problem, if someone carefully do some research on the development of the electric vehicles, he or she will find that more and more local government in China gradually begin to generalize the use of electric vehicle such as using it as taxi and plan to build to more battery station. So, this worry can immediately handle by the promotion of the government. As a result, no emission is also an essential reason for the use of the electric vehicles. 
Finally, although some people may points out that the cost of electric vehicles is a little expensive and they worry that almost Chinese are not willing to pay for it, the electric vehicles can continuously help people save their money because of the cheap cost of the battery. It is known that all the people should use gasoline to refuel their motor vehicles, as I mentioned above, gasoline is becomes less and less recently, which means that the sale of it will gradually increase. In this situation, when a person buy a motor vehicle in a low price compare to the electric vehicle, they will spend lots of money on feeding their motor vehicles. However, to the electric vehicles, it can be easily charged by electric. As a clean energy, electric is exactly easier to get, so the cost of people to charge their vehicles is totally cheaper than that of gasoline vehicles. In other words, people will exactly save their money if they choose to use electric vehicles but not gasoline vehicles in a long period. 
In short, through the above reasons, we can clearly know almost advantages brought form the electric vehicles. The electric vehicles can not only save the rare energy resource but also efficient develop and enhance the China's environment. So, promoting the use of the electric vehicles seems to be feasible and necessary. And all the worries from some people to the battery vehicles can also be solved by different kinds of solutions. At now, not just in China, most of countries have tried to use the electric vehicles. The development in the future of the electric vehicles will be brighter and better with the more experiments.

"The Chinese student adaption to America life 
With the development of Chinese economics, an increasing number of Chinese international students appear in American universities. However, coming to America does not represent a student can live a qualified life and study well in America. Actually most Chinese international students have the difficulty of adapting to American life. In this case, for the better adaptation, Chinese international students need to make great efforts for instance jumping out of the comport zone and finding a appropriate job. 
The fact that most Chinese students cannot Adapt to the America life does exsist due to two main reasons below. Firstly, Chinese culture leads to the characteristic of students to be shy and face-saving. They always reject to talk to strangers. Secondly, the weakness in English aggravates the situation. Chinese English teaching model results in the poor vocabulary and the influenced oral speaking skill of Chinese international students. With these issues, they are afraid of talking to American native classmates because they probably made mistakes in talking. Adaptation to America lifestyle is really a big challenge and this problem is severe because its negative effects. A research did by a yale university study group showed the result that among 130 Chinese international students who have been surveyed, 45% of students had depression symptoms and 29% of them are related to anxiety symptoms (). In the long term, the lasting depression and anxiety could cause the mental illness, which means the difficulty in adaption could impact the psychological development of teenagers who study in America and even make the irreversible influence to their whole life. 
In light of the current situation of Chinese international students, great efforts and large progress are needed. A better way to shorten the time international students need to adapt to America life is working on campus. Working on campus provides international students a great chance to communicate with other native speaker because their colleges are likely American students. What's more, working can help international students better understand the American way of thinking and working. In working, sometimes Chinese students are pushed to socialize and actively participate in the host culture. The research shows the less degree of depression when a student has more contact and communication with Americans around you because when you talk to them and try to understand them, the unfamiliar people becomes friendly and the unfamiliar environment becomes familiar. 
However a small part of people owning the opposite view that it's unnecessary for Chinese international students to worry so much and make large efforts. They consider Chinese students can only play and work with Chinese students and they can form a group that every Chinese feel comfortable in this zone. Actually it is an unrealistic idea because a Chinese student can never avoiding contact to Americans even though there are thousands of Chinese around him or her. Their professor is a American, the group mates distributed by TA are Americans, drivers of school bus and even the sellers of a bookstore are Americans. In u.s, American guys are the main steam and communication and interaction with them are parts of life. a person who stay in the comfort zone cannot make progress and get success. The time a person feel difficult and challenged is also the time a person can learn and grow. Also some people consider doing a part time job can influence the study. Actually, many students get a good grade while working on campus. As long as you schedule your time reasonably, there is no confliction between studying and a part time job. 
The problem that most Chinese international students cannot adapt to America life does exist and cannot be ignored. Further, Chinese international students can better accommodate in American environment when there is more communication and interaction between international students and domestic students. The final goal for international students is blend in the native life and society, which cannot success without several years of efforts. Every Chinese international student must experience this challenge and change if he or she wants to stay in America and live well. So a lot of works still need to be done for them.

"P5D3 Argumentative Essay 
April 26th, 2015 
The Electronic Books Should be Promoted in Campus 
With the process of technology development, people can easily read text though their laptop and tablet. Electronic book, an evolutionary idea from about ten years ago, have become feasible, creating a probability that carrying over thousands books in pocket. Thus, universities should consider to promote electronic textbooks, for student's convenience. Electronic books do not only help students to reduce the cost on textbooks and weight on their shoulders but also enhance study efficiency. Thus, promoting electronic books for university students is necessary. 
First of all, electronic books release time and financial pressure. As a full-time student in college, tuition and resident fee are not the only thing one needs to consider about. The reason of the consideration is that students also need to purchase the text book and other materials for the subjects they study. As a result, students need to spend about 1,200 dollars every year for a semester college education (The College Board, 2015). As far as I am concerned, I spent five hundred dollars on textbooks for last semester's course. A thousand dollars are much less than tuition fee but the purchase of books does increase the cost of college education and make the financial situation worse for the students who have educational loan. US News indicates that seventy percent of 2013 graduates have already left twenty eight thousand dollars loan debt before taking jobs (Bidwell, 2014). Moreover, textbooks priced in hundreds dollars would become worthless after finishing courses unless students sell to other who need it, which can be a serious waste of both time and money. Even though renting or buying used books for discounted price is an option, there is still a possibility that the supply of the used book is not able to satisfy the demand of it. Comparatively, without the concern of material and printing, electronic textbooks take an advantage in both price and supply. 
Without the money on paper and shipment, electronic books are supposed to have lower prices. Unfortunately, several market facts influence the price of electronic books and they are sold with a little discount. For example, textbook Thomas' Calculus usually sold for two hundred and fifty dollars in print and one hundred and ninety dollars in electronic. So, some people argue that electronic books actually do not save money as much as they expected. However, universities take their responsibility by promoting electronic books projects. Purdue University is one of the first universities which shows its interest on electronic textbooks and Purdue recently has a trial project about electronic books called the e Text Pilot. The e Text Pilots sells electronic textbooks for twenty dollars for some courses and provides assistance to certain instructors and courses that advocate the use of electronic books (<name>, personal communication, 13 March 2015). Therefore, universities' efforts on electronic reading projects accelerate the arrival of electronic books to campus. 
Except the advantage on price, light electronic readers are becoming popular among young people. Since a typical textbook often weights in several pounds, many students complain they are tired of taking a heavy bag which is full of books. In fact, they only need to read a few material every class, which means they waste their energy on carrying useless papers all the day. Additionally, paper books also need lots of space for storage, usually bookshelves or boxes. Although some have suggested to separate cumbersome books in parts to sell, it forces people to buy a large number of books and causes troubles on organizing. Therefore, an electronic reading devices can be the best solution. Light and diminutive as a magazine, a reading devices usually is able to store overs thousand books in TXT format or hundreds in PDF format (as... format in. devices). People can put their devices in wherever they want-backpacks, pockets or handbags. Not only certain reading devices, people still can also read from their tablet, laptop or even cellphones. In addition, thanks to the emerging display technology, some devices have the feature that text on the screen seems to like reading paper books. Thank to developing reading devices, electronic books are attracting more and more people. 
However, creating portability, reading devices give people convenience with concerns because using electronic devices could make students distract from class when they pay their attention on tapping and scrolling, let alone reading other unrelated books on class. For an instructor, it is impossible to keep eyes on every student while teaching. Therefore, using such reading devices could reduce students' performance. I admit that students cannot always totally focus on class, but no one read textbooks during the class. Most of their behavior is listening to instructor, taking notes and trying to understand the class content. Normally, instructors have already asked students to finish reading tasks before class and it is unnecessary to read during class. Thus, using devices undoubtedly has negative influences to learning efficiency on class. It still cannot be blamed as the main reason of sidetracking from class. 
Contrary to some people's concerns about whether electronic books distract students, electronic books shows some functions that never happen on paper books. Reading books is not the only thing can do. During reading, student use build-in dictionary, encyclopedia and online research to help them learn immediately. Researchers from Technologico de Monterrey in Mexico find that electronic readers like Kindle help students, especially who are good are using digital devices, to have an improvement on study. Some instructors who support electronic books are trying to revise their teach methodology and provide students with extra learning content like the access to some videos, lecture notes and online exercise (Martinez-Estrada, et al, 2012). 
Nowadays, some people have expressed their will for replacing the heavy and expensive textbooks. Since there are increasing number of people start noticing the change of books, the use of electronic books will popularize rapidly and shock the traditional textbooks market in the recent future. Electronic books do show the potential of not only a way to save cost and energy but also a revolution of learning habits and teaching methodology to college education.

"Does physical activities affect academia positively? 
Nowadays, Sports seem as an indivisible part in daily life. It is well known that it provides huge amount of benefits to human being. However, some people argue that doing physical activities such as sports will weaken academic performance. They think the time commitment is difficult to achieve for the sport player at school, because they have to spend several hours in practice, team meeting, traveling to compete, which takes a lot of time away from studies. For instance, parents in China always dissent from their children participating in sports during school, especially before the exams. They are certain that sports will decrease their children's grades. This belief prevents my friend from participating in sports and makes him feel frustrated. In my opinion, I believe physical activities have positive effects on academic performance, so I did some online research and collected some data from interviewing a sports expert. The results show that physical activities do boost students' academic performance. 
Physical activities mean any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. It can be defined in two parts, regular moderate intensity physical activity and vigorous intensity physical activity. Moderate intensity physical activities include walking, cycling, or participating in sports. Vigorous physical activities have a higher activity level than moderate. Adequate level of physical activities can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and coronary heart disease and breast cancer, and it can improve bone and functional health and keep weight control. (World Health Organization, 2014) 
Moreover, physical activities can affect brain function. According to an article name physical exercise for brain health, ""It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones, all of which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth of brain cells."" (brain HQ, 2014) Moreover, a study from the Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia indicates that exercise for twenty minutes can promote information processing and memory function. (brain HQ, 2014) In addition, sports can promote brain cell repair, improve memory, lengthen attention span, strengthen decision-making skills, and improve multi-tasking and planning. (Rachel J., 2014) As you can see the brain benefits of physical activities, they also can be related to academic performance. For example, lengthen attention span can help us be more concentrated in class, good memory can help us absorb knowledge better and multi-tasking can help with time management in study. Overall, the brain benefits of physical activities could boost academic performance. 
To support my opinion, I found out three research results related to the academic performance and physical activities. According the research on children's intelligence, cognition and academic achievement and based on the structure of the human brain, it shows that physical exercise can make people become smarter, because the regular aerobic activity leads to changes in brain associated with improved cognition. More biologically, Fisk, J said that, "" physical activity also floods the body with certain mood-enhancing chemicals that might make learning more enjoyable. Exercise can also improve your child's self-image and might help mitigate the effects of social and academic stress."" (Fisk, J, 2014). 
Secondly, an article published by University of Miami indicated that sports have positive effect on students in 1998. According to the preliminary result of an ongoing national study, it found that middle and high school students who participate in sports are more likely to graduate from high school than the students who don't like playing sports. Based on this phenomenon, Jomills Braddock, director of university of Miami Sports analyzed the benefits of participating in sports, he said, ""Sports require teamwork in the pursuit of mutual goals to achieve success. With sports, young people learn to recognize and value the unique and important contributions of their diverse teammates."" Moreover, he also used his students as an example. He collected the data about students taking AP (Advanced Placement) courses and personal study plans. And he found out that African American student athletes are more likely plan to attend colleges, take AP courses and enrolled in college prep program than the non student-athletes. This result reinforces that participating in sports can boost academic performance. At last, Braddock (1998) concluded that participating in sports could enhance student's academic aspiration, investments and achievements. 
Lastly, another article written by Thomas Cornelissen and Christian Pfeifer analyses the impact of participation in sports during childhood and adolescence on educational attainment. According to Thomas Corneliben, leisure activities can have positive effects on educational productivity. For instance, healthier athletes could increase the productivity and invest more to human capital as they can live longer. Secondly, sports can help ones to learn leadership, teamwork, and socialization and become well organized and perform better in academia. Last but not least, ""sport can help to form the character of young people because it teaches behavioral habits like motivation, discipline, tenacity, competitive spirit, responsibility, perseverance, confidence, and self-esteem, which cannot always be acquired in classroom."" (Thomas Corneliben, 2007, page 4). In brief, all of these positive effects of sports induce that one perform better in academia. 
Besides, according to my interviewee, Tricia Tort, the associated director of the fitness center. She studied kinesiology and health exercises classes for undergraduate, and then she went to graduate school for health administration. She oversees the entire fitness program such as group exercises classes, personal training. Tricia said exercise help with the sleep pattern that can help students perform better in academic. Furthermore, she suggested the regular exercise should be 30 to 60 minutes on four or five days a week. And she indicated that students who usually come to Co Rec have higher grades and they earn more academic credits than those who don't come here often. This data also supports that physical activities improve academic performance. 
In conclusion, the online research and the interview that I have done strongly proves my statement that physical activities can boost academic performance. I think this result will be a perfect direction for the university students, because students can earn better grades with less stress. Although this project helps me understand the connection between physical activities and academic performance better, I still need to do more research and experiments to prove it.

Food in dining court: the reason of obesity? 
An old Chinese saying, ""Hunger breeds discontentment"", perfectly illustrates the importance of food-only when people are not hungry can they live, study and work well. However, people nowadays are focusing on something beyond-they are controlling their health condition and are preferring healthy diet. During the time when I was having my meal in the dining court, I found that some people were apparently suffered from obesity. Then a question came into my mind: does the food in the dining court lead to the obesity? Healthy food contains two aspects. First, it should be fresh and clean. Dirty or decomposed food will definitely do harm to our health. Second, it should be healthy to eat. After doing a set of research, I am holding the view that the dining court in Purdue serves healthy food. 
The sources of food ingredients are reliable. According to Lisa Garcia, the supervisor of Ford dining court who has been working there for seven years, the majority of frozen meat, bread and milk come from food stores at Purdue, Piazza Produce and Dean's. In order to keep the food ingredients fresh and clean, all fruit and vegetables are local food. Some of them even come from the student farm at Purdue. 
The menu is designed by trained people. The dining court hires chef and system dining court manager to build the menus. They know that people nowadays are more health conscious and they designed healthy menus. For adults, a healthy diet should contain food, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. (WHO, 2015). Vegetables and fruits are adequate. Bananas, apples and oranges are served in the dining court every day. Lettuce, spinach, carrots and green beans can be found and people can make their own vegetable salad in the dining court. Rice and bread are also unlimited. In a word, the dining court serves several kinds of food that are supposed to be in a healthy diet. If you look at the everyday menu, you will discover that these healthy food are the majority. 
However, some people might disagree with my opinion. Indeed, the dining court also serve fries, pulled pork slider and other fried food. But they are not the main reason that lead to obesity at Purdue. First, what you choose to eat does matter. The dining court offers buffet, which means that no one is forcing you to eat unhealthy food. One example is the beverage. According to Lisa Garcia, even though there are more than ten types of soft beverages being offered in the dining court, the most popular drink is the water. Students do know that drinking water is much healthier. People should learn how to contain the energy they intake every day. According to the suggestion by WHO, adults should intake less than 10% of total energy from free sugars and approximately 2000 calories per day. (WHO, 2015) The dining court does a great job in guiding people to eat healthier. All the calories content for food are labeled. Third, unhealthy food is not the only reason of obesity. Western societies display an increased tendency toward sedentary lifestyle. (Vilchis-Gil, 2015, p.2). Not taking enough exercises is also the reason of obesity. 
In conclusion, the dining court at Purdue serves enough healthy food. Although it also provides some unhealthy food, people should choose to eat. Only good eating habits and enough exercises can keep you away from obesity.

"P5D1 Argument 
4/14/15 
Argument for artificial flavor 
	Artificial flavors are everywhere. Most of the packaged food contain artificial flavors to gain back the loss of taste due to all kinds of food processing. But is it really necessary to add artificial flavors? I think we should find new ways in food processing in order to keep the natural flavor in the food other than adding flavors to the food to gain back the lost. Because using better food processing technique make more enjoyable and natural taste. Also, artificial flavors are bad for our health and our environment. Addition of artificial flavors are not beneficial in long term. 
	Even though people might say artificial flavors give our food so many wonderful taste and it's pretty safe because only very few case in the food safety problem are reasoned by artificial flavors' usage. And the amount of artificial flavors are so small that no one will get sick. But they are just having a one-side view. 
	Artificial flavors are giving us a potential risk in our body and our environment. Artificial flavors are the mixture of chemicals that give us the specific tastes but most of the chemicals that we take in as flavors give us potential risks because our ancestor didn't naturally have them in our diet. Artificial flavor had just been developed within 50 years. According to Schreiber K, most of the artificial sweeteners are harmful for us. They will cause not only obesity like real sugars but will also cause an increasing heart rate and blood pleasure when absorbed by our body. According to a long term study artificial flavors can even gave us potential risk of easily getting cancer. So artificial flavors are surely harming our health no matter how little the amount is. 
Artificial flavors are also harming our environment too. Depending on what chemical is produced, there will be harmful waste produced in this process. For some esters they need fluorine in the producing process. As we know, fluorine is dangerous when release in the air, it will damage the ozone sphere. According to Dr. Xu Q, a professor working in Purdue, the changes made by artificial flavors are serious. The production of artificial flavors just like all kinds of chemical factories are harming our environment, and artificial flavors themselves are slowly changing our diet. We eat more colorful and tastier food than before. But the nutrition of the food were decreasing because the food with less nutrition usually add more artificial flavors to make them taste better. Dr. Xu Q believes that the most serious problems related to the produce and usage of artificial flavor is allergies. Human don't used to be allergic to food like milk and nuts. But the changing in our diet and environment surely changed our body and there are an increasing number of people who get allergic to something. 
We can't just stop using artificial flavors because they are cheap and taste stronger than natural food but artificial flavors are so harmful that we should reduce using them. We need to find new ways to entertain our tough other than artificial flavors. 
Artificial flavors are for gain back the lost on the food processing and make new taste of the food. So why not we keep the original flavors in the food and there's no need to add flavor any more. More and higher technique storage systems had been invented to provide any flavor and nutrition lost. Now, companies are releasing more and more new refrigerator that can reduce the lost due to the storage. New cooking system may also heat the food in a more suitable ways to prevent the flavor from losing. This is more beneficial than just adding artificial flavors because using better storing and cooking system will gave us not only a better taste but also a meal that contain lots of nutrition. Everyone wants there food to be tasty. Instead of harmed by artificial flavors when consuming tasty food, better food processing gives us new ways in eat tasty as well as eat healthy. 
Artificial flavors with its own benefit of stronger taste, easy to produce and stable is now a huge industrial in the food system. But we should limit for artificial flavors because all its dangerous potential risks. Better food process condition is one of the way to let food taste better and healthier without using artificial flavor. No one want to get in to trouble just because eating food. Finding new process to get better taste are more important than just adding artificial flavor.

"Geiger, Mexican Drug War
Mexican Drug War
Ken Geiger
Kacie Beagen
26 April 2009
The Mexican Dug War is a problem that has been brewing since the 1980's and has now began to turn heads. The war started as a simple transport of drugs from Mexico to the United States but now it has become violent. The Drug Cartels in Mexico are now operating in the United States and are using the money made in the drug trade to transport guns and other weapons across the border to Mexico. This war has spun out of control. The illegal trafficking of drugs to the United States has caused violence in our cities. And the illegal trafficking of weapons to Mexico from the United States has armed the Mob in Mexico helping aid the violence and corruption. Most of the Drug Cartels' revenue comes from the movement and distribution of marijuana. They use the money they make from marijuana to transport other drugs such a cocaine and heroin. Though this maybe an unconventional method, the best way to end this war is by making marijuana legal in the United States.
To back this argument, the following points will be elaborated on: How Drug Cartels use marijuana to make money, what the Drug Cartels do with the money, how the war has caused illegal marijuana farms in National and State parks, how the United States will benefit from legalizing marijuana, and how Mexico will benefit from legalizing marijuana. These points have peer-reviewed resources, journals and articles to make sure that all the information is credible.
Drug Cartels make most of their money through the illegal transport of Marijuana into the United States. Because marijuana is illegal in the United States, every dollar made through transactions of marijuana goes directly into the hands of criminals. These hands do not have to be hands of criminals. They can be the hands of hard working farmers, middle class workers and the United States Government. By keeping marijuana illegal, it allows for Drug Cartels to slip past us and build farms, underground drug trades, and a war in our own backyard.
According to msn.com a crop of 20 marijuana plants is worth over $100,000. These drug cartels have hundreds of thousands of plants at each farm that they operate. With a farm of 100,000 plants, an annual revenue of over $500,000,000 can be considered at each farm. All the crops are sold and traded all over the United States illegally, imagine if the United States made marijuana legal. As it can be seen, drug cartels make most their money through marijuana.
The Mexican Drug Cartels use this money for various other things. The most dangerous is buying guns and other weapons to send to Mexico to fight the war on drugs. By cutting off the supply of money, the drug cartels would be unable to move the guns and other weapons to Mexico, thus putting a halt on the drug war. Not only will it halt the movement of weapons, the drug cartels would be unable to move other drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Though the main revenue of money comes from marijuana, there is still a demand of heroin and cocaine.
So by cutting off the main source, you can further shut the cartels down of all their other sources of money. Another use of this money is used for buy-offs of officials of the Mexican Government, Police Force, and even the Mexican Army. These buy-offs are used for easy transport of goods through the country and across the border.
Another epidemic has begun to come on the rise threatening innocent hikers, tourists, and now the National Park ecosystems. ""National Parks' Pot Farms Blamed on Drug Cartels: Mexican drug lords find it easier to grow in state than import."" This headline is from the San Francisco Chronicle and is a story about the Drug Cartels now taking over National Parks for marijuana farms. The guards of these farms used to run from the rangers of the parks, but now they stand up to them with larger weaponry.
""Hikers in national parks such as Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon are encountering a danger more hazardous than bears: illegal marijuana farms run by Mexican drug cartels and protected by booby traps and guards carrying AK-47s."" (SFC, page 1)
The Cannabis Plant is not native to every part of the world, and planting it in places where it is easily spread uncontrollably will cause problems to an ecosystem that could take decades to reverse.
""The illicit pot farms can also cause environmental damage. Growers often cut trees, dig ditches, create crude dams on streams, and haul in plastic hoses and other equipment to irrigate the plants. Fertilizers and other chemicals used by growers pollute watersheds and kill native species. Last year, the Park Service spent $50,000 to clean up tons of litter, debris and human waste at pot farms that were discovered or abandoned."" (SFC, page 1)
Not only will the plant itself destroy the ecosystem, but also the trafficking that the cartels use to transport marijuana out of the plants is detrimental to the environment. The use of vehicles, waste products, water waste, sewage, and trash from these farms are all problems that are occurring, and the cartels could care less what happens to the land.
Aside from the waste problems, the biggest problem is the clear cutting used to make room for the farm. The trees being cut are certain populations and species of trees that are crucial to the survival of the ecosystem. Each tree and organism of an ecosystem has a role in the survival of the whole. When these drug cartels come in and build illegal marijuana farms, they disrupt the balance and cause huge problems that the Park Service will be facing for decades to come.
""National Park Service officers seized about 60,000 marijuana plants, with an estimated street value of $240 million, from parks in California. About 44,000
Pot plants were removed from Sequoia National Park near California's Central Valley. Another 10,000 plants were seized in Yosemite National Park."" (SFC, page 1)
Cartels used to stick within the Emerald Triangle, an area surrounding Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties in Northern California. Within the last ten years the Cartels have stretched all cross California, taking advantage of the mild temperatures and climate. Because of the higher security across the Mexican border, Cartels have found it easier to grow in the United States rather than import. The Cartels have gone to great lengths to protect their crops using booby traps and 24-hour guards. Hikers have been chased away at gunpoint, and there was an instance of a hiker being detained and his life threatened if he told authorities about the location.
The demand for marijuana in the United States is the cause for the problems in the National Parks. If marijuana were legal, it would also be legal to grow it in a farm. Therefore, farmers would buy their own land rather than using the National Forests. This would also keep the Cartels out because the government would buy the marijuana sold in stores, first. And if it were grown illegally, the government would know and take action upon that source.
With the eradication of illegal farms and the demand for marijuana from Mexico, the Drug cartels would lose all their funding and would be unable to transport drugs like heroin and cocaine into the United States. This would also cut off the transport of weapons to Mexico to fight the drug war.
Legalizing marijuana will benefit the United States in a couple of ways. The first of course is the reduction of the amount of incarcerations and the amount of arrests. Arresting criminals off the streets inevitably costs a lot of money. According to Milton Friedman, $7. 7 billion dollars per year is spent on just the arrests of nonviolent marijuana related crimes. As of right now, the United States is in a marijuana prohibition, which is costing the United States enormous amounts of money. If the government were to replace this prohibition with a taxation system, it would provide the government a total between $10 billion and $14 billion dollars per year (Friedman, pg. 1). 530 distinguished economists endorsed the report. An open letter was sent to the president regarding a debate about considering putting a halt on the marijuana prohibition to help stimulate the United States economy. There would of course be regulations on the amount of marijuana allowed on a person, and of course a fair taxation would be put in place. The taxation would be the same as alcohol and tobacco.
The end of the marijuana prohibition would also help the United States at the border. Because most of the revenue the Drug Cartels receive is from the marijuana trade, legalizing marijuana in the United States would take the money out of the Drug Cartels hands and into the hands of the government and the citizens of the United States. The legalization would also keep the violent drug crimes out of the country because those criminals from Mexico have no reason to move to the United States.
The incarceration of nonviolent drug crimes is also a huge problem that would be solved if marijuana became legalized. ""Marijuana accounts for 47% of all drug arrests"" (Klein, pg 1). With and average of $60 thousand dollars per year per incarcerated criminal, if one-hundred criminals were incarcerated, forty-seven of them would accounted for a nonviolent marijuana related crime. For those one hundred criminals, $6 million dollars would be spent just to keep them in prisons every year. $4. 7 million dollars on one hundred criminals could be saved every year for the government if the nonviolent marijuana drug crimes were thrown out because marijuana became legalized.
Since the 1980's, a problem has been brewing in the south. Drug Cartels in Mexico have started a pandemic that has been wreaking havoc for the past 20 years or so. The money has been flowing into the hands of criminals through a drug called marijuana. This drug is illegal in the United States, and the Drug Cartels have been making billions of dollars per year through the illegal trade of marijuana. Because the drug is illegal in the United States, money is lost to a number of things. Those things include, wasted money on incarcerations, wasted money on arrests, and the submission to violent marijuana farms in National Parks. The citizens of the United States are being arrested for the possession of marijuana and nonviolent marijuana related crimes. The money can be saved if marijuana was to be legalized in the United States.

"Why is ageism in workplace such an issue these days? 
No matter how talented or experienced an employee is, workplace history has demonstrated more than just a few times that the younger candidate is often the one to win the promotion. Age discrimination has become more than a minor societal problem throughout the time; indeed, the issue has become such a popular topic and problem within the workplace that people are dying to wait for the laws to be enacted in order to solve the problem. 
In order to help protect those who stand to be singled out and let go because of the unfairness of ageism, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) was designed with the older employee in mind. The issue at hand is that companies are not willing to hire younger workers or older workers, choosing instead to push them out of the loop rather than attempting to incorporate them as valuable potentials. Today, the general perception, or common belief is that younger workers can bring energy, deftness, and bareness but they are not fully experienced enough to bring profits as the experienced workers can. With older workers, who are around 50s or 60s, are believed to have decreasing interest, lack of innovation and imagination, and a lessening of the quality of the person. 
Recently, job seekers are reporting age discrimination beginning as early as the mid-thirties. How can this be addressed? What options are there for people who are considered ""old"" or too ""young"" by hiring managers and companies? Should they just give up and do nothing? The biggest issue, the one that is hard to address, is the universal perception that older workers are not as quick or adept as younger workers are and the younger workers are not experienced, na ve and always on 'don't know what to do' mode (Fleck 1). 
Age discrimination continues to damage our society, reducing both the incomes and the self-confidence of millions of Americans. However, there are counterarguments that claim why the nation should pay too much attention to this problem. To hire a employee, who is capable of bringing abundant profits later in the future, is the main goal of hiring managers in workplaces or companies. To achieve it, workplaces must choose people who are capable of keeping up with the work and doing the job that they are told to do without any problem. But the age should not be one of factors that workplaces must evaluate during job interviews. There are numerous workers who are either young or too old who are capable of doing the job that they are told to do instead of lagging behind others. For example, a bank hires a pretty, inexperienced young woman as a teller instead of an older woman with a strong background in similar jobs. In this case, the age should not be the factor that prevented the old woman from getting hired. It is how much experienced the woman is compared to other, which is most important. It is not that older workers are generally more experienced that workplaces should favor older workers much more than the younger one because the age does not determine whether the person had an similar experience in other workplaces before or not. So, it is erroneous for workplaces to judge the worker just by appearance or the age. They should hire the worker thinking whether this worker would be suitable for themselves or not. 
Age discrimination is sometimes allowed to continue because of long-held assumptions from workplaces that it is right and proper for older workers to move aside to make room for younger workers who need to support families, that older workers are less competent, and that there's no mileage in training them for new jobs. Surprisingly, however the unemployment rate for younger workers are much higher than that of older workers. There is nothing wrong to hire the younger workers because they have potentials of bringing the same amount of profits as current workers do. The 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects most workers 40 and older from discrimination in recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, pay, benefits, firing, layoffs, retirement and other employment practices. However, it should also protect the younger workers from those factors, too.

"Women in STEM 
Purdue University 
April 14, 2015 
Introduction 
STEM means science, technology, engineering, and math. The STEM workforce is pretty crucial to modern society. However, there is a gender gap in STEM fields where women are largely underrepresented. Attracting more women to work in STEM is really important. STEM shapes our future, improves our world, and makes our lives easier. 
Engineering is the most gender-segregated area. According to the statistics, only 20 percent of engineers are women (NSF, 2011). While 20 percent of engineering graduates are women, only 11 percent of them are practicing engineers (NSF, 2011). My interest is to find out why there are fewer women in STEM, and there are three reasons: family commitment, salary gap, and inequality in the job market. 
Discussion 
The first reason is our society has a stereotype that women are less likely to be good at math and science. ""Most people associate science and math fields with ""male"" and humanities and arts fields with ""female,"" according to the research examined in this report."" ( p16). Such self-assessment limits girls' interests in STEM fields. The report proves that at an early age, girls and boys differ little in math grades. However, when girls and boys transition from high school to college, the gender gap widens. 
Also, society expects women to take care of their families. The study shows that girls start to feel their family stress even when they are in colleges. According to the professor Gabin said, when women go into the job market, companies sometimes refuse women by saying women cannot commit themselves as men because of family responsibilities (2015, Gabin). Women in STEM are more stressed and long-hour working is pretty common in STEM. It is shown that women in STEM have fewer children. Only 40 percent of them have children compared with 80 percent of women in other non-STEM occupations over period from1971 to 1991 (Blackwell and Glover, 2008). 
The second reason is that women in STEM earn less than men in STEM. Women in STEM fields earn more than women in non-STEM fields. However, from the statistics in the report, women in STEM fields usually earn 33 percent more than women in non-STEM fields. (p1). The report demonstrates that if a man can earn a dollar, a woman only can earn $0. 84 of it. The gender wage gap discourages women from going into STEM fields. 
The report suggests that women earn less because they commit themselves to families and it caused by partially discrimination and partially their choices. I disagree with the opinion that women earn less because of family. For many situations, women work as much as men do, but they still earn less. I find out a statistic shows that unmarried and childless women still have less salary. Even the wage gap has been shrinking in the last five years, we still have such discrimination. Moreover, women are less likely to get into management positions why women earn less compared to men. 
The third reason is discrimination in the job market. There are fewer women in STEM jobs which means fewer women get into management positions. Women lack mentors which is challenging for them because it is hard for them to find support. Sometimes male mentors give them pressure. Studies show that female professors and career role models can positively impact a student's aspirations for a science-related career (2015, Mc Collum). Such models can motivate more women to go into and stay in STEM fields. However, the competition among women discourages them to go into STEM. Women who are in high positions do not want to be replaced by others since those positions are limited. Such pressure may still be caused by men because they try to limit the spaces for women ( Gabin, personal comment). 
Purdue is trying to help female STEM students. As far as I know, Purdue has a program called Women in Engineering. This program is for supporting female engineering students. They organize activities regularly and invite guests to give a speech. It helps them to know other female engineering students and build connections. Also, the dean of college of engineering at Purdue is a lady, which gives students a good model for women students. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, there is discrimination in the STEM fields. Moreover, this discrimination is associated with the gender roles such as family commit and gender wage gap. More women go into STEM fields; however, it is still fewer compared to non-STEM fields. The society should try to create a good environment to encourage women to get involved in STEM fields. Therefore, we will have better products and more diverse ideas.

"Offering Tea Art Course for University Students 
When I worked in teahouse most customers, relatively educated middle-class, did not know how to prepare tea properly, and some of them even did not know basic manner when they drink tea. The most common way people drink tea is simply mix green tea with boiled water which temperature is too high to destroy vitamin C, resulting taste bitter. Obviously, Chinese tea culture is fading away from Chinese life. Hence, it is urgent to preserve our own tea culture, and the most efficient way is offering tea art course as interest course for university students. Through the tea art course, students have a chance to learn Chinese tea culture and tradition. Beside, when students study tea art course also improve their relationship with each other. More importantly, tea is also good for their health rather than other beverage. 
Some people may complain about that university is place for academic study not for personal interest. In addition, there are schools aimed for tea art study. Hence it is not necessary to offer tea art course for students in university. It is true that there exist tea art schools for people to study, but most of those schools are highly in charged one-to-one study that most people cannot afford it. The high coat for learning tea art contributes the decay of Chinese tea culture. Besides, like art class, tea art class teaches students how to appreciate aesthetic, which also is an important composition of university class. A lot of friends of mine show their interests in tea culture, but they do not know how to study. If university provide tea art course for students, it will provide an opportunity for students to study tea art in low cost. Though the class, they also learn about Chinese tradition. 
During the interview with Dr. Pettit, he mentioned that tea paly an important role in our social life. In Saberi's article also talk about the importance of tea as medium during the business conversation. Therefore, providing tea course for students in university also could improve students' relationship. In nowadays, people especially youth cannot live without mobile phone and laptop. They prefer to text to others and talk through mobile phone. When people hang out with their friends they still spent most of their time on those advanced technology. It seems that students are getting away from each other. However, tea curses hold in tea party form will enhance students' communication and improve their friendship. A 2003 article by David Grigg stated that tea is related to Zen Buddhism. Dr. Pettit also stated that ""We can drink tea at home instead of going to Buddha siting and participating in Buddhist ritual, which also strengthening your awareness sense and creating different sensation of difference perception."" Hence during the tea party we have more serious topic like Zen Buddhism or daily affairs to discuss with each other in a relaxing way. 
All kinds of beverage saturated everywhere, however, those beverage contains high calories. From the chart of HBO indicates that every 12 ounces of cola contains 136 calories, and even every 12 ounces of 100% apple juice contains 168 calories. Compared with those beverages, every 12 ounces of unsweetened iced tea only 2 calories. It is obvious that drinking tea is wise for weight management. In Rongping Ruan's research Tea Consumption and Mortality in the Oldest-Old Chinese pointed out that drinking tea improve survival and longevity. Offering tea art class encourages student form drinking tea habits which benefit their whole life. After students learn to how to prepare tea and drink tea properly in tea art class, they can drink tea instead of cola when they feel thirsty and enjoy the process of preparing tea. 
Considering protect Chinese tradition culture, improve student's relationship, and intensify health management, offering tea art class for university students is necessary. After class, when students drink at home, they also could teach their family members how to drink and prepare tea properly which also enhance family membership. During tea art class, teachers are not only supposed to teach tea ceremony but also tea history. If the condition permit, school can organize filed trip to mountain that cultivated with tea tree to watch how leave become all kinds of flavor tea, which also trigger students' interest about tea.

"Argumentative Essay Draft #1 
Dietetics in China: pursuing other countries 
	As a developing country, China has its own distinctive dietetic career and educational system from other countries in the world, but this system is poorly developed as well-known and requires more regulations and improvement. The demand to change the current situation is apparent. However, the direction of changing becomes a controversy, whether building improvement upon original system or standing in a line with other countries in the world. As a dietetic student and a Chinese, both identities make me think standing in a line with others is the best way for China. I came up with this conclusion from several perspectives, such as global impact, progress of scientific research, and human resource. They are discussed and explained in detail in the following. 
	One reason that China must reestablish a dietetic system like other developed countries is global impact. According to Sun and Dwyer (2013), more than 40 countries in the world joined an organization named the International Confederation of Dietetic Associations (ICDA), and their dietitians follow the international standards presented by ICDA. This is how dietetic system becomes globally standardized in most countries. One most important factor that causes current chaotic status is that China is not a member of ICDA, making China isolated in this field. Now, no one is supervising the operation of dietetic system in China. Therefore, flaws exist everywhere without regulations. However, The global impact is very influential. If China joins ICDA and builds a dietetic system based on international standards, the situation can be improved to a great extent by relying on global impact. Other members of ICDA would monitor and supervise China in order to ensure the ICDA standards are executed strictly as in other ICDA member countries, Thus, the current unregulated situation can be terminated with the supervision of ICDA. 
	Global impact is not the sole reason that the dietetic system in China needs to be parallel with other countries. The consideration of human resource of dietetic professionals is another crucial aspect. Because China doesn't have a formal dietetic education in college, more and more young people who are interested in dietetics, like me and Sun(2013), choose to study abroad in order to learn the most advanced dietetic knowledge and develop required practical skills in this field. Dietetic students normally pursue registered dietitian(RD) credentials after they graduate from college. However, this RD credential approved by the United States, which is widely recognized by the members of ICDA, is not recognized by China since their dietetic systems and standards are different. Therefore, Chinese dietetic students who receive a RD credential in the U.S. have to stay in foreign countries for job even though they eager to contribute to the improvement of human health in their home country, China. Gradually, China would not have dietetic professionals who have received the most advanced dietetic information to improve overall public health, so that the dietetic system in China can only become even worse and underdeveloped. However, this possibility can be eliminated by establishing a dietetic system on the basis of international standards. Therefore, dietetic professionals in other countries would have an opportunity to devote themselves to the progress of dietetics in China when the dietetic system in China is internationally standardized. 
	In addition to global impact and human resource, progress of scientific research in nutrition is another aspect that demands the internationally standardized dietetic system in China. From the interview with Sun who is a registered dietitian in Johns Hopkins Hospital, I know that nutrition is a fairly new science compared with other physical sciences and there are still a lot of unknown things to be discovered. Since dietetics is a study based on nutrition science, progress of scientific research is crucial for dietitians to provide dietary consulting and health care with quality and updated new knowledge. If dietetic system in China becomes standardized with other countries, Chinese dietitians will be able to communicate and exchange the information of newly updated research with other countries in order to reach the co-development and advance in this field for the purpose of improving human health. Furthermore, Chinese dietitians and dietitians from other countries will have the chance to conduct research and facilitate the development of better health care together. 
	Despite of all the potential benefits of becoming internationally standardized, some people still think China should improve the dietetic system based on the original one because they think the international standard doesn't apply to China due to the unique dietary culture in China. Chinese herbal medicine is one of a kind in Chinese diet. Chinese believe herbal medicine is capable of preventing disease and improving physical conditioning when it is cooked with other food ingredients. These people oppose the international standards since they think it is difficult for other countries to understand how Chinese herbal medicine plays a role in diet and also difficult to explain how it works due to culture and history uniqueness. However, in fact, their concern is not inevitably true. The obstacle can be overcome by analyzing the chemical composition of Chinese herbal medicine. Although nutrition scientists and dietitians may not be able to understand the traditional Chinese medicine, they can easily recognize its chemical composition and immediately know its function according to chemistry. This is a doable thing, and some scientists in China already start to analyze the chemical composition of Chinese herbal medicine, expressing traditional Chinese medicine in a way that is understandable and appropriate for people from other countries. Therefore, these conservative people who contest applying international standards to Chinese dietetic system should be open-minded and accept newly updated items. 
	For above mentioned reasons, China has to reestablish a dietetic system with international standards in order to reach progress of nutrition science research, provide job opportunities and developing space for dietetic professionals, and, the most important one, have other members of ICDA to supervise the operation of dietetic system in China, preventing the chaotic status from happening again. Because of these promising improvements, becoming international standardized in a line with other countries is a must-do thing that requires immediate action.

"Argumentative Essay 
Title 
Internet trolls refer to the people who send many off-topic messages to disrupt people's normal discussion and make people angry. As the size of the Internet continues to expand, the actions of trolling have also evolved. For example, some radical trolls hacked the Facebook accounts of dead people and played jokes by sending inflaming messages. Surprised by its great impact, society starts to pay more attention to the Internet trolling. People try to come up with solutions of Internet trolling, such as banning trolls' accounts. Many users of social network sites have been enraged by trolls, and some users even receive death threats from Internet trolls. Therefore, some people think the government should make Internet trolling illegal in order to control the negative impact of Internet trolling. However, even if many users think Internet trolls are annoying, making Internet trolling illegal might not be an effective solution. 
People who support prosecuting Internet trolling have several ideas which sounded reasonable. First of all, they claim that Internet trolling has already caused physical damage to the victims. For instance, a 16-year-old girl named Jessica was found dead at her home. Her profile on Ask.fm, a website where users can post questions on their pages, showed that she was branded ""fat"" and ""a slut"". It is certain the Internet trolling made her under pressure and indirectly caused her death. Therefore, people suggest control Internet trolling by law is necessary. Second, some people claim that letting the government control Internet trolling will be more effective than letting the administrators(admins) do. During the interview with <name> , the CEO of Wow technology limit company, <name> told me that the admins of the online forums could hardly control Internet trolling since the trolls can create new accounts immediately after they are banned. If the government can take part in controlling Internet trolls, these people are certain that the number of trolls will drop quickly. Third, they suggest that the offensive messages sent by Internet trolls are not included in freedom of speech. Thus, Internet trolling is not protect by the First Amendment and should be restricted. In the following paragraphs, I will rebut these oppositions with reasons and examples. 
The first reason for not making Internet trolling illegal is that many bad results of Internet trolling have already covered in other current laws. Many people suggest that Internet trolling has taken numerous people's lives by making the victims feel like they do not need to live. Therefore, they suggest Internet trolling should be considered as a crime and be punished by laws. It is true that Internet trolling causes some negative effects which violate the law. However, Internet trolling is a vague and broad term, which includes several aspects of actions, such as upsetting others and interrupting normal discussions. While threatening to harm others is clearly risky, whether interrupting normal discussions should be prosecuted is still questionable, since this kind of Internet trolling only make people annoyed instead of making them in grief. Therefore, because of the vague meaning of Internet trolling, making Internet trolling illegal will result in difficulties during enforcement process. Also, these injurious results of Internet trolling have already covered by current laws. For example, in Britain, Malicious Communications Act 1988 suggests that any person who sends to another person any article or electronic communication, which is of an indecent or grossly offensive nature, is guilty of an offense. Therefore, making Internet trolling illegal is neither practicable nor necessary. 
The second reason for not prosecute Internet trolling is that proving the intent of a threat from the Internet is really challenging. There are many people believe that since the small social network sites fail to control Internet trolling due to their limited technology and funds, the government, which has greater power and more resources, it is able to track Internet trolls and send them into jail. To some extent this thought is true. Definitely, letting the government track Internet trolls will be more effective than the administers from social network sites. However, tracking Internet trolls is only the first step of controlling Internet trolling. Proving the intent of a trolling message also plays an important role. According to Claire Hardaker, an academic from Lancaster University who studies online aggression, proving that the Internet trolls really mean it when they send threat messages and they really had the means to carry it out is very difficult. Certainly, Claire suggested, when you received a message from a stranger on the Internet that said ""I am going to kill you"", there was a possibility that this guy really meant it. However, for example, if your mum sent the same text, she might simply be angry because you forgot to bring something she asked for. Therefore, since the police had to figure out the real intents of the Internet trolls before arresting them, the effect of prosecuting Internet trolling will not be as great as people imagine. 
Outline 3rd Paragraph: 
It's true that offensive threats is an exception of freedom of speech, but there insufficient reason to engage the law if only the content is in bad taste or unpopular.

"Abolishing Death Penalty for A Better Legal System in China 
Purdue University 
Abolishing death penalty for a better legal system in China 
After rapid and extensive developments for almost four decades since the beginning of the reform and open-up policy, China has achieved a lot economically and socially. The policy not only provided the ancient country the opportunities and windows to knowing the world, but also helped transform the country with more civilization and justice which was severely destroyed by and during the Cultural Revolution. China has devoted itself to become a country which is ruled by laws rather than by people. However, death penalty still exited and has been widely used in a long period of time. Despite of the fact that death penalty has deterrence value and been a retribution to serious crimes, it is also true that wrong execution will definitely harm human rights as well as the justice and integrity of a legal system. The issue is interesting and worthy a discussion especially because China has set the strategy of ruling by law yet preserved death penalty.(Jiang, 2013). It is important to transmit the idea that abolishing death penalty is a necessary and crucial step to build a better legal system rather than a fruit of the latter. Proponents of death penalty mainly considered that the punishment is a necessary retribution and has a deterrence value. Accordingly, analysis will be carried out from perspective that wrong executions rendered will reversely damage the justice and human right that a legal system that tried to uphold and protect. What's more, abolishing death penalty may also help minimize the damage caused the flaw and inadequacy of the system. 
Deterrence value and retribution rank the top reasons for people to support. According to a multinational research carried out by scholars from three countries, they found that more than half of the respondents from the China considered that death penalty is an appropriate method of retribution and has good deterrence effect (Jiang, Lambert, Wang, Saito and Pilot, 2010). Meanwhile, the proportions in the US and Japan are relatively smaller by 10% to 15% (Jiang et al., 2010). Although the accuracy of surveys was limited by the quantity and scales of the respondents, the result still reflects some common senses on the issues shared by people from different countries. Retribution, or more commonly known as ""an eye for an eye"", is an ancient form of justice which can be traced back to Code of Hammurabi and Hebrew Law. To equal the seriousness and punishment of a criminal behavior is a fundamental principle under a modern legal system. To countries with a legal system, death penalty will be only adopted to those who committed felonies which are stipulated in penalty codes after long procedures. The severity of death penalty has considered to bring good deterrence effect. In Japanese society, deterrence effect has been the number one reason for people to support the extreme punishment. This country even expressed their favor for capital punishment on occasions such as the UN general assembly (Jiang et al., 2010). It can hardly deny that death penalty indeed has positive value for punish criminals and warning others. However, wrong executions sabotage and weakens the justice and human rights that a legal system tried to protect. In addition, the deterrence effect is not as lasting and good as proponents claim. 
China has attached great importance to death penalty in light of its deterrence effect and retribution. However, wrong execution took place all the time which seriously damage the justice of the legal system(Jiang, 2013). There were many typical cases of wrong executions in recent few years with the popularity of internet which provides rapid method for news to broadcast. One of the most typical cases is She Xianglin case. Before being arrested for the suspect of murdering his wife, She Xianglin was just an ordinary peasant in remote countryside of China. She Xianglin kept appealing to higher courts since being sentenced death. After rotted in jail for about ten years, She Xianglin was proved to be innocent and released. Although he was lucky to spare his life and compensated economically, he can never retrieve his youth and has to be regretful for missing his mother's funeral. There is no doubt that not everyone was as lucky She Xianglin to gain freedom again. During the last two decades of the 20th century, China had adopted unprecedented policy of ""Strike Hard"". She Xianglin's case was a miniature and a tragedy of the era. The so called ""Strike Hard"" policy was designed to upheld the justice and improve chaotic social order by using server punishment and deterrence. According to a study by Trevaskes (2008), the figure of high crimes soared from less than 70000 to over a million in 17 years. Although the official has never public announced the figure of death penalty, it was not hard to estimate the scale by the case of She Xianglin. The fact proved that by using death penalty to intimidate people and control the crime rate was a failure. The wide use of death penalty not only caused wrong execution which sacrificed the innocents, but also against the policy of ruling by law and broken the justice and human rights. Without rectifying it timely, a legal system can hardly be complete. 
Proponents also showed their concerns about the possibility of abolishing death penalty in China as they believed death penalty was no more than a result of current legal system. Indeed, death penalty can hardly exist independently away from a legal system nowadays. However, it is just the flaw and inadequacy of the current legal system that calls for the abolishment of death penalty. Despite of the efforts, China has not yet established an independent legal system. Current legal system is not only capable of making wrong executions(Trevaskes, 2013), but also being misguided by irrational factors and deviate the track that meant to be. Few years ago, Chinese people seemed to be pissed by Yao Jiaxing who accidentally injured a woman and stabbed her to death. The court planned to sentence Yao Jiaxing a life prison considering the factors that Yao's family tried to compensate the victim's and Yao has surrendered himself. However, under great pressure from the public because the medias twistted Yao's image, the court had to decide him an instant death penalty. (Miao, 2013). It was sad that both family lost one of their members. What's more pathetic was that the tragedy might took place again without abolishing death penalty under an incomplete legal system. 
Death penalty is an issue that has raised great controversy. In a modern society, death penalty has very close relationship to a legal system. It is commonly considered that death penalty is a result of a verdict according to the laws. People think highly of the deterrence value and retribution effect of death penalty. However, wrong executions took place from time to time. The most terrible thing of wrong executions is that it might irrevocably deprive one's life once for all. What's worse, it also damages justice and human rights which are deemed to be the core of a legal system seriously. There is no perfect and flawless legal system. As a consequence, it is necessary to abolish death penalty so as to minimize the system failure caused by it. China has made a few steps in construction of its legal system in the past few decades. However, a better legal system can hardly be built without abolishing death penalty as it damages the justice and human rights which are the solid foundation.

Should college students select their major by themselves? 
When students graduate from high schools, they can choose to work or pursue a higher education. Students who choose to continue their study trip can learn more professional knowledge and get a degree. The degree will influence the students' resume when they apply for a job. The professional knowledge will help students solve some challenging problems. Before students got a certification and learnt those knowledge, they have to select their major at first. The major can decide which degree students will get and which type of knowledge that students can study. Most students do not experience selecting a major before. Thus, should students let their parents decide their majors? As most parents work for a long time, they know how the major will affect future work. Here, I want to share my opinion, which is students should choose their majors by themselves rather letting their parents select. 
One reason is that an interested major will help students achieve their future goals. One significant reason that parents want to involve in is to help their children have a good life. If the interested major could help children founded a good life, it will be considerable for children to choose major by themselves. If a student chose his interested major, he would spend more time on study. Spending more time on study, the student can absorb more knowledge and get more practices. The knowledge and practice that students have studied will help students solve their future problem. Also, it will help students achieve their goals. Namrata Shrestha is a graduate student. She wrote an article named ""Don't let parents decide your destiny"". She originally chose to a medical major for her parents, but she was not interested in this major. After she studied for a period of time, she said ""I no longer wanted to spend all my life doing tedious lab work in a [medical] research lab.""(Namrata) Then she changed the major into her interests, economics."" I definitely enjoy my classes this year more than I did last year. I would rather have a hectic 9-to-5 job, as long as I have a reason to wake up every morning and look forward to another great day at work."" She said.( Namrata) My instructor, <name> also has similar experience. He selected history as his major at first, but he could not find his future goal. After he realized his interested major was education, he changed his major into education. Then he found his future goal and made a plan of his future. From Shrestha and <name> 's experience, I can conclude one thing that is the interested major help them achieve their goals and brought a good life for them. 
Another reason is college students should become independent. As most students grow up, they have to study how to solve problems by themselves. As we know, most parents will prefer to set a schedule for their children before the children become adults. If the students select the major by themselves, they will have a responsibility to schedule their own plans. To make a plan by themselves, students will need to collect some resources, analyze the resources and write down a specific plan. When the students become more self-contained, they will be likely to solve problems well by themselves in the future. Parents will not worry about their children any more at that time. Parents can help their children by giving some suggestions at the first year. because most students need a direction to help them solving problems. After the students can find the direction to solve problems by themselves, parents should give less and less suggestions. According to Agliata and Renk's research, without parents guiding, most freshmen cannot adjust their college life well in the first year. As the communication with their parents increased, most students' adaptability of living in college increased. However, for the third and fourth year, the adaptability of living in college for students increased as the communication with parents decreased. The data also showed the students who get the higher adaptability will be more likely to find a self-worth. Finding the self-worth will help the students made a plan of their future. More independence, more problems solved by themselves, more self-worth they found. 
Moreover, too much parents' control will directly cause the children feel less satisfaction and more depressions. As the children grow up, they will have their own thoughts, and desire to express them with other people. This self-expression will help the students find mistakes and overcome them. After making less mistakes than before, they will feel satisfied and brave to express their own ideas. However, too much parents control will limit their thoughts as students cannot express their thoughts in the plan. After a long time, students will think they are the puppets which means they are not required to have a personal thought. Then they will feel more depression of their life. After their parents stop ""manipulating"" them, most students will hardly survive in the society. Schiffrin and his partners made a report of students parents controlling and students' satisfaction feeling. Most of students who got many helicopter parenting would have high level depression and less satisfaction with life. Helicopter parenting means parents will watch and give orders to their children. However, when the helicopter parenting behaviors decreased, the satisfaction with life for most students increased. The data also recorded students who have many satisfaction feelings will more enjoy their future lives. Therefore, too much parents' controls will give students' more pressure and less satisfaction of life. 
In Conclusion, I think students should choose their major by themselves. First reason is students' interest will help them come true their future goals; another is more independence will help students survive in the future. Moreover, too much parents controlling will give them a huge pressure and make them feel less satisfaction of life.

"Have a Right Recognition on Social Media 
P5D3 
Nowadays people have been so familiar with social media. It has been a part of our life that can not be separate. The debate of social media that whether it is harmful is still hard to make a conclusion, which makes it difficult to get a completely right point. Whether support the social media or not, people start to realize this technology brings more than the convenient communication , but also a deep influence to people. So my point on this is , we should be subjective on this new technology, we should both know the merits and disadvantages of this which would be a rational choice and make the best outcome using social media. 
Many people judging social media through their feelings while using it. Some of them feel happy when they post new photos and get response from others. Some of them think differently, they have undergone a depression when they saw others showing off their lives on social media. But really few of them are clear about what social media exactly brings to them. People still know nothing about social media, or they know that they have different feelings while using it, but they don't know the reason. Many of them judge it from their own perspective, they form their opinion objectively, but their opinions maybe wrong. In my opinion, we should have a full recognition on it. We should start to study its good side and bad side , so that we can use it wisely. 
The promotion of social media have many reasons. As a new technology , it is really helpful. There are several merits. As a professor in the field of communication, Glenn Sparks mentioned some obvious good aspects of social media in the interview. This kind of site stimuli people's creativity, helps people to be exposed in more amount of information, put people in contact with a great diversity. It also enhance the relationship between people, especially the people who are in distances. I believe that everyone has a certain extent of joy through using social media. Besides these features that everyone knows, there are some other merits that people didn't see. Social networking sites help students do better at school. 59% of students with access to the Internet report that they use social networking sites to discuss educational topics and 50% use the sites to talk about school assignments.{2} (The sited article are listed at the bottom) Social networking sites spread information faster than any other media. Over 50% of people learn about breaking news on social media. Social networking sites are the top news source for 27.8% of Americans, ranking close to newspapers (28.8%) and above radio (18.8%) and other print publications (6%).{1} Being a part of a social networking site can increase a person's quality of life and reduce the risk of health problems. Social media can help improve life satisfaction, stroke recovery, memory retention, and overall well-being by providing users with a large social group. Additionally, friends on social media can have a ""contagion"" effect, promoting and helping with exercise, dieting, and smoking cessation goals. {6} Obviously , this technology is influencing society. 
But although social media is undoubtedly good to us , it still become a big issue. Because as we use it more , we find it is not so perfect as we thought. Actually , we all experience the harm social medias had did to us, mentally. We may feel frustrate when we using social medias. Also we may be too addicted to it that we had lost so much concentration on our real life. Social networking sites can lead to stress and offline relationship problems. A University of Edinburgh Business School study found the more Facebook friends a person has, the more stressful the person finds Facebook to use. According to a Feb. 9, 2012 Pew Internet report, 15% of adult social network users had an experience on a social networking site that caused a friendship to end , 12% of adult users had an experience online that resulted in a face-to-face argument, and 3% of adults reported a physical confrontation as the result of an experience on a social networking site.{3} The use of social networking sites is correlated with personality and brain disorders, such as the inability to have in-person conversations, a need for instant gratification, ADHD, and self-centered personalities, as well as addictive behaviors.{7} Pathological Internet Use (caused or exacerbated by social networking use) is associated with feelings of loneliness, depression, anxiety and general distress. {4} Social media causes people to spend less time interacting face-to-face. A Jan. 2012 Center for the Digital Future at the USC Annenberg School study found that the percentage of people reporting less face-to-face time with family in their homes rose from 8% in 2000 to 34% in 2011. Social networking sites facilitate cyberbullying. 49.5% of students reported being the victims of bullying online and 33.7% reported committing bullying behavior online.{10} And I can list as many facts as I can show that social media actually is becoming a serious problem. The alert is already on, we should be careful twith social media. 
Although right now we can only be clear about part of the technology, but the attitude to be subjective and trying to figure out the truth is helpful for us on social media. 
As I once put in the interview and sythensis paper, my point is that technology is neutral. They are always there, what matters is how we use them, how we deal with the inherent defect triggered by technologies. We are adapting creatures. We need to learn, to understand what we had invent , so that we can fully control it.

"Chinese Basketball can turn back on correct track 
Purdue University 
04/14/15 
My standpoint is that Chinese basketball can get back on the right track. In my view, as long as three problems are solved entirely, Chinese basketball can get back on the right track. These three problems are the refereeing issue, output of outstanding youth basketball players and management of Chinese basketball association. Concerning refereeing issue, I think that the government should pay money to better train a new generation of referees, and these new referees should be sent USA to be trained and developed better. Chinese Basketball Association also should make strict and detailed rules to manage the referee organization. For example, to set a very severe punishment to alert referees to regulate the behavior of their own. In the matter of elite youth basketball players, I think the key to solve this kind of problem is to create a perfect college basketball association, like the NCAA .NCAA rules prevent student-athletes from receiving money, transportation, or any extra benefit or expense allowance not authorized by the NCAA legislation. This includes benefits from an agent or any agreement to have an agent market the player's athletic ability or reputation in that sport. Laura.F (2012,March 27) . Extra Benefits: Student-Athlete Violations and NCAA, and this pretty good college basketball association can give poor college basketball players enough financial support. This association has to be just and equal. If Chinese basketball creates a nice college basketball association, not only provide a platform for gifted young guys to show themselves, but also one outstanding youth player can choose which college he wants to after graduating from high school , which demonstrates that getting high test score is not only way to good college."" With regard to the management of the Chinese basketball Association, I think that the Chinese basketball association can learn some from the NBA. In the NBA , there is an organization, which is responsible for supervising the operation of the NBA, consists of a few NBA players. If this organization finds out some notorious records from management of NBA, it can apply for strike of NBA players. This independent organization can help the NBA operate regularly, So, the Chinese basketball Association can mimic the NBA. Step by step, management of the Chinese basketball association will be clean and upright. 
Some basketball reviewers think that Chinese basketball may not recover any more. The reason is that they criticize that the important factor of Chinese basketball becoming awful is Chinese basketball association had been corrupt and venal. However, reviewers make sure that it is impossible to change and rectify the current situation of the corrupt and venal Chinese basketball association. The Chinese basketball association consists of many small sections which are responsible for their own obligation, and these all small sections are deeply connected. Thus, no matter what to renovate any one section, every section will be affected and changed. Maybe, the whole Chinese basketball association will be broken drastically. What's more, due to the corruption of Chinese basketball and the current situation of Chinese education. Students are forced to only focus on high scores in school, fewer and fewer elite youth basketball players are developed by Chinese basketball. It is a vicious circle that is not easy to be gotten back on the right track. 
To sum up, as long as the Chinese Basketball Association has enough determination and courage to re-input new and professional referees for Chinese basketball association, and learn the method of NBA management, I make sure that the Chinese basketball must be successful though Chinese basketball can face so many difficulties at first.

"	There has been much debate recently about the usage of artificial uterus. It is a theoretical device that would allow for extracorporeal pregnancy or extra uterine fetal incubation by growing an embryo or fetus outside of the body of a female organism that would normally internally carry the embryo or fetus to term. Some see it positively because it reduces the pain when giving birth and the death rate of pregnant woman, and gives hope to the sterile. Others see the artificial uterus as a negative way that could actually violate the nature. They insist that it could lead to abuse such as military training or black-market organ sales. Thus, a balance should be made between the importance of one's life and the nature. I propose this solution: The government should make a restriction on who could use the artificial uterus under these three conditions: 1) only women are allowed; 2) the artificial uterus is only allowed to those who are officially diagnosed as sterile; 3) if one has already received the uterus, she is not permitted to use it again. 
CONCLUSION: As our technology and science develop as time passes by, the society is rapidly changing as well.

"Argument essay 
Purdue University 
(Draft 1) 
Argument essay 
	The world is becoming more and more competitive and everyone seems so busy doing their own things. Everyday we have so many tasks to accomplish and there are so many things that distract us from study or work . However, not many people can finish all of them on time and tended to move to the next day to get over them. As a result, people get into the condition of delaying everyday's work and are gradually getting accustomed to it which leads to failure. It's because they are being put in a tight spot that they lack time management skills. With good time management skills, they can perfectly complete all the tasks and be more competitive in the world. It's obvious that time management is an indispensable factor for success. 
	First of all, time management helps to build a sufficient day. Time management serves as an assistant to help plan the whole day and get a clear outline of what to do and when to do which is really important for whole day success. Raven(2010)indicates that time management helps people to find priorities and be more productive. With a good time management, people can get a list of things needed to do and know the priorities so that they are not going to miss the most important thing. Also, doing the priorities can help people to have a better mood and be in a suitable pace finishing all the things left. However, if people lack the skill, they will totally have no idea of when to do the things, which leads to a mess and a disorder day with a bad arrangement . What's more, they may miss the opportunity to do the most important thing which may affect a lot! 
	Since time management serves as an efficient tool to improve efficiency, it helps a lot in the academic field. Time management skill is positively related to the academic performance and behaviors. Students who master a perfect management skill is more likely to enjoy a high GPA. With a clear mind of the things going to do, students can get a good timeline and can utilize the best of the time which results in their high GPA. According to the writers, 76 questionnaire items are created by them to research on the college students and found out the result that students with a poor GPA are bad at time management compared to those with a high GPA. Students who often hurry to finish the homework or project is poorer than those students allocate their time well and complete all the work before the scheduled time . For example, as a senior and the director of PUCSSA, Mushi made a good time management plan to keep his success. He would think over and have a detailed plan before the day. What's more, the plan he made is flexible to finish all the things. Plans he made consider many different factors including transportation and conflicts. The reason why he enjoyed such a high GPA in the four years serving as a director and TA at the same time was all because his high efficiency caused by the good time management skills. As Mushi said,"" Time management helps me save a lot of time and every time I finish all the things as scheduled, I feel a great sense of accomplishment.I really appreciate the skill and I'm definitely going to practice it in my career life.""Moreover, he thought the reasons for some students who have a low GPA are the bad time management skills because some of his friends spend most of the day playing while hurrying several hours before the time that is due. 
	Time management is not only important in study field but also very important for the career development. time management is the most important factor when taking about the completion of the tasks. Researchers(2010) conducted an experiment on employees to investigate how the work goals are completed. They got the result that ""task completion is more related to time management than overall performance.""Employees are required to accomplish a lot of tasks during the workday and it's really important for them to follow up all the tasks required. At this time, time management plays a crucial rule in helping people to accomplish them in a good sequence. With a good time management, they can clarify the best time to do each thing and whether to do them at the same time to pursue a high efficiency and make the best use of time. Time is definitely saved and high efficiency is enjoyed. 
	According to the three evidences I list above, it shows that it's true that time management is important for the daily completion of work and the efficiency. However, there's also a few students around us achieving good marks but spending their day playing games which shows that they don't arrange their time well and have a poor time management. Those persons do exist because they may have high IQ and may have already learnt them before so they don't take time reviewing the material. However, time management is a really essential skill to master because it helps to set up a more efficient day and easier to achieve success. 
	All in all, time management is an indispensable factor to success while most students and employees lack the skills to manage time efficiently. Time management helps to improve the efficiency and enjoy a better day with a clear list of things going to do which is the strong base of success. People should be more aware of the benefits of good time management skills. Ways to improve it include making a excellent plan ahead counting in all the possible affecting factors and practice it as scheduled. Insist in it day by day and overcome all the laziness and the intention to delay. Success will finally knock at the door.

"P5d3 Argumentative Essay

Argumentative Essay on Swatting: A Hoax with a Deadly Sense of Humor 
Swatting, a term that is becoming even more popular among gamers by the day. But what exactly is 'swatting'? To sum it up briefly, it involves a delinquent making a prank call to force the police to send in a SWAT team to the premises of an unaware and innocent victim. As you can see, swatting is a big problem in the USA and it is considered a dangerous crime. Despite that fact, efforts to neutralize swatting have had a run into a stone wall. In my opinion, the greatest reason is because people do not consider swatting much of 'a big deal' and hence does nothing to prevent it. However, I believe swatting should be regulated quickly and efficiently. In order to do so, we must increase its public awareness and heavily involve certain parties to do their part in stopping this potential threat which include: the police, the legislature, the hackers, and the general public. 
First, let us talk about what our law enforcement agencies can do. Since swatting revolves around a fake emergency call to 911, our constabulary should create a system that can differentiate between prank calls and real emergency calls. They should also change the way they respond to such cases. Instead of immediately sending in an entire SWAT team to raid that area, they could first send one or two uniformed personnel to check the actual situation. If these precautions still fail, they could redeem themselves by quickly locating the suspect. This is because usually the perpetrator could remain unknown despite of months of searching. 
Next, I argue that lawmakers should create stricter punishments to swatters. Swatting is still rampant due to the fact that it does not justify a harsh enough punishment. In the event of someone going to trial for swatting, the court would usually only sentence them to house arrest, probations, fines, or a year or two in prison. I think that something as dangerous as swatting deserves a more severe consequence, such as ten years of imprisonment. However, some people would argue that most swatters are either children or teenagers and that any rougher penalty would be going too far. I strongly disagree with their statements. Even though they are minors, they should also be prepared for the aftermath should they even dare to swat. This is because swatting involves risking human lives which should not be taken lightly. Therefore, they should be judged equally as an adult despite of their younger age. 
Ever wondered why the police tend to either take a long time to find any suspects or fail in their investigations entirely? This is because swatters usually use sophisticated programs to mask their true identity. To add insult to injury, these applications are readily available on the internet for anyone to use. These applications are provided by numerous hackers for free and they do not require any level of skill to utilize. Because the tools required for swatting is very easy to access, it is no wonder people do it more often. I trust it is the hacker's responsibility to remove easy access to such programs so we can reduce any potential swatters in the future. If we can make it difficult for people to acquire the means of swatting, then people would turn away from the practice. 
Finally, the efforts of the people mentioned above would be in vain if individuals like us do not support it. For that reason, we should concern ourselves about swatting as well. But what can we do about a problem as difficult and complex as swatting? For starters, we can simply raise awareness about swatting to other people. This can be done by sharing information about swatting to the close people in your lives and tell them to spread the message. If the government sees that many people think this is a problem, it will give them an incentive to act in haste and decisively. Furthermore, we can prevent the swatters themselves if they happen to be someone you know. You can lecture them about why swatting is a dangerous prank and hopefully stop them entirely. 
Swatting could be very troubling if we do not start handling it from now. If we are to be successful, it is best if we take early precautions before the problem can no longer be contained. This is why I urge everyone to do their part to set these precautions into effect. Law enforcement agencies should make sure that the emergency call is real. Legislators should impose strict laws to prosecute swatters. Hackers should remove the means swatters use to do easy swatting. And ultimately, we should spread the word about swatting and be aware of anyone around us who could be a swatter. Hopefully, these types of efforts could eventually erase the practice of swatting.

"Justice and females' suicide rate 
Suicide rate never stop to slow down. In all over the world, most countries' female's suicide rate is lower than males, but in China the rates are different. I think, some particular concepts in China intrigue this phenomina. Before I discuss the relationship between justices and females' suicide rate, I'd like to talk about Justice. Justice is hard to be realized but human being never stop pursuing it. However in this process, people are still making mistakes, which cause injustice. People use morality and law to realize justice, but even in a modern society, some moral principles are wrong and some law cannot be effective. 
Morality can help human being to be more decent but sometime it can be a shackle. In rural area, some Chinese pay a lot of attention on morality but not on law. In order to keep them to be decent, they make some strict moral creeds, especially for females. For example, they think it is a responsibility to get marry and give birth to a kid. If a female prefer not to married, she will get in a lot of trouble. Females often face a lot of criticism in Chinese rural society. In under-developed region, females are totally subject to males. If a female try to resist a male she will be cast aside by their society. Like when a husband beats his wife, others would think that it is a normal phenomenon, and the wife should tolerance that, and try to serve her husband better. But if a wife beats her husband, people would think this woman is hateful. Actually, it's illegal for any one to commit domestic violence, but no matter a female is a victim or perpetrator, she often seems to be the guilty one. In conventional area, people are used to use different moral principle to judge males and females. Then females have to face more pressure, which entice them to commit suicide. Females in developed area also face a lot of moral criticism. For example, most of them have face glass ceiling before. Glass ceiling is that female have to face more difficult to get a promotion. And in China, there are still some people think that the most important thing in a girl's life is marriage but not career. So a well-educated or a high income female can be considered to be a loser. In conventional society's opinion, it's kind of immoral for a female to purchase success in professional life. In fact, most females' in developed area face more pressure than males. They have to spend more time to do housework, and if they do not like to do this, they will face harsh criticism. 
Laws are make to keep justice and harmony in a society, but if it can be effective, it's useless. In real life, they are still many cases shows that some laws are not enact effectively. Like for some company, they think male employees are best, married female employees are normal, but unmarried females are the worst. In some people's opinion, unmarried females are unstable; because females tend to quit their jobs or apply for more vacations when they just get married, and most company do not want to offer them this welfare. And some company even fire female employees only because they are pregnant. It's illegal to show discriminations in workplace but due to those companies nearly do not have to pay any cost for their discriminations, females right are infringed. This one aspect shows that how females are face more pressure. Another aspect it that a great amount of people do not consider that some actions are illegal. In some provinces, young girls are forced to married to strangers by their parents. These phenomena are seldom happened in urban area but widely spread in rural area. Because perpetrators do not consider forced marriages are crimes. They think this is their tradition, and if police try to recue these girls, all of neighbors will come out and stop polices, due to they really believe that if polices take those girls back, a ""felicitous"" family would be tear apart. 
Some people argue that morality and laws also affect males lives, why you claim that these issue only enhance females' suicide rate? I admit that males are repress by some morality creeds and laws too, whereas their stress is less than females. There are many restrictions obscure males to purchase their goals. If a male like pink, others may think he is abnormal, just because in the traditional thought, pink is girl's color. Males are forced to be stronger, and aggressive, even they do not like to act in this way. But when a male is taught to be aggressive, females are going to face more risks in their lives. In any society, the powerful can have more resource. As a result, there exist so laws protect the powerful group more than the weak group. Males' income is higher than females, and in conventional Chinese thought, their society are better than females. So when there are problems, males are more easily to get access for help. 
Female's suicide rate reflects their stress. The lower females' status is, the less help she can get from society and law. Some concepts of justice are eternal truth, but some of them are only timely discrimination. Society never stop developing, but even now discriminations exists in every society. Under this circumstance, both morality concepts and laws cannot protect females well. Some of them even only put stress on females. When an individual take great stress, suicide is unavoidable.

"	With the development of an entertainment industry, the public does not only pay attention to artists' performance but also their career development. However, there have been a lot of lawsuits between entertainment companies (agencies) and artists in recent years, especially in Korea because of oppressive contracts. In 2010, three members of TVXQ (a famous Korean pop music band) indicted their entertainment company (one of the biggest entertainment companies in Korea) because of their unfair contract. They won the case and built another band. However, their victory started the lawsuit battle between artists and management companies in Korea. Without any doubt, the phenomenon shows the relationship between agencies and artists go worse, which may influence the artists' careers. However, some people think that is good because agencies are unnecessary and they only know about getting profit from artists. There is another part of people holds the opinion that entertainment companies and artists are connected tightly, which means the relationship should be fixed in order to run both of their careers better. Therefore, some actions should be taken to deal with the poor relationship between artists and their agencies such as building a connected partnership, doing research before contracts and making a contract that benefits both sides. The relationship between agencies and artists is so important that helps artists on career lives. 
	Korean Pop music (K-pop) developed as an important industry in Korea and brought huge economic income. Korean dramas and music have a huge proportion of Asian entertainment, which means they act as an important role in Korean entertainment industry. K-pop is a branch of World Pop music, but it is unique and different from others. Korean Pop music rarely contains traditional Korean musical factors (Kim & Shin, 2013). It is not like Chinese singers, who want to add Chinese traditional musical factors almost all the time. In addition, K Pop mixes simply English and Korean in songs in order to expand the listeners. What's more, K-pop has another nickname, idol music, which means singers' brands are built successfully and the brands help to spread their songs. However, performers are under high pressure because their entertainment management companies' unfair contract that caused many lawsuits these years. This paper is going to talk about how to improve the relationship between artists and management companies. 
	It is possible for artists to build their own entertainment management companies, but this kind of company lacks resources and is full of risk. With the music industry developing, individual musical managers gather and form into an agency, which has a more systematic management system. As a management agency, it acts on behalf of artists and tries to make the right decisions for artists. Artists' managers should calculate the risks, give advice to clients, push artists out of their comfort zone, and help them to reach goals. Different from other management, musical management companies just need to tell their artists plans and decisions (Allen, P. 2011). In addition, the relationship between agencies and artists looks more like a partnership rather than employers and employees. Companies manage artists in order to build a brand and use this brand to attract more talents. Actually, an agency's profit is connected to artists' success directly. However, agencies get paid from artists' income according to the contract between artists and management companies without any doubt. Comparing with professional management agencies, artists' companies have to face a lot of issues such as economic problems, public relationship crises and lacking resources. Artists have to run companies, which means they cannot put their hundred percentage to musical career. If artists cannot focus on music, it will be hard for the company to exist. To summarize management companies take responsibility for artists and how to make more professional decisions such as making suitable plans for different artists, distributing income with reasonable rate and solving clients' personal crises. 
	Compare to other countries, Korean entertainment management system gives more pressure to artists. As mentioned in the paper, Korean entertainment industry leads Asian entertainment. In Korea famous entertainment management companies such as SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YJ Entertainment have auditions yearly in order to find talents. However, there is not only the competitions between different entertainment companies but also appear among artists even in the same company. Generally, agencies suggest that the talents be trainees after entertainment companies select them. Companies have several evaluations every month to test trainees' improvement in order to choose who has the opportunity to stand on the stage. If a trainee does not work hard, he might be kicked out of the company. He can either choose to continue attending auditions or try other jobs. Once companies decide to make contracts with trainees, trainees accept harsh terms because they have already practiced for years. However, when trainees become famous artists, many of them will ask to fix contracts either through negotiation or lawsuit. 
	Agencies and artists are connected closely (partnership) and a trained contract can protect both sides' profit besides trust that means artists' leaving hurt both artists and management companies. For management companies, they cost both long time, and economic support to rebuild a famous brand for artists. In addition, it cuts the profit from artist's income. From artists' aspects, there are a lot of harms if they decide to change entertainment companies because the management company not only manages artists' careers such as selecting songs and residents but also control their personal life like dating and marriage (Weiss, M., & Gaffney, P. 2012). Creating a contract that makes both clients and agencies feel that they have won can help to build a stable relationship. To summarize, evaluating agencies carefully and making a fair will help to build a long and stable partnership besides the main support, trust. 
	Artists can represent themselves in order to have more income. Entertainment companies look forward to high profit all the time, so they do not follow the contract, sometimes in order to get money as much as possible from their clients. However, professional management companies have systematic solution for problems, which means artists can focus on music. In Korea, writing contracts carefully before signing is important though competition brings much pressure to artists. The point is management agencies and artists are connected tightly and they need each other.

Globalization and the increasing number of overseas students had attracted people's attention on English teaching since 1980s. People started to realize that English teaching was problematic in China. Either the Ministry of Education or some private tuition centers have tried a lot of ways to change it, but problems still exist. To further improve English teaching in China, I think Chinese Ministry of Education should improve English examination system. One way to achieve this is to specialize English examination. 
First and foremost, specializing English examination reduces unbalanced development of students' functioning in English. As English teaching in China is exam-oriented and English examinations in China now focus only on testing reading and listening skills, speaking is unvalued in Chinese schools. Thus, students are not given many opportunities to practice speaking English, but required to put all their efforts in reading passages and memorizing vocabularies in schools. Canceling examination is not realistic as it is still the most efficient and fair way to test large population of students currently, so the Ministry of Education should create an examination that specializes in testing spoken language which will underline the importance of speaking and force teachers to change their teaching methods to adapt to the new examination. Thus, students are provided more chances to speak English and English teaching in China will be more integrated. 
Secondly, the English examinations in colleges are too general to fulfill the different needs of different majors. CET-4 and CET-6 are the only two standard English examinations in colleges which are compulsory for every college student and colleges provide students compulsory English course to study for these two examinations. However, according to Lin (2002), the English courses in colleges cover only general English vocabularies and grammars which repeat parts of the English knowledge in high school, thus, for students who have to learn professional vocabularies in their majors, this kind of general English course is useless and they still need to study professional English by themselves. So she advised colleges to introduce more types of examinations to test different abilities. Based on her opinion, I believe that colleges should specialize English examinations for different majors to make English teaching in colleges more efficient and more helpful for students. This also help students prepare for applying graduate schools in foreign countries. 
Last but not least, as I have mentioned above, every college student has to take CET-4 and CET-6, and these two examinations are used to measure students' English level, however, I think this measurement is unscientific. For instance, students who study history and students who study literature must be required to know different categories of vocabularies, so they should not be tested by the same examinations which will result in an inaccurate reflection of students' real level. Also these general examinations cannot show their English level in their professional fields. Thus, specialized English examinations for different majors provide a more comprehensive evaluation for students' English proficiency. Also, the score of the specialized English examination will be a more persuasive reference in one student's resume. 
Some may argue that specializing examination in colleges for different majors requires large amount of resources and costs a lot. However, I believe that any reformation requires abundant inputs at the very beginning. And education is worth to invest as it is related to a country's future. Also, as the courses and examinations now repeats the knowledge in high school, these can be considered as a waste of resources though they cost less. Comparing with wasting the resources, I think investing more resources and creating a more efficient education system is valuable and sustainable. 
Other people may think that testing speaking will not improve students' spoken language but limit them because teachers will teach them some standard format to cope with the examination. And this will cause students to express in a single way. However, I believe that the ultimate goal of specializing the speaking examination is not testing speaking but to attract schools' attention on teaching speaking skills and drive teachers to value speaking in their classes. It is true that many teachers may provide students standard formats to help them speak, but this also helps students build confidence in speaking when they score well. I believe this is a effective method to start the reformation. 
In an exam-oriented education system, examination is the best tool that we can use to influence the teaching methods. When we cannot cancel examination, the best we can do is to improve it. Thus I believe specializing English examination is an effective way to improve English teaching in China.

"Homeschooling began a long time ago because parents find there are many problems when their children go to public school. So parents decide they teach their children at home. At that time homeschooling is beginning. Until now, homeschooling is still increasing. According to Kreager (2010), ""Homeschooling in the United States is the fastest growing sector of K-12 schooling. Also the National Center for Education Statistics estimated that 1. 1 million students received their schooling from home in United States in 2003"" p.227-253. When parents send their children to public schools, there are many problems that might happen. They can find their children injured in the public school. Also parents feel their relationship with their children is distant. According to Walsh (2001), ""Homeschooled children have the time to learn unencumbered by bullies or troublemakers who don't wish to be at school in the first place"" p.14. So when parents decide to teach their children at home, they become teachers. According to Miners (2008), ""Parents believe the homeschooling of education is superior to formal schooling"" p.26. So homeschooling is better than public school. Although some argue that homeschooling is damaging their children and make their children have poor relationship with other students, homeschooling actually has many benefits, such as many clubs for homeschooler to join and improve their friendships.
Figure 1. Source: U.S. Department of Education. Condition of Education 2009
First, parents are best teacher when they teach their children. It means parents make the children love learning. The most important thing when children study it that they need to be interested it what they study. However, in the public school so many students study together. Each student's personality is different. Some students personality is cheerful but some students personality is shy. So shy students when they have question, they don't ask the teacher. Over time, so many questions accumulate that they can't follow the lesson. Consequently they feel learning is boring and they don't like to learn more. Conversely, if parents teach their children they may avoid this problem. Almost all children like their parents and like to communicate with them. So when they have questions they ask their parents. According to Lyman (1998), ""Parents provide their child with useful and interesting educational experiences"" p.64. So when parents teach their children it is benefit for their children also parents are best teacher.
Second, homeschooling improves parents and children's relationship. It creates a love for each other and strong family relationship with good communication. However, in public school there are so many students in the class and there are just one teacher to take care of these students. The teacher can't know every students opinion and what they want, but parents know their children, what they think or what they want, so homeschooling can be more effective for children. According to Bennett (2007), "" Parent involvement in early intervention programs may enhance the parent-child relationship by providing the parent with increased feeling of parent competence, new understanding of child development"" p.381-397. So when children have good communication with their parents, it will benefit for their development.
Third, when children homeschooled they are independent learner and they can get high score on standardized tests. When children are homeschooled, parents are in control of their children's education. It means parents know what their children need. However in public school there are formal schedule. Public school students just follow the schedule to study and they rely on peer approval, so they can't study what they need. Some public students when they graduate they don't know what they study but homeschooler actually learn because parents know what their children need and what parts they should improve. The main point is their children are often self-directed in learning their own rules and skills. They also avoid reliance on peer approval. Because homeschoolers are more interested and motivated they become more successful in their studies. According to Sorey (2008), ""Homeschoolers will gain greater ground in higher education"" p.22-28. It means homeschooler can get high score on standardized tests and better than public school students.
Figure 2. Academic Achievement of Home School, Catholic/Private and the Nation's Students
Some have argue that homeschooled children do not make friends or learn social skills. This is a good point. However, many clubs such as drama clubs and sports clubs exist for homeschooled children. Also, the homeschooler schedule is similar to that of public school. So they can meet and join clubs communicate with other homeschooler also they can learn social skills in the clubs. According to Sofla (2010), ""Students from homeschools and traditional schools have been found to attend extrafamilial social activities with the saome frequency, belong to the same number of organization"" p.98-104. So not only public school student can make friend or learn social skills. Also homeschooler can make friend improve their friendship or learn social skills through the activity of some clubs.
Homeschooling
Clubs and Activities for Homeschoolers
Figure 3.
Some argue when homeschooler study at home it is boring time and they are lazy. According to Romanowski (2006), ""The homeschooler usually wake up at 9: 00 A.M. So they lack of the concept of time"" p.125-129. When they study, they just discuss with their parents. They can't like public school students make a group discuss issues and share others opinion. That is a good point. However, when parents teach their children it can be responsible. So for the concept of time, parents are strict control the children's wake up time. Because parents don't hope their children become lazy students. Also when they study at home they can't feel boring. Brostrum (1997), Homeschooler they would like more books on music, the arts, communication p.106. So when they during study, they can play the music. It can be more effect their study. Contrary in public school when they study, they whole time just sit and listen to teacher's talk. It can be boring during the study.
Some argue when parents teach their children, they can't do best. It means some parents just have high school education or low education. That is a good point. But when parents decide teach their children, they will prepare their plan before they teach their children. For example, they can learn from the Internet or library. Usually, parents brain is faster than children. Usually, parents don't teach their children all the life. They teach their children until high school education. And then they will take their children to go to college. So parents fully qualified for their teaching. According to Joyce (2008), ""Almost all parents can be involved in learning activities at homes"" p.227-294. So parents can learn more education during teach their children children's education.
Some people argue homeschooling can be unstable thing planning. Because sometimes parents have important events so they have no time care for their children. That day children can't study anymore. That is a very good point. However, when parents have important events, they can give their children study plan or some work. When they come back and check that. Parents have important events, so they can't teach their children, so they can use the gift, promise their children if they do well the work without their parents, parents will give reward their children.
In conclusion, when parents decide their children take the homeschooling it is benefit way for children. Because homeschooling make the children learn better get high score improve parents and children's relationship. Also parents know what their children opinion and what part they should study. Although some people argue homeschooling is harmful for children, but to show these reasons it is not big problems for homeschooler. Contrary public school has more problems than homeschooling. That why homeschooling is fastest growing. So homeschooling is benefit for children also it is good way for children.

Extended Argument
Michele Beier
Reasons for Allowing Underage Persons to Drink
At the age of eighteen you are considered a legal adult; meaning you can vote for political leaders, buy tobacco products, enlist into the military, make decisions on your own without first the consent of parents, and you are free to do as you want with your body, such as getting tattoos or piercings. Nowhere in that list does it mention that you can drink alcohol. This seems quite unreasonable because turning eighteen for many teenagers defines freedom from their parents, becoming responsible and dependent on themselves, and making their own decisions about their lives. In this paper I will demonstrate why I believe it is in the United States' best interest to lower the drinking age to eighteen.
Turning eighteen brings with it many responsibilities. Turning eighteen means you can now purchase your own car; purchase an apartment, house, condo, or anything of the like; purchase and pay for your own credit card; and decide the country's future leaders. Responsibility is one thing that many people think teenagers lack. To counter that, I know many teenagers with a credit score better than most grown adults and they pay for everything with their own money, not their parents. If we are trusted to decide the country's leaders and are pushed and urged to vote in presidential elections, then why can we not drink. If we are ""responsible""
Barnhart 2
enough to be trusted to make the decision for our country, why can we not make decisions in our own lives to drink alcohol? We can make the decision to smoke tobacco, which is way more harmful to your body than alcohol will ever be. We can purchase our own places of residence. Is that not responsible? Living on your own, when you are eighteen, and affording it is not responsible? I beg to differ. Being responsible means being accountable for your actions. I have to admit though; some teenagers are not in any way responsible. But putting the future of the country in their hands is something we want to give them and any teenager. Putting their own life in their hands with the ability to purchase and legally smoke cigarettes is more reasonable. Letting them drink alcohol is not part of being responsible though.
One of the most disturbing facts about the alcohol consumption age is that young men and women are allowed to enlist in the military and risk their lives and shed blood for the nation but are not allowed to consume alcohol. Figure one is a picture of the front lines of the army where we can put eighteen year olds. This is completely unjust because if they are allowed to fight on the front lines for the country and put their life on the line, they should be able to consume alcohol. Soldiers are considered mature and are looked up to to defend our nation, but even at eighteen, when they are allowed to enlist without a parent's signature, but they are still not allowed to drink alcohol. And for what reason? There is no logical defense against that. My boyfriend has been in the military since he was eighteen and he says that shipping out to go fight for this nation without being able to drink alcohol and celebrate his leaving was one of the hardest things for him. Watching all his buddies drink and have fun, he just felt like he was missing out. It just does not seem fair, he goes overseas to give us and let us keep the freedoms we have, but yet, he still does not get to fully enjoy those freedoms. The United States is founded
Barnhart 3
on freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of basically everything. Alcohol is legal in the United States, unlike in the 1920's, but the freedom to drink it is limited. Seems like it goes against our country's moral beliefs.
Prohibiting the sale, use, or consumption of any product will not prove to be fully effective. In January 1920, the states ratified the eighteenth amendment, prohibition, which placed a nationwide ban on the manufacture and transportation of liquor. By the mid-twenties congress realized that the amendment had not been as successful as they would have liked. With this observation came improved enforcement. Money for this improved enforcement was increased from $6. 3 million in 1921 to $9. 2 million in 1925 and finally to $13. 4 million in 1930. During this period, bootleg alcohol became popular to make and drink since alcohol was banned, people would come up with other ways to get the ""forbidden fruit"". It was noted however, that the amount of consumption had decreased in the early stages of prohibition. As this states, you cannot prohibit the sale, use, or consumption of a substance because people will violate this law. People will always do what they are told not to do, it is human instinct. Eighteen year olds, even twenty year olds, will drink. They will get alcohol from anywhere they can. Getting a fake identification card, getting a bum to buy it, getting their friend who is twenty one or older to buy it, there are so many ways around this law it is ridiculous. But the repercussions if you are caught, to put it lightly, suck. You have a court date, a parole officer, community service, and fines. I feel that the penalties are not even great enough to make an underage drinker never to do it again; they just make you paranoid about drinking at parties.
Barnhart 4
More and more, underage drinking is becoming accessible to minors in more settings. Especially in college, where kids are away from their parents, most likely, for the first time and now have a sense of responsibility and, best of all, freedom. With this new found freedom kids are getting completely inebriated and making risky decisions they generally would not make while sober. 1,700 college students aged eighteen to twenty four have died from alcohol related deaths each year, 599,000 college students get unintentionally injured while intoxicated a year. When a person has drank too much alcohol their body will shut down involuntary actions like breathing and vomiting which leads to alcohol poisoning. Seizures are also an after-effect of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol poisoning is one of the leading causes of death in underage drinkers. Figure two represents what can happen when a person gets alcohol poisoning. I personally have a friend who this occurred to and had to be hospitalized because of a seizure from alcohol poisoning. Thankfully, she is alright and well and had very little negative effects on her life. Many people are afraid to call emergency services when someone is in danger because they do not want to get in trouble with the law. In order to avoid this, they try to give the person in need the proper attention and care which may end up fatal. If they would have just called emergency services they could have kept the person alive but for the fact that they are drinking illegally, they do not want to get in trouble. This is one reason why the drinking age should be lowered. It would save more lives because people would not be ashamed or scared to call for help.
Flavored alcoholic beverages are aimed at today's youth internationally by marketing and advertising. Figure three shows what a wine cooler looks like. Even though underage drinking is not allowed in the United States, in many other countries it is. By creating these new beverages that are flavored to the likes of the youth, the alcohol companies may not realize it, or
Barnhart 5
it could possibly be intentional, that the flavors are aimed at the youth, pressuring them into trying them. These flavored alcoholic beverages are designed to make the transition from soft drinks to alcohol easier for young people. The flavored alcoholic beverages mask the taste of the alcohol and have relatively low alcohol content but still enough so that it has an effect on an inexperienced, or even first time, drinker. In 1991, the United States Department of Health and Human Services conducted a survey on underage drinkers to see how young they started drinking. Conducted on 956 seventh through twelfth graders, the findings were unreal. It found that junior and senior high school students drank thirty five percent of all wine coolers sold in the United States. It also found that wine coolers were the favorite alcoholic beverage among forty two percent of students that drink. The studies were conducted in other countries as well and the findings were just as bad, if not worse.
Driving intoxicated is unsafe, and very costly in Arizona, because the possibility of killing or injuring another human being is extremely likely. Your reaction time and motor coordination is slowed by alcohol. When drinking was legal at age eighteen in certain states, many people did not think twice about driving drunk. My mother was of legal age to drink during this time period and continuously tells me stories about how her and her friends would drink at bars and then drive home. If a police man pulled them over, there were no consequences, he would just tell them to make it home safely and have a good night. The society has changed drastically since then. Many people may argue that teenagers are still maturing at 18 and they're bodies are not capable to handle alcohol. In fact, the National Institute of Health states that the brain is not fully developed until you are twenty five. So either way, twenty one or eighteen, your body is still maturing and the damage done is the same.
Barnhart 6
Another very common argument is that lowering the drinking age will mean higher alcohol related automobile fatalities. When this was measured, the vehicles were not put together very well and were not sturdy in any way. Now-a-days, the vehicles are as safe as can be and are sturdier and better built than even twenty years ago. Figure four shows how many airbags are put into new cars. Thanks to the invention of airbags in every possible part of new cars, injuries are still possible but are way less common than when the legal drinking age was eighteen. Legal actions for driving while intoxicated have been revised in the past twenty to thirty years to really crack down on drunken drivers.
Purchasing tobacco is now legal when you turn eighteen. Tobacco is the number one leading cause of preventable death killing 438,000 people a year. 23.9% of eighteen to twenty four year olds smoke cigarettes, which is the highest of all age groups. Although eighteen to twenty one year olds can make the decision to smoke cigarettes and take years off their life, they are still unable to make the decision to consume alcohol. So, we can let them smoke tobacco which is horrible for the environment and other people, and even worse for a human body, but we cannot let them make the choice to drink alcohol. Being an adult means that you can make your own decisions and do what you think is right and make decisions that affect your life. In my opinion, choosing to drink alcohol is not as bad as smoking tobacco.
I am not saying to just completely let eighteen year olds go out and drink at bars; I mean to say that making them go through alcohol classes and receiving some kind of award for their commitment to be a safe drinker is more reasonable. Implementing a system for each age, eighteen through twenty one, which will let them have more freedoms of drinking. Since sixteen
Barnhart 7
is the legal age to drive, having two years' experience of driving before turning eighteen will be beneficial. Becoming eighteen will mean that they will have gone through the alcohol classes and will then have a breathalyzer put into their car as a deterrent to drunken driving. Turning twenty one will mean that one; the breathalyzer is taken out of their car, and two; they are free to make the decision on whether to drink and drive or have a safe sober ride home. This seems more feasible than to just say no drinking until you are twenty one. I am friends with many twenty one year olds and they are all just as ""immature"" as eighteen year olds. Sure, they may be farther in college, or have a well paying job, but they drink and drive more than anyone and that is by far one of the most dangerous things a person could do.

"P5D1 Argumentative Essay 
April 15th, 2015 
Are Purdue's LGBTQ Center Anti-Discrimination Programs Effective? 
	The oppression of sexual minority groups is not new - but, due to the slow progress society has made over the past few decades, it is fair to say that in this modern day and age, sexual minority groups such as the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) group are slowly integrating themselves into the community and are shunned no longer. Especially on college campuses, where young adults are beginning to experiment with their sexual preference, it is even more imperative to design effective anti-discrimination programs that would protect these young adults should they find themselves identifying as LGBTQ. As such, this essay aims to consider whether Purdue's LGBTQ Center should come up with more effective solutions to combat LGBTQ hate crime so to protect the welfare of LGBTQ students. 
	One particular program that Purdue's LGBTQ Center has coordinated for the past two years is the Safe Zone program, whereby volunteers are trained to identify hate-crime incidents happening against LGBQT or minority students, and report these incidents accordingly. In addition, by the end of the training, volunteers are also given a placard that indicates that as being allies of the LGBTQ community. In a personal interview conducted with Dr <Name> the <position>, <Name> mentions that the amount of reports being made have increased, while the amount of actual incident rates have actually gone down. According to <Name>, more than 2000 individuals have volunteered to sign up for the program, and the numbers are increasing each year. These phenomena are indications that the Safe Zone program is in fact effective in reducing LGBTQ hate crime. 
	Besides the Safe Zone program that the LGBTQ center has coordinated, the center also hosts a wide variety of programs every semester in order to educate the public on the dangers of LGBTQ hate crime as well as disseminate relevant information. Such programs include inviting notable speakers to give seminars on recent LGBTQ news, as well as hosting requested panel sessions to discuss any related LGBTQ news. More notably, the center has also partnered up with Purdue's residence hall services to provide a gender-free, inclusive living community for LGBTQ students. This provides an extra level of protection for students against possible hate crimes. With that in mind, on a recent article written in 2014 by Perez and Hussey from the Center of American Progress, they suggested that in order to ensure that students are shielded from discrimination and hate crime, college campuses should provide resources for students and faculty to discuss discriminatory events that have happened to them. This strategy is reflected in the various programs that Purdue's LGBTQ center have hosted, in which they actively aim to disseminate information on how to identify and interrupt discriminatory bahaviour, and therefore indicates that these programs are helpful in protecting the welfare of LGBTQ students on campus. 
	However, as mentioned during the personal interview with <Name>, he says that up till now, there has been no official statistics released on whether these programs do indeed correlate to a decrease in LGBTQ hate crime on campus. As the center had only opened three years ago, the span of time the center has been in operation is too short to conduct research on the impact of these programs. With that being said however, the center does in fact keep track of how many volunteers have been through the Safe Zone program, and while that number is not released officially on Purdue's webpage, it is still an indication that the program is effective. 
	In conclusion, whilst there are no official statistics released on the effectiveness of the Safe Zone program coordinated by Purdue's LGBTQ center, however based on the growing numbers of volunteers as well as placards being placed around campus identifying volunteers as LGBTQ allies, it is safe to say that the programs offered by the center are useful in protecting LGBTQ students from any possible discrimination or hate crime. Moreover, the LGBTQ center also has a designated safe zone in its center that aims to provide students with a safe space to converse and hang out in general. As modern society progresses, although the discrimination and prejudice against social and sexual minority groups have considerably lessened, however it is still necessary to take preventative measures.

"The Most Important Piece of the Puzzle 
April 19th 2015 
Purdue University 
21st century sports are filled with fanatic fans that support their teams so excessively that they see it as a religion. Fanatic fans that passionately support their teams live their lives based on their team. The psychology of a fan and the relationship of a fanatic fan with his team shows similarities between a fan's identification with his team and how people can be identified by their nationality, or ethnicity. Fanatic fans are also defined as people who ""are tying up a lot of who they are in their identity as fan of X-team"" and ""derive a lot of their positive and negative affect from what their team is doing."" (Wang, 2006). However, fanatic fans are only half of the story when it comes to modern sports because unfortunately the scandals in sports have took the place of the beauties in sports from the headlines. All illegitimate scandals and incidents hurt sports greatly however, match fixing has been the biggest threat to sports in the 21st century and has to be stopped before it destroys the sports we love. 
Fans are the most important piece of the puzzle that makes up the beauty in sports but unfortunately the recent match fixing scandals and the violence in sports are affecting the fans in many ways. When fans see that what they have paid for, believed in and supported was all a scam they feel betrayed and disappointed. Sports take a big hit this when fans feel betrayed and lose passion because consequently when scams like these happen the fans stop coming to games. In the match fixing incident in Turkey Fenerbahce's president Aziz Yildirim was convicted of forming and leading a criminal gang to fix four games in the Turkish league to take his team to the top and benefit the club with around 58 million dollars by going into Champions League group stages. Although most fans stood by their team's side it wasn't seen as ridiculous. Fanatic fenerbahce fans' supporting attitude for their president is a perfect example of unconditional loyalty, just as most people would expect from fanatic fans. However, even though fans were still supporting the club, they turned their back against the football federation and the government and boycotted by not coming to games. This action of fans did not only greatly hurt Fenerbahce but also Turkish football as well. 
As a result of scandals and disappointment of fans, athletes lost passion too when fans stopped coming to the games and the chain of events brought the greatest danger to the sport we love. After the match fixing scandal and the ongoing investigations, the Turkish League was postponed to another date and most people knew that the leagues might not even be played that year. That was the closest time when a well-known league came to an almost end. Although after months of investigation the court found enough evidence to let the league start, there wasn't enough time to have full year league so the federation tried to squeeze the schedule and have weekday games as well as weekend games. This decision lead to many player's injuries because of the tight schedule and many well know world stars like Emanuel Emenike and Andre Santos have left the league after seeing the situation. Unfortunately that was not the end of the destruction that Aziz Yildirim and his 'gang' caused. 
The scandal tore apart Fenerbahce fans and made them stop coming to the games by boycotting however they found a new way to regroup and 'act as Fenerbahce fans' by violence. Scandals like these that hurt the fans can be seen as losing faith or severe disappointment and so fanatic fans can react violently towards scandalous incidents. In this case Fenerbahce fans turned all their hate to the federation and the government. They protested them violently by starting riots and fighting the police, which made the leagues stop all the time. As we can clearly see this kind of scandals hold the biggest threat against the spirit of the fans and the games we love so much. 
Match fixing is the biggest threat to modern sports and the match fixing incident in Turkey that involved Aziz Yildirim is the best example to see the magnitude of the problems that can be caused by scandals like this. From parting of football stars to riots organized by disappointed fans who want to protest the football federation and the government were great threats to Turkish football and can act as an example of dangers of cheating in sports. Match fixing is a serious risk for the sports we love and has to be stopped immediately.

Accounting Diversity in the Workplace 
As the ideologue and financial regulations vary from country to country, different areas of the world are using different accounting systems, which is known as accounting diversity. In different accounting systems, financial information is used and recorded differently, which becomes a limitation for accountants. Under different accounting education systems, accountants are taught in specific ways of processing financial information, so their accounting knowledge may only be applicable to some specific accounting systems. In this case, accounting diversity may seem to be an obstacle for international employees in accounting area and some claim that those international employees may fail to be qualified accountants in indigenous accounting system. However, based on the research and interview I have done for the project, accounting diversity can actually benefit accountants who are trained internationally in the long run. 
In my interview with [name], a professional in [Business Corporation], she mentioned that accounting diversity does challenge accountants when they are exposed to new accounting systems (personal communication, October 27, 2015). Based on her work experiences in Korean Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG), she pointed out that differences between definitions of technical terms challenge international employees in terms of interacting with professionals in indigenous accounting systems. However, I view the difference as a chance rather than a challenge. Accounting diversity can actually make international employees more competitive in the industry as international and local employees are familiar with different kinds of accounting systems. With an increasing number of companies desiring to build relationships with companies throughout the world, accountants that are familiar with international accounting systems are needed by companies to follow the globalization trend. In this case, international employees have the advantage of bring companies to the global market and help them gain more new customers. 
Accounting diversity helps to prepare accountants for their careers and makes them qualified for entering into the area. During the process of adapting to accounting diversity, international employees can develop the ability of working under different accounting systems and regulations. Considering the changing environment they will face in their daily work, the ability can help them perform well in the area. According to Career Explorer (n.d.), working as accountants takes life-long learning. Since the regulations and information in accounting change frequently, the daily work of accountants can be different. In addition, even different companies have different accounting rules. To keep track of the changing environment and requirements for accountants, being able to quickly adapt to the changing environment and to absorb updated information are critical qualities for accountants. In this case, accounting diversity actually makes international accountants well-prepared for working as accountants. 
As accounting education in different parts of the world is based on different accounting systems, accounting diversity leads to various types of accounting education. Thanks to specialty of each accounting education system, international employees can be more competitive than indigenous employees for having more chances to improve communication skills. In this case, accounting diversity also provides international employees with specific advantages that distinguish them from indigenous employees. 
Based on [name] experiences, she benefited greatly from American accounting education in terms of improving interaction skills, which are of great significance in accounting. (personal communication, October27, 2015). When she was a graduate student in [University], she was exposed to various opportunities to work and to talk with others, ranging from talking to recruiters in career fairs to doing case analyses with MBA students during management classes. By contrast, she also mentioned that in some Asian countries, students don't have many opportunities to engage in classes and socialize with others, leading to their having few opportunities to practice interaction skills. Therefore, being capable of having effective communication with others can make [name] more competitive in the workplace as daily work of accountants requires good interaction skills. According to Career Explorer (n.d.), teamwork is highly valued in accounting. Considering that accounting principles and knowledge update frequently and are really complex, it is fairly important for accountants to work as teams and to share useful information with each other. Thus, interaction skills can be really important for accountants to work effective in the workplace. In this case, Asian students who work in their own countries after graduating from American university may have better interaction skills and play a more active role in the group work than local employees. 
To conclude, international employees can benefit from accounting diversity in more ways than one. Besides preparing them for facing challenges in their careers, accounting diversity also arm international employees with specific advantages that help them have further developments in accounting. To make full preparations for their future careers, international accountants can make early preparations of learning accounting systems that are connected with their work and keep track of changing accounting regulations. Preparing for indigenous Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam may also be a good way to have a comprehensive understanding of the accounting and meet the requirement for being professional accountants in local accounting system.

"Argumentative Essay 
	My topic is about genetically modified(GM) foods. In our daily life, sometimes the food in our meals contain GM crops. When referring to the GM foods, different people have quite different points of view on them. Some people consider GM foods as a good source of food supply while others who oppose the production of GM foods would think they are harmful in a way. In my opinion, the genetically modified foods appearing in current global food market have more benefits than their harm to people. 
	The major reasons why some people stay against GM foods include these following aspects. First, they believe that as most of he genetically modified foods are engineered to be resistant to insects, there will be some toxicants added to them which may be harmful to people. Therefore, they think GM foods has no benefits for people to plant. Secondly, they claim that GM crops will have a risk to the ecological environment that they grow up and may be a threat to the other plants around them. Thirdly, they think GM foods should not be made into products and sold on food market. 
	In terms of the first opposition to the GM foods, I think they are partially right. Admittedly, the toxicants are used in GM foods according to the researches. These kind of chemicals have a chance to cause reaction to some people. However, the amount of the toxicants will not be that large to harm people in a severe way. They are engineered to be better resistant to weed, pest and diseases with those chemicals inside. Therefore, they can be more strong and tenacious to survive in some area that has extreme climate and environment such as drought and cold. [I am going to add more research results and statistics later to support my standpoint] From this we can see, the GM foods are beneficial to people as they can provide foods steadily even in extreme conditions. [I will provide more details and examples] 
	For the claim that GM crops will have a risk to the ecological environment that they grow up and may be a threat to the other plants around them, people who say this believe the GM foods will change the structural formation of the soil as they are like exotic crops. I do not agree with this. Through the researches they show that GM foods have some positive impacts on the environment. [Add research results and examples later] The most convincing example is that in the are of San Joaquin Valley, soil salinity has become a serious problem which means almost no crops can grow up there. Later people found a gene from the grey angrove called ""Avicennia marina"" and transferred it into a tobacco plant. After that, the plant can grow on the soil in the San Joaquin Valley and let local people plant tobacco and make a good use of their soil. This example show that people can use the method of genetically modification on crops and plants to make them have suitable features under different planting conditions so as to make a full use of the soil with different properties. 
	[This paragraph is going to address the questions on GM foods product appearing on market. The examples will be about the GM foods labeling.] 
	[This paragraph will provide more support to my statement such as the work done by the researchers and scientists to improve current GM foods. It will include the sustainability of the GM foods as well.]

"The Impact of Video Games on College Students 
P5D3 
May 1, 2015 
The debates between video games' positive and negative impacts on college students are pretty popular today. Video games have multiple negative impacts on college students' GPA and health, however, the positive impacts of video game on college students are also important and worth to study on.(Granic, 2013) To see the whole picture and know the most suitable role of video games in college students' life, people should notice the irreplaceable benefits from playing video games, such as the improvement on visual attention, teamwork ability and the practice of communication skill. 
	Most research that focuses on the negative impacts of video games on college students all have two things in common, that is they consider all video game players as video game addicts (Christopher, 2015). Secondly basically all of those studies ignored the relationship between the level of negative impacts and the average time spent on video games (Redick, 2015). Dr. Redick (2015) pointed out that the impacts of video games is actually differing from age to age, for college students and adult players, who relatively have better cognitive ability, the impacts is mainly determined by how long you spend on video games. If they only play a few hours per week, it's very likely that they get many benefits on visual perception and other cognitive aspects such as motivational habits with barely any negative impacts. Based on this, simply saying video games bring college students a lot of negative impacts is unscientific, because what gives the negative impacts is not video games but the way you play them. 
	Most parents think that the reason their children spend too little time on studying is mainly because they spend too much time on video games. (Szendrey, 2013) This seems reasonable, however it is not true. According to Szendrey (2013), for college students, a higher usage of video games usually comes with a higher average time spent on study. Szendrey (2013) stated that there are a lot of factors can affect a student to spend less time on study, but we can't just simply think this is because they play too much video game. In another words, even if they stop playing video games, they are still very unlikely to spend that time on studying. 
	Despite those direct impacts of video games on students, the other important reason that the impacts of video games are worth studying is that video games can also impact the method of education. Squire (2003) points out that the development of video games can make the way of learning much easier. The pilot flight simulator is a very good example, this kind of video games allow student pilots get familiar with aircraft and learn to fly a plane without the concern of any safety risks. His research suggested that ""As games become more culturally entrenched, the idea of using games in education may be passing from an opportunity to an imperative"" (Squire, 2013). So, the impact of video games could also change the way of education and make a better education system in the future. 
Although there still might be some negative impacts, but no matter on students themselves or as a tool and a new method of education, video games can benefit college students. But consider all the benefits college students can get from video games and their wide possibility on application to education system, video games are still worth to be study and research. I believe as long as people keep studying video games, we can always lower the negative effects and find more benefits. 
To conclude based on the previous research, video games might seem is just a media for entertainment and relaxation to many people, but with the development of technology, the role of video games to college students is becoming more multiple. Although we know there are some negative impacts, the positive impact of video games on college students are also important and worth to study.

Data Analysis and Virtualization Technology Benefits Training and Learning 
Data Analysis and Virtualization Technology (VR) is a new technology that is developing in an amazing speed nowadays. This technology works with a two - step concept, which is to analyze data first and then use special program and devices to reproduce a virtual simulation of the original objects. Since this technology is widely being discussed, lots of opinions appears towards the development of VR. Personally, I strongly hold the opinion that with development of VR, people's learning style will change and thus benefit a lot from VR. 
In my recent interview to Mr. <name> , who is a <title> working at Purdue University Envision Center, Mr. <name> said that the VR technology is nowadays applied on not only video games but also much more areas that are far beyond out imagination. For example, he said that the Envision Center is dealing with some repair training projects which is required by some car companies. It's usually time costing to teach students how to repair cars, since they students have to actually operate on cars to get a better study experience, and it's usually hard to have so many cars at the same time and keep the safety of not only cars but also all students. However, with the use of Virtual Reality technology, a virtual car reproduction of the equipment was produced and students can actually operate on the virtual car with controllers. In this way, the safety of both cars and students are ensured. What's more, the efficiency of this training is greatly improved since students can repeatedly exercise on the repairing process over and over just with the VR helmet. According to Mr. <name> , companies are willing to pay for those training projects because they found that with the virtual training, the cost of training is actually lowered down while the efficiency is increased compared with traditional training method. 
VR is also used in Astronomy. Abbott, Brian, Emmart, and Wyatt (2004) declares that with the using of a virtual-reality program called Digital Universe Atlas, scientists are allowed to reproduce a 3-D model of universe that simulates the real universe. They illustrated that this simulated universe provides not only science field learners but actually everyone with a closer touch with the real universe. Also, they declared the digital universe makes people feel more connected to the universe they are living in since they are able to see the grand scenery of the solar system just in front of their eyes, which gives them some more feeling of belongings. As we can see, with the VR technology, the education of astronomy became more attractive and efficient. 
Admittedly, there are some drawbacks of VR technology. For example, the price is not so friendly. A VR helmet usually will cost hundreds dollars, which may significantly increase the cost of the learning process. However, when looking at the price of VR devices these years, we can see a significant drop down in the price. The price of HTC Vive is $799, the Oculus Rift is $599 and the recently announced PS VR is just $399. A television will usually cost hundreds dollars, so why not choose a $399 portable personal display system? As we can see, with competition between different devices companies, the price of VR headset is becoming cheaper and cheaper. Even though we still can't predict how well they work, at least we can expect the price of VR headset to become lower as the VR technology become more and more mature. Thus, personally I don't think the price will become a huge problem. 
Above all, I strongly hold the opinion that the development of VR technology will influences and benefits training and leaning process. Since this technology is not totally mature yet, I think more tests should be done on this technology and people should hold a more positive attitude towards the development of it.

"Difference of Mathematical Learning Methods between 
Chinese and American High School Students 
April 17, 2015 
Purdue University 
Author's Note 
Abstract 
This paper's aim was to explore the difference of mathematical learning methods between Chinese and American high school students. To do the research, writer read six published journal articles related to mathematical learning methods, and conducted two interviews with two college students who were good at learning math in their high schools. The conclusion was that American high school students' mathematical learning methods focused on cultivating students' creativity and helping students get profound understanding to mathematical knowledge that they learned. Chinese high school students' mathematical learning methods focused on training students the skills of solving similar mathematical exercises and helping students respond to exercises rapidly. In terms of learning mathematical knowledge, American high school students' mathematical learning methods were better. 
Key Words: mathematical learning methods, high school students, American, Chinese. 
Difference of Mathematical Learning Methods between 
Chinese and American High School Students 
As an important implement widely used in commercial trade and scientific research, mathematics was undoubtedly one of the most important subjects in high school. To have a good command of mathematics, high school students should develop approximate ways to help them learn mathematics. These ways were also called mathematical learning methods, which could be doing a lot of exercises or spending excessive time studying math. In recent years, more and more Chinese high school students chose to study abroad in America to finish their high school education. These international high school students found that the mathematical learning methods that they developed in China were different from the methods used by American high school students. Many international high school students from China performed well in math exams so that they thought Chinese high school students' mathematical learning methods were better than that of American high school students. In order to understand the difference between the mathematical learning methods used by American and Chinese high school students, I conducted several interviews and read several articles related to mathematical learning methods. 
""I found that Chinese high school students were not creative."" (Personal Interview, 2015) said <name>, one of my interviewees. In China, high school students were assigned by their teachers to do a lot of similarly mathematical exercises every day (Fuligni & Stevenson, 1995, p.834). The aim of doing these exercises was to help students memorize the mathematical knowledge in the books, to develop students' skills of finding answers of mathematical exercises, and to help students respond to mathematical exercises quickly. These kind of mathematical learning methods was called ""Rote Learning"", which meant memorization by repetition. However, this kind of practice would restrict students' creativity. Though students were able to solve mathematical problems at an extremely fast speed, they could only deal with same kinds of exercises that they met before. They could not remain flexible when they were required to apply mathematics to solve problems in other areas such as physics (Wang & Lin, 2005, p.8). Furthermore, Chinese high school students tended to obey the instruction of their teachers and parents instead of thinking by themselves, which exacerbated their situation of losing creativities (Stevenson & Chen, 1995, p.1123-1124). ""I always tried to find several approaches to solve same exercises with my classmates."" (Personal Interview, 2015) <name> said to me when he introduced his favorite mathematical learning method. This kind of learning method, finding several approaches to solve same math problems, could cultivate students' creativity because students needed to use their wits to find solutions instead of copying solutions. Many American high school students also used the same strategies when studying new mathematical knowledge. Therefore, American high school students' mathematical learning methods could cultivate students' creativity. 
However, Cohen (1985) argued that Chinese high school students always performed better than American high school students in math exams. Dillon (2010) supported that Chinese high school students proved their better mathematical learning methods by getting high scores in international math test. But, high scores did not mean that students had a good command of mathematical knowledge because Chinese high school students were trained to get high scores in any tests. Wang and Lin (2005) pointed out that Chinese high school students had high expectation of scores that they got in the math exams. In China, if high school students wanted to be admitted into good university, they were expected to receive high scores in college entrance examination (CEE). Mathematics score made up a large part of total scores of CEE so that students always focused on the score instead of the knowledge that they learned. On the other hand, parents of Chinese high school students always set high standards in math to their children and parents would be angry if their children's math scores fell (Hess, Chang & Mcdevitt, 1987, p.185-186). Due to these factors, it was impossible for Chinese high school students to get low scores in any math exams. What they paid was the incomplete understanding of the mathematical knowledge that they learned. By comparison, American high school students did not focus too much on the scores that they got in math exams. What mattered to them was how to get profound understanding of the knowledge that they learned. ""I always tried to prove the mathematical theories to help me get better understanding to the knowledge that I learned."" (Personal Interview, 2015) Another interviewees, <name>, said to me in the interview. 
Mathematics was important for high school students to learn. Approximate mathematical learning methods could help students learn math well. American high school students' mathematical learning methods focused on cultivating students' creativity and helping students get profound understanding to mathematical knowledge that they learned. Chinese high school students' mathematical learning methods focused on training students the skills of solving similar mathematical exercises and helping students respond to exercises rapidly. Though Chinese high school students could get extremely high scores in math exams, Chinese high school students had a smattering of the mathematical knowledge that they learned and their creativities were restricted (Wang & Lin, 2005, p.10). Therefore, in terms of learning mathematical knowledge, American high school students' mathematical learning methods were better.

"China's easily influenced economy by environment 
From the information I have already collected in my synthesis paper and the interview report, bad environmental situations will influence each and every country's economy in the world. However, I think China is a special country whose economy has the characteristic of being easily influenced by environmental situation. In this paper, I would try to indicate that the reason why China's economy has this characteristic from the perspective of GDP, natural factors and national conditions. 
A large proportion of China's GDP is offset by overdrawing the ecological and environmental resources. In the past twenty years, 	China is one of the highest speed of economic development countries in the world. According to World Bank's research (2000), China's average economic growth rate is 10.3%. Ranked of the second among all the 206 countries and areas in the world. However, the waste of resources, the degeneration of ecology and the pollution of environment have largely offset the reality of GDP. Which means a large proportion of China's real GDP is deducted by the loss of natural capital and ecological deficit even though the nominal GDP is relatively high. The following table provides statistics: 
1985 
1990 
1995 
1999 
Nominal GDP deflator (%) 
33. 48 
37. 95 
43. 13 
42. 63 
Forests deduction (%) 
0. 70 
0. 62 
0. 53 
0. 43 
CO2 deduction (%) 
3. 48 
3. 69 
2. 50 
2. 33 
Natural deduction (%) 
13. 85 
11. 13 
7. 80 
4. 53 
Educational expense rate (%) 
2. 21 
2. 18 
1. 98 
2. 00 
Real GDP deflator (%) 
11. 87 
18. 47 
26. 33 
29. 21 
GDP deflator deduction (%) 
21. 61 
19. 48 
16. 80 
13.42We can see that the environmental factors were causing about 15% deduction of GDP deflator on average. That's a huge proportion of deduction caused by environment, especially for a country like China with such a high GDP base number. Which also means if we can solve these environmental problems, it will bring enormously increase to China's economy. 
Naturally, the cost of development in China is higher than the world's average level due to the congenital fragility of ecological environment. As is cited by Niu (2005), the ability of the form of ecological buffering power and self-purification power in China is much lower than the world's average. That's because of China's special geological situation. In China, more than 65% of the national territorial area is mountains and hills, about 1/3 is arid and semiarid area and 17% is the roof of the world. The area of water and soil loss is about 4 million km2. The average altitude of China is 1. 77 times of the world's average. These natural factors consist of China's fragility of ecological environment. And that means China needs to spend more cost on every economic activities. According to the research from Word Resources (1998), based on the fundamental relationship between Ecological Stress Index, Relief Degree of Land Surface and Regional Development Cost, we can get the Developmental Cost Ratio (China: World's average): 
Livestock husbandry development cost 
1. 03 
Agriculture development cost 
1. 05 
Industry development cost 
1. 25 
Mining industry development cost 
1. 30 
Infrastructure construction cost 
1. 35 
Natural protection cost 
1. 25 
Erosion control cost 
1. 40 
Natural disaster frequency 
1. 18 
Ecology recovery cost 
1.25These numbers demonstrate that due to the existed geological environment, China needs to pay more money compared to the world's average on each and every economic activities. That also explains why China's economy is more easily to be influenced by the environmental situation. 
Besides, the basic national conditions also make China's economy more ""sensitive"" to the environment. China now is one of the biggest developing countries in the world and one of the most polluted countries as well. As is cited by Macbean (2007), a study on China's environment problems and policies, environmental degradation in China was costing the economy eight per cent annually, mostly due to the air and water pollution. The figure would be greatly increased if the costs of deforestation, droughts and floods were added. The pollution situation in China is becoming out-of-control nowadays. However, the Chinese government is also facing with many other urgent issues which can be seen in all developing countries. According to my interviewee, Mr. <name> from Purdue University, ""The negative influence of environment can be amplified because the insufficient protection input."" The governmental funds are being used for some much more urgent issues like poverty and education. Moreover, with less money put on the environmental protection, the environmental situations of the China are easily tend to become worse. 
In conclusion, due to the GDP proportion, existed natural situation and basic national conditions, China is a country which is more easily influenced by environmental situations. As a suggestion, I think China should try to make the economic transition as soon as possible. Move the high resource consumption and waste businesses into environmental-friendly or environmental protection businesses, which will keep the number of jobs, reduce the pollution also the proportion of environmental deduction in GDP.

"Food Social Safety Nets: a good way of solving food security problems 
In developing countries 
Claim/Argument: in order to build and improve a food social safety nets, developing countries' governments need to pay a lot of money and attentions. They have to request money and food aid from international organizations even UN because of the national money lacking. However, a completed food social safety net can really solve food security problems in developing countries. 
I. People in developing countries get benefits from food social safety nets. 
a. Poor people can get enough food with the help the money from food social safety nets 
b. People can get healthier food. 
c. The price of food can be controlled and can avoid the ridiculous food price rising. 
II. Some people think that the food social safety nets are not useful. 
a. Because of the serious corruption situation in developing counties, money for food social safety nets cannot totally used for solving food security problems for people. 
b. After so many years running food social safety nets, the food security problems in developing countries did not change apparently. 
c. Without making good plans and rules for food social safety nets by considering the current situation, even those developing countries can get a lot of supports from international organizations, the food security condition still cannot change. 
III. Building food social safety nets can make multiple benefits to developing countries. 
a. With the social safety nets, the aids and food donates can be well organized and effectively distribute. 
b. Building connections between social safety nets (developing countries) and international organizations (like UN) can let organizations know the food insecurity situations in those developing countries better, then organizations can help with more specific targets in order to solve the different food problems in different developing countries. 
c. Solving food problems are not only the responsibility for governments but also what citizens should pay attention. Food social safety nets are the backup insurance for people, which can also encourage people trying their best to solve food problems. 
IV. The points said food safety nets are not useful didn't make sense. 
a. The corruption problems are big problems in developing countries and it really make food social safety nets lost a lot of money. However, there are still a lot of money can be used to solve food insecurity problems. 
b. Food insecurity problems are not some problems which can be easily solved, it always combined with human civilizations, especially poor developing countries. A very small progress in food security is a huge success for the food social safety nets. 
c. Different countries have different situation for food insecurity problems, making plans and rules are definitely not an easy work to do. Governments need to considering history food insecurity problems and and current condition. Only with a lot of experiments, even failures, the good plan for the food social safety nets can be found. 
V. Examples shows that food social safety nets are good way of solving food security problems in developing countries. 
a. In Mongolia, government use 9 million US dollars to design and start the food stamp program, and another 3 million US dollars were used to improve the program. With these money, at least 100 thousand poor families can get healthier and nutritious food. 
b. The world bank approved a 13 million US dollars' program in order to help the food and agriculture safety net in Cambodia(Mohamad). 
c. China used billions of dollars for building the food social safety nets, and works well.

"Is Speech Recognition the next big thing? / Draft 3 
Friday, April 22, 2016 
'Intelligent Voice Recognition Systems' - the next big step towards an intelligent society 
Introduction 
	Innovation has always been the key to mankind's evolution. Throughout ages innovators have aimed at developing technologies to better human lives. The calculator marked the first big step from the previous century into the current technological era. An innovation brings about an entire revolution into a person's lifestyle. So in this present age, which technology will take us further in scientific advancements? Will it be self driven cars, drones, nanotechnology or Artificial Intelligence in the area of Voice recognition? Voice recognition systems have proved to be very useful and beneficial in the present age in every aspect of science, and thus I believe that Voice recognition holds the key to the next big technology. A lot of research, effort and money goes into the development of a technology. Scientists and Engineers have to work day and night to convert an idea into an innovation. Millions of dollars are spent in the research and creation of a technology. Thus it becomes important for us to discuss this issue at hand so that we invest our money and time in the most fruitful direction. 
But before we go ahead, let us understand how voice recognition works. Like every other technology, speech recognition is also inspired by how the human body comprehends speech. According to an article published by David Basulto in the Washington post as of October 2015, A voice interpreter absorbs phones which are waves of energy created through a noise source and converts it into machine language. Once the signals are converted into compliable machine instructions, the interpreter compares the input with it's pre loaded memory of basic communication analogs and performs the required instructions. SIRI, Google voice are advanced voice interpreters which work on the same principle. All these voice interpreters are commonly refereed to as ASR'S (Automatic Speech recognition systems). 
Argument 
ASR's have the capability to provide a bridge between technology and social problems. All the sophisticated technologies that we use have never been very useful for solving social issues. Voice recognition will be able to solve lot of problems related to communication gaps and security. ASR can prove to be very beneficial especially for the blind people. Speech recognition will allow personal expression for the visually impaired through dictation. It will also give them the power to carry out computer applicable tasks just by communicating with the machine. With the evolution of the ASR headset, blind people will always have an intelligent software supporting them in whatever they do and wherever they go. In his article 'The future of Voice Activated Al sounds awesome', Tracy Tuttle Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at San Diego Mesa college talks about the same concept and specified that voice interpreters will have a massive role in improving the lifestyle of the visually impaired people. 
Currently scientists are working on creating a universal voice translator that has the capability to convert any language into machine language and thus with the evolution of multi-language voice processors, speech translators will become widespread. This translator will bring about a revolutionary approach in solving communication gaps. People who speak different languages will be able to understand each other using this technology. This will also help in removing the language barrier across the globe and thus will bring humans closer to each other. 
Security has always been an issue for the technological industry. Voice recognition can also play a major role in improving privacy issues. In a research thesis published by Richard Lawrence, a professor at the University of Maryland, Richard explained that using complex speech recognition algorithms, a machine can and will be able to differentiate between two voices. Since no two people can produce the same sound, ASR's can be used in security to help maintain a person's identity. This application of ASR's systems is already benefitting several technological firms to prevent identity thefts. 
Above all, ASR technology provides us the freedom of combination. Freedom of combination here refers to the ease and potential that a technology offers for it's combined use with other technologies. Voice recognition can be used along any technology to improve its accessibility and efficiency. As of now, voice recognition is only used in smartphones and smart televisions. But we have only experienced the tip of the iceberg in term's of ASR's full potential. Later in the future, Voice recognizers have the capability to be used with any device or software effectively. It has seen amazing technological advancement in the past years and even now it is growing at a phenomenal rate. Due to this aspect, ASR systems have a huge application in the future. ASR's will soon be ubiquitous - used across the world in every household. Voice will become the primary source of our interaction with things. All the technology that we use in our day to day life will become accessible by communication. With more and more advancements in voice recognition software, we will be able to save tons of money and time by improving the efficiency of the present age machines. 	 
We have seen several advancements and research innovations in this present era. A lot of technologies such as Self driven cars, 3D printers, Drones surround us today in our day to day lives. These technologies also have a huge application in the near future. But, none of these promising technologies aim at solving a problem in the society. They are high tech instruments that will never prove to be very useful for the common public. They may appear as a more fascinating technology, but their use is specific to their domain and cannot be combined with any other technology for bettering human lives. Not just that, these technologies also do not offer any 
The most important factor in considering the growth of a technology is to understand the investment it requires. ASR's and voice recognition software's are very affordable technologies. According to a statistics released by the Washington post, installing a new voice interpreter in a machine costs as low as $39.87. The creation of technologies such as drones, robots, 3D printers and anything under nanotechnology takes thousands of dollars and can only be manufactured by tech giants such as google, apple etc. In another statistic released by Tech Crunch (an online trustworthy technology website) the production of gadgets such as smart watches, 3D printers, self driven cars, drones require excess use of natural resources. ASR is a software and requires minimal amount of resources for it's production. All these factors make ASR a reasonable and eco-friendly technology. 
Conclusion 
All the above mentioned factors add up to create one large picture about the benefits of Voice recognition software's. In the interview with graduate student <Name> who works closely in the area of artificial intelligence, He explained that voice recognition has seen remarkable developments in solving issues related to security, machine efficiency and artificial intelligence in the last decade and it still has a long way to go. Modern age technology is swarmed with voice interpreters and the use of speech recognition. According to a research published by Tech Crunch, related to the use of technological gadgets in a person's day to day life, speech recognition was the most popular software used by almost 44% of the sample space. Companies such as Amazon, Google, Apple have already invested millions of dollars to sponsor research in the area of ASR systems. The great scientist Stephen Hawkins was quoted as saying that success in creating Artificial Intelligence would be the biggest event in human history. Due to it's numerous benefits and it's ease of access, Voice recognition system will be the next big step towards an intelligent society. A society where machines and intelligent systems work together with mankind to help uplift the living standards of an average human household.

"The relationship between TOFEL and academic success 
Why most of the universities in United Stated required international students to provide their TOEFL score for application? Is this score means everything for a student? Such kinds of questions boarded me a lot when I was preparing to study abroad. As an international student I know how hard it is for us to get a high grade in TOEFL, so when I heard that the minimum requirement for most of the universities in United Stated had increased I seriously shocked and I want to know the reasons. And after I searched the Internet and made an interview with the director in Purdue admission office, I found out the reason: TOEFL score is actually somehow positive related with students' academic behaviors. 
Based on the resource that I found before, I support that TOFEL score has non-ignorable relationship to academic success. The TOEFL score requirement for international students at most universities using specific TOEFL score are to determine student eligibility. Also, College and universities generally set their own TOEFL scores that denote a student's eligibility for admission; in general, these vary between undergraduate and graduate programs. In fact, after all the research scholars had done, they do found out that there was significant correlation between TOEFL scores and GPA, course completion, and retention rates and other academic behavior. In addition, according to the article Relationship between TOEFL score and academic success for international engineering students, this research did a lot of methodological data collection, also including data analysis. So the result is based on the data calculation. The researcher did a lot of survey to find out the difference between the ""university overall GPA"" and the ""engineering student GPA"". Also some of other college students like college of business and college of arts & science. Although the relationship between TOFEL and ""engineering student GPA"" is smaller than we thought, the major that needs writing or speaking skills, is tightly related to TOFEL. Moreover, the GPA of students of college of business and college of Art & Science are quit relatively with TOFEL. 
A Canadian Psychological Association compared the academic behavior of students who have different TOFEL score. It shows that students with higher TOFEL scores perform better in academic. I really agree with this statement. TOFEL score can be evaluate the applicants' English ability. There is an example of my friends, Alice and Jim. Their major is communication which needs students have higher speaking and writing skills than others. Alice gained an A in com114's course and could understand other courses' contents easily, because her speaking and listening grade of TOEFL are 28 and 27. Such high grades shows that she is able to speak and listen without barrier. On the other hand, Jim worked hard and final gained 21 and 19 in speaking and listening. Although he reached the minimum requirement of TOEFL in Purdue, he is still difficult to understand what his professor saying. Listening section in TOEFL is similar to real universities' courses, so such a simulation can greatly test the students' abilities to understand the courses. Moreover, the speaking section is related about topics of daily life and opinions of academic knowledge. Jim could not express his view clearly when he was taking TOEFL test. It is normal that he cannot communicate with others or perform well in his communication course. In conclusion, their TOEFL scores tightly connect with academic behaviors. 
In summary, no matter the information I found on newspaper, website, and interview, the TOEFL score has tiny relationship with students' academic behavior in university. The reason why university require TOEFL score is to make sure international has basic English abilities to understand when they are taking classes and finishing homework. The reason for increasing TOEFL score is the increasing number of international students, so universities need to find a way to choose their students. Actually not the TOELF requirement increased. There are many requirements like essay also increased, but they are just not so obvious like ""score"" increased. Nevertheless, a student with higher TOEFL will definitely feel easier when they get into university, even though the advantage is not evident.

Jeremy Lin advance Asians in his own way 
Three years ago, Asian basketball player Jeremy Lin led a ""Linsanity Time"" across the whole USA. He attracted the spotlight all over the world by his unbelievable performance in NBA. Lin was nobody, but after two weeks, he was known everywhere because he[ZH1] led his underdog team into the playoffs. Nevertheless, a lot of opponent objected to Lin by stating that Lin achieved vitally insignificant achievement with outrageous fortune. As a matter of fact, beyond[ZH2] his impact on his team-the New York Knicks.[ZH3] Lin also help the whole American Asian advance in this modern society. 
One can never over-emphasize the influence of Jeremy Lin on American Asians. To begin with, Lin's success in athletics broke the main stereotype that Asian males are athletically awkward, and not being masculine enough. However, a lot of critics (Matt Vella 2012) argued that Lin has never been excellent in basketball, what he did is only a short eruption and he will fade away as soon as possible . Any player can peak and play well in one or two games and then decline, especially the Asian players. (Dat_balla 2014). In their mind, the emaciated Asian player cannot gain any advantage in the highest level of sports associations which are never less than physically intense. Nevertheless, Lin utilized his flexibility and unstoppable speed impressed most of individuals. No matter how hard the defense the rival imposed on Lin, Lin always had his way to score. Lin demonstrated the view that there were numerous athletic talents in Asian community by action. Except for Lin, Yao Ming, Ichiro, Hideki Matsui, Manny Pacquiao also achieved great feat in sports and they became more famous after Lin appeared. However, until that time, most of Asians had still tied up with the impression that Asians are nerds.. Lin But Jeremy Lin not only achieved academic success that he graduated from Harvard University with average GPA 3. 51 in Economics but also obtained high techniques in basketball.( ALISON SCHWARTZ 2012) Gradually, Lin represented American Asian students of the new age, becoming versatile in both sports and academy. The fact is that the impression about the Asians are changing. 
What's more, Lin's growing experience became a great reference when Asian parents try to develop their children. According to the interview set by CNN, Lin mentioned that when he was young, his parents always encouraged him to play sports for fun after he finished his homework, which cause a lot of criticism from other parents. In other Asian parents' eyes, their children must be successful, so they pour too much pressure on their children. From the time when children's age is 5, the Asian parents forced them to learn piano, ballet and martial arts. Asian Parents don't allow their children to have their own childhood, and parents will try their best to fill all kinds of learning tasks into their children's schedule. On the contrary, Lin's parents are really ""weird"". According to CNN, they not only ""indulged"" Lin to play outside, but also even played with him. When Lin's parents found Jeremy Lin was keen on basketball, they even organized games in their community to let their child practice. There is no denying that traditional and common educational mode of Asian parents cultivated a lot of high-score students, but to be honest, the children are extremely lack of emotional quotient, communication skill and even independence. In other words, some of the Asian children fostered by the traditional educational mode are useless to the society except for getting high scores in exams. In addition, the high pressure the Asian parents press on their children causes the suicide rate for young Asians from 15 to 16 years old to increase. ( Heron, M. 2011) [ZH5]According to the report provided by American Psychological Association, the suicide rate for young Asians rose from 13.5% to 15.7% in recent five years. The two main factors attributed to the suicide are mental illness and social factors. As far as I am concerned, the presence of depressive and anxiety disorders usually came from the pressure the Asian parents impose on their children[ZH6]. Due to absence of social activities before, Asian students easily suffer from social failure than other native-born students. However, Jeremy Lin parent rarely pushed Lin so much, what they did was that just letting Lin follow his heart to play basketballs. By force of playing basketball, Lin not only improved his basketball skill but also enhance his leadership and team spirit. Nowadays Lin's success in both academy and athleticism render ever-more Asian parents to give up the outdated educational mode and to adopt Lin's parents' American style educational mode. 
A lot of people thought Jeremy Lin's impact was limited and decreasing. Once Jeremy Lin fell from grace, he would receive ridicules and disappear soon. However, ""Linsanity"" was not an occasional incident. On the contrary, it embodied a fact that Asian community desired for attention. There is no doubt that Asians contributed a lot to United States, but they haven't receive something they deserved in return. So Asian groups are taken in the embarrassing position: They got a really large number of population, but they didn't possess corresponding speaking power. Consequently, avid for attention, when Jeremy Lin performed well in NBA, American Asians advocated Lin crazily so that they put Jeremy Lin at the center of the spotlight. Meanwhile, the Asians groups behind by Lin received attentions too. In this way, a lot of public will of Asians community could surface, and then US government may pay more attention to that, which improve Asian group. In this situation, Jeremy Lin acted as a representative of Asian groups who chased for ""American dream"" and functioned as a bridge between American Asians and public. In fact, Jeremy Lin unconsciously elevated the whole American Asians' status. 
Once Asians gain their own speaking power, Asian community will boom in a short time. Under this background, there must be enormous Asian elites swarming into all kinds of fields, which will prosper the economy of the global community in great possibility. Therefore, Lin's impact, far exceeding that on the basketball courts, had a profound meaning to advancement of Asians. Without Lin's appearance, Asian may stay in the embarrassing position for at least 10 years. From Bruce Lee to Jeremy Lin, we had waited for too long.

Analysis of the wireless power transfer system 
Introduction 
	Between 1885 and 1888, a great talent Nikola Tesla invented inductive motor which opened a revolution to the modern mechanic industry and led human into a more civilized electrical world. (David & Bunn, pg. 15) Tesla then invented another great invention: wireless power transfer system but no one accepted this system and turn it into an application. However, wireless power transfer is a more efficient way to conduct electricity than conduct electricity through wires. Like its name, wireless power transfer technology does not require wires to transmit electricity, it works simply. For a wireless transfer system, it has an inceptor and a receptor, the inceptor utilizes an inductor coil which can generate electricity electromagnetically, and receptor uses another coil plate to accept the electricity. (Choudhary, Singh, Kuma, et al pg. 205) It's like the signal transmission. 
However, the value of this technology is highly ignored by the modern industry. In this paper, I will analyze the wireless power from different aspects, compare with the modern power transmission, and prove my opinion: wireless power transfer is a more effective and efficient solution to the modern power supply system which utilizes the wires as the main media to transmit electricity. 
Background 
	Key concepts: 
	It's important to understand a few concepts to have a better understanding the value of wireless power transfer system. First, wireless power transfer system utilizes the resonance, which means the system vibrating and oscillating with an increasing amplitude. A resonant wireless power transmission system has a primary coil(inceptor) and a secondary coil on target product(receiver). In wireless power transmission system, electricity conduct through the electromagnetic wave between the inceptors and receivers and keep oscillating. 
Safety of the wireless power transmission 
	The first reason that why the wireless power transmission is the concern of the safety of the wireless power transmission. According to Beasley Ryan, a senior graduate student in ECE at Purdue University and the chair leader of ECESS, said: ""People are very scared of it."" Perhaps because these systems can efficiently exchange energy over mid-range distances, people may assume that they are being exposed to large and potentially dangerous electromagnetic fields when using these systems. 
However, this is not the case. Wireless power transfer technology does not transfer electricity in the air, and the electromagnetic field is not harmful to human body. According to the experiments which conducted by Witricity Co., a cooperation first found by the scholars of MIT focus on the wireless power transfer technology, when human stand near the vehicle being wirelessly charged at 3. 3 k W and expose the human tissue in the electromagnetic field, the absorption rate of the human body is nearly negligible. Thus, the wireless power transfer technology is totally safe for human. And according to Wi Tricity Co., wireless power transfer technology ""make devices safer by eliminating the sparking hazard associated with conductive interconnections."" Which means because of the wireless property of this technology, people do not need to plug wires, and eliminate the possibility of dangerous electric shock compare to the modern power transfer system. Therefore, wireless power is completely safe for human safe consideration. 
Efficiency of the wireless power transmission 
	People always concern about safety first; next people always want to know how they work better than the existed products. Because wireless power transmission does not conduct electricity through wires, and it works like signal transmission, people may assume that there will be a huge dissipation when using wireless power transmission system. Will there be any dissipation during the process? The answer is clearly no. Because the transmission is always conducting between the inceptor and receptor, the electricity will only be transmitted in the tunnel between them, and eliminate the dissipation. Depends on the usage of the wireless power transmission, wireless power transfer system is more efficient than the power transfer by wires. ""In high power applications, such as charging of plug-in hybrid vehicles, end-to-end efficiencies (AC input to DC output) greater than 90% have been demonstrated."" According to Wi Tricity Co. Because the resonance between the primary coil and secondary coil, the increment of the amplitude will increase the rate of the products receive the power, and make the charging process more efficient. In another research, according to the scientists in AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), this technology can ""fully lighting up a 60-W light bulb from distances more than 2 m away"". 
Other restriction of the efficiency of the wireless power transfer system also includes distance, in other words, space restrictions. When wireless power transmission does not need to meet the specific space requirements, researchers can easily build a resonant coil to transmit a 60watt light bulb over 2 meters. (Choudhary, Sing, et al pg. 208) Usually, residents use their wireless power transmission in a mid-range distance between the inceptor and receptor in houses, there will be no necessary obstacles which block the resonance. Of course, there are tradeoffs "".incorporating resonators into them generally involves some tradeoffs in resonator size and system efficiency to accommodate the space restrictions"" according to Wi Tricity. This situation may occur when space is complicated. However, in general, the efficiency of the wireless power transmission is enough for the daily usage in residential living and it performs better than the modern power transmission system. 
Technology benefits 
	Nowadays, the conductive wire is still a main solution to the power transfer system. And wires are actual products, they are profitable to the power industry. Compare with the power transfer system by wires, wireless power transfer technology may lack applications and profits. And because of this reason, the development of wireless power transfer is keeping a slow pace compares to other research or industrial manufacture. ""Businessmen do not like this technology because they think if this technology gets developed, wires will have no market anymore, they will lose their fortune from the wire industry."" (Ryan, 3/10/2016.) However, wireless power transfer system can be applied in other fields instead of only the wire industry. Wireless power transfer has the potential value in medication, new wireless chargeable products like smartphones or vehicles, wireless chargeable batteries, wireless housing lighting system, wireless chargeable remote unmanned airplanes/drones. (Wi Tricity Co.) Now the wireless products begin to show in our consumer market, like Samsung Galaxy S6, it has the wirelessly chargeable pad which enables the cellphone to recharge the battery wirelessly. In 1980, Canada's Communications Research Centre built an unmanned airplane called SHARP which can run off batteries, the power is provided from earth. The effective range the SHARP could fly in circles two kilometers in diameter at an altitude of about 13 miles. (Choudhary, Singh et al pg. 207). In Japan, scientists hope to bring this technology to the everyday transportation system, including the hybrid vehicle with wirelessly rechargeable battery, wirelessly controlled bus system stop. (Hori, pg. 2) Therefore, wireless power transfer system has huge potential value in the modern market, and it will change our life in the future. 
Conclusion 
Above, I mainly discussed the wireless power transfer system from its safety, efficiency, and its value and benefits. In conclusion, wireless power transfer technology is not harmful to human and it is very efficient, and it has a hugely valuable technology benefits for our daily life. Although there are some limits of the technology, but it is better than our modern power transfer system. Thanks to the electrical engineering giant Nikola Tesla, we have entered the electric era, maybe he will lead us into another era again with his great invention.

"Affect of smartphones on people: Do they make us smart or dumb? 
Purdue University 
04/10/2015 
""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."" 
-Albert Einstein 
The above-mentioned words said by Albert Einstein fits today's scenario perfectly. Nowadays, the technology is growing at a faster pace than ever before. Every other day we have a new device hitting the market. One question that arises in everyone's mind is how this advancement in technology affects one's intelligence, does it make people dumber or smarter! 
	My interest in this field comes from the fact that I am majoring in computer science at Purdue University and want to be a software engineer in future. For me the questions - How are smartphones affecting people? Are they making us dumb or smart? - matter a lot. In particular, I want to know how the people are adopting to the ever-growing market of smartphones. In today's world a man and a smartphone hold a very strong relationship. A smartphone is one of those items that are close to a person. Smartphones remember every piece of information for you from a person's mobile number, birthday to driving directions to a place. To paraphrase the late George Carlin, they are the digital equivalent of ""the place to put our stuff."" 
	Smartphones have become so ingrained in our lives that it is impossible for many of us to spend a single day without them. We all love are smartphones, but we all fear that these digital devices are affecting us negatively. Research shows that our intuition is wrong (Daniel, 2015). The reliance on mobile technology is increasing. According to a research conducted by a firm, smartphones cannot stop us from focusing, but our sense that we cannot may not be a phantom. Smartphones sniff out our desire to think. We have become so used to fast access to any sort of information (thanks to the Internet!) that we do not want to even ponder or think about it for a second. Our 'dependence on smartphones' and 'social networking (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)' when combined makes an irresistible cocktail. A cocktail in which there are incentives for constant participation or sharing of information, as well as incessant information ""snacking"". 
	The argument I want to make is that, despite of some drawbacks of the smartphone use, smartphones hold a bright future. They mostly affect our lives in a positive manner. They are our key to the futuristic world. According to a research conducted by Pew Research Center, 80 % of those surveyed agreed to the fact that they use the Internet at least once a week to keep up with developments in their profession and 72 % of this information is found using smartphones (Pew Research Center, 2012). Today's technology is highly customizable - smartphones provide us with information the way we want. Moreover, these digital devices boost our memorizing power too. They help free up memory we would normally use for mundane information, so we can use it for other tasks. 
	According to Daniel T. Willingham, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, digital devices are not eating our brains, or shortening our attention spans. According to the research mentioned in The New York Times, scientists use ""span"" to mean two separate things: how much information our mind can retain, and how well we can maintain focus. They measured the former by asking people to repeat long strings of numbers in reverse order. They measured the latter by asking people to look at a visual and monitor occasional and subtle changes. Performance on the tests looked as good as it did 50 years ago. So, we can conclude that smartphones are not responsible for any effects on our focusing power, or it is not smartphones that are shortening our attention spans.

"Social Skills Regain 
""Culture is the whole complex of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features that characterizes a society or a group. It includes creative expressions, community practices and material or built forms."" (Serageldin, 1996) Every culture is charming because of their unique and irreplaceable perceptive of the world and ways of doing things. These lead us to different life schemas and social skills, which further lead to culture shock when people live in another culture. Small life hassles can be amplified into big trouble, and might bring misunderstandings among people. People in America would say ""how are you"" to almost everyone when greeting people, but people in China wouldn't do that unless knowing each other very well, and won't ask back. We might generate an unfriendly-like behavior in greeting in Chinese way. In that, social skills need to be regained during adaption to another culture, and it's the most effective way to smoothly transit to a new life style to behave in a more local way. 
Social skill is the exterior form of a culture, and also is the most basic part of a culture. A series of skills forms a cultural schema stored in our brain, based on which we have common sense on social activities (Nishida, 1999). When people talk about culture, they always focus on how people behave under specific circumstances. Although it seems easy to understand differences when talking about culture shock, but when it comes to reality, you will realize how deep the social skill schema of our own culture is imprinted in your thoughts and behaviors, and it is really hard to change just by knowing the differences. That is why people should regain social skills to get through culture shock. 
Regaining local social skills is the most efficient way to conquer culture shock. First, it helps people know local social schema to fit in new environment, which gives you chance to be more involved and successful in both life and career; second, it can lessen stress and improve both physical and mental health; third, it is easy to achieve and practice, because social skills can be gained by doing little daily hassles in different situations; forth, through gaining local social skills, people can experience the spirit of the host culture, and might eventually appreciate them by doing customs as a habit. These points make regaining social skills a strong method of conquering culture shock, which will be further discussed in following paragraphs. 
Regaining local social skills can help you be ""normally-behaved"" for fitting in, which is the first and the most significant step of conquering culture shock. Being normally-behaved gives us more chances to well impress others, which helps build friendship with local people, more fit in host culture, and then more successful in career. It seems impossible having a good image when you were misunderstood rude due to a not fitting behavior, not to mention building a friendship. Even though you are really good at something, you will still be thought of weird if don't normally behave. Good feelings of fitting in, which are built by gaining local social skills, gives people courage in other tasks. Other kinds of ways to conquer culture shock somewhat help in normally behaving, but not so effective as regaining social skills, like keeping talk with people can relieve your depressed feelings and help lessen the influence of culture shock on academy, but it doesn't help you improve to be more like a local resident because of no learning and practicing customs. Regaining social skills gives us the tool to change a status of being different, and helps feel good in not being so weird. After that, good impression on others will let you more positive in doing other things, in that forming a good reinforcement of regaining more social skills. 
Regaining social skills lessens people's stress and improves both physical and mental or psychological stress from facing culture shock. Stress originates from change (Nairne, 2014), and no doubtfully, living in another culture is totally a life change, which will generate much stress when differences are obvious. Why gaining social skills can be effective is because it reduces behavior differences by changing yourself to be more local when you cannot change the environment to be the way you like. It is a process of reappraisal of changes: when you are adaptable in different social customs, changes will be no longer felt and will not bother you as a stressor. Without stress, the physical and mental health of people will naturally develop, helping improve other performance in study and career. 
Another point of effectiveness of regaining social skills to conquer culture shock is that they can be easily learnt through daily life dialogue with different people, and of course it is no harder than getting an insight of a culture. Jot down how people behave, use it for next time, then a skill formed. Social skills are on the surface of a culture, which you can get whenever you take a notice on little things. The control is in hand, not like consult, a counselor is needed. You can go different places to try your new schema of social activities, and notice how people respond and do the same thing for the next time. 
However, this kind of training might be inadequate to break down culture shock, and it might not get you fully accept new customs. It is somewhat the truth if you only see social skills only as surface things of a culture. However, culture spirits are exactly lying in little things like daily greeting. Like the ""how are you"" story mentioned above, we get the idea that people in America like to show care when they meet new friends, and it is also important to show your concern for others to ask back. Maybe people still cannot agree with this custom and cannot show true care to people, but at least doing the same thing with local friends makes you fit in and be welcomed by others, which probably will let you feel good in gaining that social skill. It is not hard to predict that with time going, the skills will become your habits and you will accept the idea that it is good and warm to care others. Finally, people really feel good in doing local customs, form a local perception in how social activities should work, and then culture shock gradually diminishes. 
Regaining social skills is easy to achieve and help you in behaving normally for fitting in. By doing that, stress will be lessened and courage will be gained, which helps both physical and mental health leading to further success of study and life. Even though it is considered as the most surface part of a culture, little social skills indicate inner spirits of culture, like how people perceive friendship in greeting people. Good image of self can be formed by doing what others do, which leads to a welcomed reaction of people, good feeling of fitting in, and courage in doing other things. As for a method of conquering culture shock, regaining social skills is the most effective way.

Budget Cuts: War on Education
Education is important; this is almost an irrefutable fact. Regardless of what career or vocation one chooses in life, the skills learned in school can be useful. Public schools are where most Americans receive their basic K-12 education. Education should be high on any state's priorities as it can help to improve communities by increasing the general knowledge and skills of the people. However, Arizona's state legislature recently proposed over 900 million dollars in budget cuts from K-12 and higher education. Although action must be taken to ease Arizona's deficit, these cuts cause major problems in both the immediate and distant future and should not be placed on the shoulders of education.
Before looking at the problems these cuts may cause, one must first understand what exactly they entail. Currently, the United States is in an economic recession which is leading many people to take drastic financial measures. The educational budget cuts in Arizona are in reaction to the trying times the country is currently facing. No one can blame the legislature for attempting to dig its way out of the deficit it has fallen into. However, there needs to be a better method. How can such a large amount of money being taken from the education fund be the best solution? Could the money not be taken from various other areas and thus lessen the load that education must bare? The answer is yes. If the legislation would reduce the cuts to education and increase cuts to other areas of the budget, such as prisons and other such facilities it would alleviate some of the stress being put on education. It would initially affect more people but to a lesser degree. If the debt is shared by many different departments, each department won't have to lose as much funding. Many groups such as the Arizona Education Association (AEA) believe that the legislature's decision is a turn for the worse based on exaggerated information regarding the percentage of the budget that education uses. To put it plainly, they manipulated the statistics to influence the opinions of the legislature.
The AEA has been one of the leading opponents of the education budget cuts since the beginning. They have put out informative research and hosted public demonstrations to help voice their opposition. Much of this research has been focused on the information presented by the proponents of the cuts to support them. In their reports, the state's Republican Party shows the increase in public education spending since 1986-87, but does not account for the rise in population in Arizona. If they had taken into account population and inflation, their reports would show that Arizona actually spent less per student in 87-89 than it did in the 07-08 school year (AEA). It seems as though the proponents are trying to throw out numbers that might scare or confuse people into agreeing with them. Education is expensive, but it is extremely vital to the future of Arizona as well as any state. In a struggling economy, these cuts add to the turmoil and uncertainty people face every day.
Arizona's proposed budget cuts are causing some very immediate problems for many people, especially teachers. One of the major issues many teachers face is the uncertainty of continued employment this coming fall. Many schools are being forced to cut much of their faculty and as most schools have not yet made definitive choices, many employees are left to worry. Teachers in Arizona have never appeared to be the top priorities when the budget is concerned and have low average salaries compared to the national average (ATF). On top of everything else, teachers now have lost their job security. The deadline for informing these teachers of their job standing is set in April. This gives the teachers very little time to find new employment. Educators and other faculty that remain will face hard times as well. With such large cuts, many departments that require special equipment will be hurt from the tight budget. Science equipment, sports gear, projectors, and books are all eligible to be cut. With employment being so scarce in Arizona what will the teachers without jobs do? It is possible that they will leave the state in search of other opportunities. The state legislature does not realize that quality teachers are a precious resource. By giving them reason to leave Arizona will lose that resource. With these types of layoffs happening, what reasons do new teachers have to stay? The Arizona State Legislature is driving current and future teachers out. Who pays for this? Students and the rest of the state. With fewer teachers, class sizes will increase. Teachers will have even more students to per class, meaning that they will not be able to give as much individual help. This could lead to many students getting left behind.
These cuts do not just affect K-12 schools alone, universities such as Northern Arizona University (NAU) will also face some uncertainty come fall. This coming year, the average in state student's total estimated cost for attending NAU will increase roughly 2,000 dollars from last year's cost (NAU Fin Aid 1). This is due to new student fees proposed to combat the 20 million dollars that will be cut from NAU's budget (Haeger 1). This not only effects current and future students but faculty and programs in departments of all kinds. As a science education major at NAU, this makes me worry about next semester and my career. What state will Arizona's education system be in five years from now and how might these cuts effect it?
If the cuts do not help the state's deficit as hoped, many more problems will come about in time. If more cuts are required, the quality of Arizona's public education will drop severely into an even worse condition. If the quality of available education drops, state standards will be lowered as well. Because tests like the SATs do not vary by state, Arizona students might fail to measure up to national averages. This could lead to less federal funding for education which would further disrupt schools' ability to provide an adequate education (as seen in Chart# 1 below).
Chart #1
A lack of teachers may also result from low salaries and poor working environments that could be caused by the lack of funding. If the quality of education drops then it is probable that a large number of people will enter the job market without the benefit of a solid education. Also, tuition for higher education will go up in the years to come if the legislature's attitude toward education continues. Their general view on education seems to be that it is just a department they can get money from without any consequences. They could not be further from the truth. All of these are probable outcomes and none are beneficial to Arizona because they will drastically affect the future wellbeing of the state. Why is education taking such a large hit from the legislature? Why is so much of their attention focused on this part of the budget? Why not prisons or other state funded programs? This question remains unanswered by those who endorse this bill.
Other programs need money as well, not just education. While education accounts for a higher percentage of general fund (GF) spending other programs require a

fair amount of funds as well. The legislature could cut some funding from these departments to help the situation. For example The Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) accounts for about 12% of the overall budget could be cut. Even taking just 3% from this department would help decrease the amount taken from education and still leave the ADC with enough funding to run their facilities. Another possible course of action would be for the state to stop giving funding to private schools. Aren't private schools supposed to be just that, privately funded? Why should the state give fundong to these schools if they are not public institutions? This is an unnecessary expenditure and would help reduce the cost of education for the general fund. The United States supreme court seems to agree as it recently denied vouchers proposed by the Arizona Legislature to fund private schools with tax payer's money (AEA).
One cannot help but wonder why the Republican Party is focusing so heavily on the education budget. Some have claimed that it is because education accounts for a large amount of Arizona's overall budget. K-12 education accounts for about 43% of Arizona's general fund distribution (seen in Chart#2)(Az.leg.). This seems to support the Republican Party's justifications for targeting education as opposed to other agencies. It is evident that education costs money, however, is it not worth the cost? Education is a key factor in any state because it is an investment in the future. In order to properly function and be productive within a society, one needs some sort of education be it high school, trade school, or a bachelor's degree. This education requires materials, employees, facilities, and much more to be effective. No one can argue that education is costly; however, no one can argue that the cost is not worth the reward.
To be fair, it is entirely possible that the cuts might help alleviate the Arizona's deficit and the cuts will not have a large effect in the long run. However, is this a gamble the state legislature is willing to take? What are they betting with? In this case, the risk is simply too high, the cuts could last longer than anticipated. Many predict that the recession is coming to an end soon but rumors have been saying that for the last year. The economy seems very unpredictable right now, who can say what the right course of action is; It is one of the responsibilities of the state legislature to protect the rights and interests of the people in Arizona. Does not everyone in Arizona, and the entire United States, deserve the benefit of a solid education? Of course they do, that is how a state builds productive members of society and furthers the success of the state as a whole.
Apparently, the idea of making education a top priority is shared by people as high up as the oval office. Recently, President Barrack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help families and public schools in need. The bill will bring over 2 billion dollars into Arizona for education related spending (AEA). Over 800 million dollars will go to direct assistance for needy schools within Arizona. This will greatly help alleviate pressure on schools from the budget cuts. This shows that the federal attitude toward education is improving with this new administration. It gives a future teacher like me hope to see this kind of action being taken to help Arizona education.
In conclusion, the proposed budget cuts to Arizona's education funding are more of a hindrance than a solution. The entire state will be negatively affected by them in one way or another. Education is part of the foundation of any state's future and should be a priority for those elected officials that are paid to do what is in the best interest for the people they represent. What will it take for the proponents of these bills to realize that Arizona's education is in need of adequate funding? With Arizona currently 49th in the U.S. for education the real question is: How low can we go?

"WOMEN IN COMBAT: YES OR NO? 
Women have shown their strengths in a wide array of fields in the 21st century, including in some the toughest and most dangerous- in the front lines. Although women have been part of the front lines for a centuries allowing women to join the combat units of the army is still a controversial as well as one of the most debated topics the United States Department of Defense DOD has to face. Although a petition was finally passed in 2013 allowing women to join the combat units, there are several major reasons why women should not be allowed to join the combat units of the US army; These include internal conflicts within a squad due to the presence of mixed genders and the difficulty in maintaining the high professional attitude required by these soldiers. 
Trust is the foundation that any squad in the battlefield depends heavily on. Trust that their partner is watching their back while they are clearing a room or an area with possible insurgent activity, trust that they will not abandon you when you need them the most and most importantly trust that they don't shoot you ""accidently"". If this trust is broken then the whole squad falls apart as they are not working as efficiently as possible, and may even end up increasing the casualties rather than decreasing it. With the addition of women into the combat units the dynamic of the squad has to change in order to accommodate their female ""bother in arms"" which can be detrimental to the squad as now they also have to worry about society's male and female interaction criteria amongst other far more important things in a war. Additionally, given any social scenario having mixed genders inevitably leads to relationships being formed between genders and if you people end up liking the same female then there certainly will be internal conflict stemmed from the lack of trust. This issue will be more prevalent when the military hierarchy is at play, in other words the conflict involves higher ranking officer and a lower ranking squad member. Furthermore, in addition to decreasing trust and increasing internal conflict within the squad introduction of women into the combat units will also hinder the professional attitude that needs to be maintained at all times during a war. The presence of mixed genders will tend to make the atmosphere a bit more social which in turn nourishes the notion if forming relationships, which in turn decreases trust and increases internal conflict. 
On the other hand, it is indisputable how valuable the women were during the war in Iraq. During the war intel regarding the enemy's hideout was of top priority buy due to the local culture the women in the village would not talk to the me in the army. Therefore, women were the only way that the army was able to talk to villagers, specifically women, and gather vital intel about the enemy's movements and taken them down. While women's vital role in the war was inarguable, their only role was to collect intel and given the dynamic nature of the war everyone must be adaptable so that they can perform any task that the situation demands. This is due to the fact that human labor, specifically military recruits, is a scarce resource and if the recruits are adaptable it significantly reduces the casualties as the number of people fight would significantly decrease. Moreover, allowing women to join the combat units for the primary reason of gathering intel might not be the best use of this resource. Even more so, given sufficient time the men would have been able to gather the same intel, though the means and the time taken will be different. 
In conclusion, women should not be allowing to join the combat units of the US army it will induce a more social atmosphere which nurtures relationships between the troops causing internal conflicts and eventually causing extremely serious trust issues; all of which inhibits the squad to perform missions at optimal level and may even increase the casualties instead of decreasing it. But it is undebatable how valuable women have been in gather crucial info about the enemy and their movements which lead to US troops winning small battels. Then again it is also important to note that the battlefield is ever changing and so everyone have to be able to do everything should the need arise and allowing women to join the combat units for the main purpose of intel gathering may not be an optimal use of scarce resource- labor.

Using Substitutes for Smoking Cessation 
	One day, I was talking to a friend who is a smoker in a process of quitting, and found her holding a pen-looking object between her fingers and inhaling and exhaling deeply a great volume of smoke without any burning smell. When I asked what the object is, she answered that it is an e-cigarette, which is another type of smoking methods that helps reducing the amount of nicotine intake and leads to smoking cessation. Then, for seconds, I thought it would not be harmful to the body so everyone can smoke without taking health risks. Contrary to my thought, my friend failed to stop smoking but still asserts that smoking substitutes including e-cigarettes are better than smoking regular cigarettes. However, I believe that smokers should not use cigarette substitutes to help smoking cessation because they are only going to harm. 
	One type of smoking that most people think is safe is hookah because they are made with herbs or fruits and filtered through water. But in fact, they are more harmful than smoking cigarettes. ""According to a World Health Organization advisory, a typical one-hour session of hookah smoking exposes the users to 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette"" (""Types of Tobacco,"" n.d.). Smoking hookah will give smokers the worse influence on health. Just like regular cigarettes, they still contain tar, carbon monoxide and are nicotine addictive. Moreover, smokers can share and spread hepatitis, herpes, flu or other contagious diseases from using the same mouth pipe with others (Jain, n.d.). Switching to hookah does not make smokers stop consuming nicotine and other harmful substances and there is also risk of infections. 
	Another type of smoking product that people use in hope to reduce the damage to health and aid smoking cessation is herbal cigarettes. What makes them look healthier than traditional cigarettes is that they are mix of natural products of herbs and tobacco. They may contain less tobacco plants but they deliver nicotine and produce tar, ""one of the main cancer-causing agents of regular cigarettes"" (Jain, n.d.). It is also found to contain the same chemicals as tobacco cigarettes. Even if the cigarettes is completely made out of natural herbs, it will still produce chemicals and tars in the process of burning and inhaling of the smoke in the mouth. Do not ever assume that the product is healthy because it is called natural or herbal. 
	The type of smoking product that is most frequently recognized and used to induce smoking cessation is e-cigarettes. The reason why so many people think that they are better than cigarettes is that they are advertised to be safe to use and aid in quitting smoking. However, this is not true. In terms of safety, inhaling vapor with foreign substance into the lungs can damage mouths and throats in addition to the lungs. There are fears of fire and explosion of the batteries and vapor initiator. Also, just like regular cigarettes, e-cigarettes are used to deliver nicotine, which will still make hard to quit smoking. What makes e-cigarettes worse for smoking cessation is that it mimics the hand-to-mouth motion of regular smoking cigarettes. Therefore, they cannot be used to help quit smoking (Jain, n.d.). 
After all these opinions in mind, a contradicting research is conducted by Siegel, Tanwar and Wood to investigate the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for people trying to cease smoking cigarettes. Through this research it was found that more than half of respondents reported that they reduced nicotine use, and nearly half of them said they have tried quitting smoking for a period of time after trying e-cigarettes. However, there are limitations to this study. The respondents cannot represent all smokers who have tried e-cigarettes and their responses are not entirely trustworthy because there is no biological and chemical proof that they have stopped smoking (Siegel et al, 2011). Also, there are so many other research papers that say that substitutes of tobacco products are not better than typical cigarettes and do not aid in smoking cessation. <Name>, <Position>, claimed that she has seen enough research on hookah and e-cigarettes that they are not at all healthy alternatives (personal communication, March 23, 2015). 
All the different types of smoking products described above have similarities. Just like cigarettes, they all can be addictive with nicotine, contain many harmful chemicals and can actually prevent smokers from quitting because they will make the smokers engage in other smoking behaviors. Therefore, all of them are not good substitutes for cigarettes. Instead of those, exercising, drinking lots of fluids, mediating and relying on nicotine therapy will be the best substitutes for cigarettes.

The Importance of Greed: Why Capitalism Works Best
Capitalism is often seen to be an economic system characterized by greed. The idea of greed being an essential motivator of capitalism does not imply that greed must be defined by its typically negative connotations, but instead characterizes greed as being a desire for success. This desire brings about economic efficiency and improves the standard of living by inspiring innovation and facilitating cooperation to bring products to people for a profit. Consider the wooden pencil for instance. Leonard Read, the founder of the Foundation for Economic Education, described the origins of the wooden pencil in his short story I, Pencil. My Family Tree. (Read 1) He discussed the many materials and separate industries necessary to make pencils. Lumber industry workers must work with manufacturers to supply the wood. Pencil manufacturers must also work with the mining industry so that they may acquire the necessary graphite used to make the lead of the pencil. Construction workers that created and poured the concrete to construct the dam used to power the millions of dollars of manufacturing equipment must also be considered as playing a role in the making of a pencil. From the dust sweepers keeping factory floors clean to the chemists that blended the lacquer used to coat the pencil and mixed the oils used to create the eraser, many people play essential yet infinitesimally small roles in the production of a pencil. What inspires all of these people to work together so seamlessly towards one cause? It is not out of altruism or benevolence that these people work so hard to supply pencils to the world, but rather it is the voracity of their greed that drives them to cooperate. The concept that greed is an underlying factor in the voluntary cooperation of people to create things is the basis of capitalism. It is for this reason that capitalism and its tendency towards facilitating free market economies is an efficient economic ideology.
Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines capitalism as an economic system characterized by private ownership of capital goods and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market economy (Merriam-Webster's). A free market is an economic market characterized by free competition, meaning that the naturally occurring demand of people in relating to the unregulated supply of producers determines the price that goods are bought for and the quantity of goods that are sold. Members of a capitalist society, in their attempts to satisfy their propensity towards accommodating for themselves and their families, are motivated to use their individual skills to work together because it is profitable. They are able to decide for themselves what they want to produce together because Individual freedom facilitates a market economy. In this system, people are completely free to decide how they would like to put their income to use. Since the idea of a perfectly free market economy is merely a model and therefore cannot exist in its purest form as an actual economic system, it is best to view this argument theoretically. It is the economic principles behind this theoretical free market that makes it so effective.

Target audiences of Chinese animation 
Japanese anime is well-known all over the world these years, while Chinese animation cannot perform very well. In previous research, I have gained lots of useful information on this topic. I believe that Chinese animations can improve by imitating Japanese anime. Specifically, I suggest that Chinese animation expands its target audience to a wider range. 
The first reason is that young children cannot really afford the cost of buying a good anime. In an interview with Mr. <name> , he explained: ""Japanese anime targets start from school children all the way to junior high, senior high and even more mature people, such as college students or 30-40-year old audience. On the other hand Chinese animation is more immature than Japanese anime."" Then he added: ""Financial cost of making anime as far as I heard was about 2 million dollars for a 24-episode anime with half year cycle."" From his statement, it is not hard for me to figure out that making an anime cost a lot of money. Therefore I don't believe a huge amount of teenagers have a lot of money and will pay for the expensive animation. Therefore, 15-25-year-old people should be the target audience. 
The second reason is that if the anime studio focus on young children, they already lost potential audiences. In the book, the author of Chinese Animation: A History and Filmography 1922-20121, the author Rolf Giesen talked about the target audience: One of Chinese officials said Chinese animations should target on young children. Then government helped domestic company by keeping the high license fees from foreign studio. From his belief, Chinese animation did ignore some potential audiences. Actually, I have many friends who love watching Japanese anime but Chinese animation. In their mind, they think Chinese animations are too na ve and immature to watch. 
My last reason is that young children in China don't have time to watch anime. In China, from primary school even before all the way to the end of their senior high school, students have to take exam-oriented education. Actually, China has 1. 357 billion citizens and almost all youth have to take exams to the higher education. After they enter the college, however, they have lots of time to relax. As far as I heard, many college students in China don't have to attend their class and what they need is studying for a single week for their final exam. So in China, Chinese animation should not limit the target audience on children, they can probably expand it to college students. 
In fact, many people have their own opinion against me. Some say that China did succeed in the earlier 20th century and the target audience was only child so why they have to change. However, the thing is as simply as their thought. China did succeed in the last century, but it was based on the government's help. China kept high license fees from foreign anime studios during that period and the government used a lot of money on animation without too much return. In addition, the internet was not very popular in the last century. Nowadays, it is easy for us to find some interesting animations instead of limit boring animation. Other people are opposed to my opinion. They believe that children's parents will afford the cost of anime. Indeed, I know many children whose parents are pleasure to buy DVD even Blue-ray disc for them just like my mother. However, based on my observation, rarely parents will buy the genuine DVD instead of pirate DVD in China. Many of DVD sell in China is faker copied by illegal ways. In this situation, the studios cannot get money from their audience, however piracy businesses will. 
In conclusion, I believe Chinese animation studio can improve their products by imitate Japanese anime. And the best way to do that is changing Chinese animation's target audience to much wide range.

"Video Games ""WP#5""
Can you imagine being nine years old playing video games with only one eye? My brother can. My younger brother lost his sight in one eye because he was playing video games all the time facing the TV. After I took my brother to the doctor, he said my brother cannot see from his left eye because my brother was not feeling about his sight is going and he use to play with one eye, also, the doctor said the TV can be a big factor. Most young people these days like to play video games, especially action and violent games. Shin states that ""there have been studies that have found video game violence to have little negative effects on their players, there are also many studies that have found a positive correlation between negative behavior"" (Shin, 2003). Researchers argue about the negative and positive effects of video games on players. This paper comes with a conclusion as to whether or not games are beneficial for children or whether they are completely bad for them. Based on increased violent behavior, negative health effects, devolving anti-social behavior this paper will report that video games are bad for young people.
Sources think video games can cause young players to be violent. Stafford, a researcher at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, conducted a study with 600 young video-game players. As a result, he found that many games are training our kids to ""celebrate violence"" (2007, p. 14). Stafford's study shows how some young players love violent video games and cannot feel happy unless they kill more than 1000 players in the game in one night. When people play these games constantly, say opponents of video games, they can become desensitized to violence or even copy the events that were played out in the video games. Stafford's research says that ""There was even a controversy recently over the online game, Super Columbine Massacre RPG, which allows players to act out the tragic events that took place at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado"" (2007, p. 14). Figure 1 replays how the two males to the school with their guns and shows how close their age are to other young players who play video games. Included in Jefferson county suspicious incident report that:
The friendship grew, with Harris discussing his love for video games like Doom, (which are also played with adult friends,) guns, and his feelings of ostracization at school. At times he detailed creating a diversion before a big attack, and spoke of how when the day came, he was going to make sure he got the chance to shoot certain other students at his school. Assuming that the teen was merely blowing off steam, are chalked Harris's ranting up to adolescent feelings of peer pressure and a vivid imagination, a coping mechanism for his feelings of being outside the rest of his peers. Despite the violence he spoke of, are found Harris to be articulate, intelligent, and entertaining. He credited Harris's interest in guns to video games such as Doom, and felt that Harris was just seeking attention with his vitriol. (Stafford, n.y.)
Therefore, these types of video games can encourage young people to act in this manner and can push those on the verge carrying out this type of violence over the edge. The two males who engineered their hometown's infamy were shooters. They are perhaps two of the most talked about teenagers in recent history, their names and faces stamped in the annals of American crime (Stafford, 2007, p. 14). There have been reports of criminals copying crimes that they watch in the controversial games. The two males feel as if they can act in any way that they choose and that they will never have to answer for the decisions that they have made, which is quite untrue. This can create a serious problem in society, and perhaps if these realist games should exist, then they should have realistic consequences for actions one takes while playing the game. According to those against games, video game players do not actually see the realistic consequences of their actions in these games and can potentially begin to think these actions are acceptable in real life.

2, That gun is a DC9M Semi-Automatic Pistol.
3, This is Eric Harris, he was 18 years old carrying the shotgun with Dylan.
4, That gun is a Springfield shotgun.
5, they were at Columbine High School's Library. (Stafford, n.y.) In addition, some critics believe that video games can be bad for a player's health. Hunsinger is a frequent contributor to Buzzle.com, as online news and information site. He has written on topics such as gardening, health issues and computers. In Hunsinger's essay, he cites Hermosillo, president of the Mexican society of cardiology, who shared the fact that ""up to forty percent of children who constantly play video games will develop high blood pressure"" (2007, p. 14). He argued that video games can be very bad for children and have harmful effects on their health, which can also lead to ""cardiovascular disease, the primary cause of death in Mexico"" (2007, p. 12). This is because players get so wrapped up in the game that they forget their surroundings. They then start to become tense and their body reacts to these emotions, causing increased heart rate, blood pressure and respirations (2007 p. 12). Hunsinger says that high blood pressure can cause game players to act violently.
Furthermore, other critics believe video gaming causes obesity and sedentary behavior. Hunsinger cited a study in Beijing that linked young overweight students to watching too much TV and playing video games (Hunsinger, 2007, p. 14). According to Hunsinger, ""up to 40 percent of children between 5 and 8 years of age are considered to be clinically obese"" (2007, p. 14). Obesity is a health condition in which a person gains too much body fat. Bar-Or is a director of children's nutrition at Chedoke-Mc Master Hospitals in Hamilton, believes that people who get fatter feel more sedentary and do not want to do exercise (Bar-Or, 1993, p. 15). For example, when a person begins to become overweight, he does not have the energy to exercise. This in turn causes the person to gain more weight, and this routine turns into a vicious cycle. When children become overweight and tired then all they want to do is play video games, but because they are tired, it will prove to be difficult for them to take part in physical activity. Due to all these factors, it will be extremely hard for the child to break this habit and lifestyle without the encouragement and support of friends and family. Video games can also make people inactive and sick. According to Bar-Or, ""Obesity among children has increased quite dramatically in the last 20 years"" (Bar-Or, 1993, p. 15). He also believes an inactive child is likely to be an obese adult (1993, p. 15). Gentile, is a directs the Media Research Lab in the psychology department at Iowa State University, where he conducts research on the media's effect on children and adults, states that ""Dozens of psychological studies indicate that playing violent games increases aggressive thoughts, feelings and behaviors"" (Dana, 2009).
In contrast, some sources believe that video games can be helpful. They believe if games are created and utilized in a certain manner, then they can be very beneficial for everyone who participates in them. According to Streisand, a senior writer at U.S. News and World Report, ""video game playing can help heal sick and traumatized patients. Health professionals are prescribing video games to manage pain, chronic diseases, and even post-traumatic stress disorder"" (Streisand, 2006, p. 25). Streisand believes that video games can treat or heal a player's health (Streisand, 2006, p. 25). Although, some medical professionals would state that video games do not actually promote healing of the injury or sickness but rather take the patients mind off of the pain or illness during the healing process. It would prove difficult for any scientific study to prove that playing games could actually lead to a person's healing, but it is not to say that games do not make the healing process more pleasurable. According to O'Hanlon, a freelance writer based in New York, she is the editor and publisher of ACM Queue, ""Guitar Hero helps improve hand-eye coordination and balance it is not easy to stay on that pad"" (O'Hanlon, 2007, p. 21). O'Hanlon stated that this game helps the players use the controller in their hands without looking at it. Also, video games can be a factor to improve the player's skills faster (2007, p. 21). However, researchers show that video games can be beneficial but there are aspects of video games that can affect players adversely. When people spend more time playing video games, they have increase danger of performing poorly in school, becoming overweight or obese, and developing specific negative physical health outcomes. For these reasons, every hour that a child spends on video games is not spent doing homework, reading, or creating in other activities that might have more educational benefit, which prove that video games cannot be helpful all the time (Gentile, 2009). Figure 2, shows the big numbers of people between 2006 to 2011 who buy video games, Anderson states that people are getting crazy about video games and more than 67 percent are violet games.
Figure 2: Video gaming to be twice as big as music by 2011. This is the numbers for total U.S. video game sales in 2002-2006.(Anderson, 2007)
Moreover, sources believe that video games have positive effects on players. According to O'Hanlon, ""video games such as Dance Dance Revolution not only provide healthy aerobic activity for kids, they also boost brain power"" (O'Hanlon, 2007, p. 17). Schools use the dance game for classes at the gym to make the students more interested to go to class and do more physical activity. O'Hanlon said that there are advantages from video games, such as ""increased blood flow"" and more exercise. He said video games help the player lose weight (2007, p. 18). These games should not be a complete substitute for physical activity but does allow the gamer to remain active when he/she plays games. Of course, there are those who play video games daily, and for those people the physically demanding games are a great asset if that is the only physical activity they are getting. Even though, there are games can help the player there are the unskillful games. For example, the violent children who look for playing violent actions games with a group of friends might yield at each other or start fight. People have the power in their body but they do not know where they discharge it. Also, young players can get hurt or hurt other things form trying to do hard activities on video games like the Wii.
Likewise, some sources suggest that video games benefit the classroom. According to Visscher, the managing editor of Ode, an independent monthly magazine about people and ideas that are changing the world, ""Videos games teach creative problem solving and other worthwhile skills by forcing students to formulate, test, and revise hypotheses"" (2007, p. 31). Visscher thinks that video games help the students to create, solve, make and fix an idea. An example of this type of game is 'Sudoku'. These games can help increase problem solving and logic skills. These games require a person to understand a concept and to create a solution for a problem and allow them to reason. These more advanced methods of learning can be quite beneficial to the classroom and the students learning experience. The use of video screens can affect the brain functions, as well as be harmful to the eyes. Teachers and professors alike should always encourage the use of chalkboards and blackboards in the classrooms. Moreover, Visscher thinks video games can make some students more focused on their coursework, because it requires focus to play these games and does not allow the person to be distracted so easily. Visscher stated ""video games teach players new skills that cannot be experienced"" (2007, p. 31). For example, there is a game that can help children between the ages of nine and eleven improve their spelling, grammar and vocabulary level four literacy levels (Visscher, 2007, p. 32). Other games that simulate driving or flying are helpful as well, due to the fact that kids can gain useful experience in operating this equipment through the video game without being on the roadways or in the skies. This allows them to become familiar with all the responsibility of operating these things, so that when they do become drivers and flyers that are more responsible. Accordingly, some evidence suggests that video games increase violent behavior and make people gain bad activities. Also, some video games have the bad effect on people's health which can have the negative effect on people's brain and gain weight. There are other sources stated that children growth to be anti- social people who want and love video games only. Not all the video games are the same but it is depend on the Structure some games require a player to wrap up in the game and do not communicate with other people. This causes them to have underdeveloped social skills and makes it difficult for them to make friends and function in society as adults. Although many of the newer games do allow a multiplayer option when playing, this allows for children to socialize during their game play. This option is a great addition to games however this should not be a substitute for other activities for children that allows them to socialize with others and encourages team building skills. Children should also have a healthy balance of clubs, sports and other activities along with their game time.
In brief, there is no question that video games influence people's lives in both positive and negative ways. The way people use video games determines the effects on that people, as well as how they balance the time using video games. Moreover, video games can adversely affect children's health. However, video games can also have a bad influence on people, say those who are against video games and believe the effects could be negative. There are some aspects of video games that can affect players such as amount, content, structure, mechanics and context. Together, these aspects can explain different research results. Overall, video games can be good and bad for people depending on how they use them. Therefore, people should be very careful, and they should use their time wisely because video games can be bad for one's health. For someone to determine whether games are 100% negative for people to take part in is impossible, but it all reflects back to how the person utilizes the game and how they manage their time. If a person can have a balanced lifestyle, then they can lead a health life.

At the ancient time, Egyptian used honey to treat their woods. In this way, their woods could be separated from air which might contain bacteria which could cause the inflection of woods. Though people know some way to treat infection from several thousand years ago, amount of people die from inflection which caused by microorganisms. Healing infection was a world wise problem until the invention of penicillin which is a kind of antibiotics. From the day that penicillin was found, this new ""magical medicine"" saved millions of people's life. Like in the WWII, if soldiers were not treated by antibiotics, most of them who got infection might die. But as many other great discovers, antibiotics also gradually face critical and problems. For example, bacteria have resistance to antibiotics and slow development of new antibiotics. 
What happened to antibiotics? 
For decades, antibiotics have already proofed that these amazing medicines could not only used in medical aspect, but also in agriculture, animal husbandry. Antibiotics are so efficient that people are so rely on these medicines. For example, my grandfather, he needed antibiotics to treat the infection for a long time in the illness. But with the time goes on, the antibiotics that once worked didn't worked anymore, so the doctor gave him another kind of antibiotics which was more powerful than the first one. So a bad circle happened, resistance came to my grandpa. 
In an article that I read, this resistance has started for about two decades (English. B. K, Gaur. H.A.), bacteria mutate their genes to ""fight"" with medicines, antibiotics, then these once magical medicine lose their power. Also, in recent years an alarming increase in resistance of bacteria to antibiotics has been recognized worldwide by the WHO (2002)( J. FINK-GREMMELS). What's worst, mentioned by English. B. K, Gaur. H.A. in the article ""The use and abuse of antibiotics and the development of antibiotic resistance"", published on Advances in experimental medicine and biology, this resistance is enviable and bacteria always could have greater resistance to those antibiotics agents. Authors gave two examples about inevitability in the article. The first example is low exposure of antibiotics could lead low resistance and second one is occasionally resistance wild mammals probably reflects that human or animal have already been treated with antibiotics. These two experiments show that whatever the surrounding conditions are, resistances always exist and less possibility to avoid. 
People might think that if they use antibiotics carefully they might avoid this resistance from happening. However, in the most case, the usages of antibiotics also drive the development of resistance. Even appropriately use antibiotics could lead to resistance, and the uncertainly diagnosis of every day in clinical guarantee that ""overuse"" of some antibiotics will occur under the rational using. (Pichichero, 1999; Arnoldet al., 2005). At the same time, the real overuse and inappropriate use would greatly contribute to the resistance of antibiotics. 
Not only resistance, the narrow way of future development is what antibiotics have to face. Since the 1990s, both the decline in attractiveness of the antibiotic market and consolidations within the biopharmaceutical industry have resulted in a 75% decrease in the number of companies with large antibiotics R&D efforts (Moellering, R. C, Jr. 2012)(Eisenstein, B. and Hermsen, E.D. 2012). In 2004, antibiotics represented fewer than 2% of drugs in clinical development by 15 largest drug companies (Jabes, D.2011) 
Alternatives to antibiotics 
As more and more problems of antibiotics have been exposured, to treat inflections, alternatives to antibiotics seems quite needed. Bacteriophages, bacterial cell wall hydrolases, and antimicrobial peptides are the most promising agents for nowadays (Parisien. A., Allain. B., Zhang. J., Mandeville. R. and Lan. C.Q. (2008)). Basically, these alternative treatments are substitution of the normal microbial ora does not occur because these treatments kill only the targeted patho- genic bacteria, can respond quickly to the appearance of resistant bacterial mutants since treatments' different mechanisms. (Matsuzaki et al. (2005)) I think this advantage is what makes alternatives more attractive and potential than antibiotics. Instead of finding more new type or more powerful antibiotics to kill those resistance bacteria, which might cost unbelievable amount of research found, probably people need to change a method. Like the bacteriophages could mutant significantly high frequencies than bacteria, bacterial cell wall hydrolases are well understood and safety, and antimicrobial peptides have broad-spectrum activity (antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal). Also, these treatments have very rare side-effects. Advantages might change from one treatment to another, but compare to antibiotics, even new treatments need more cost to develop, it still better than let bacteria to continuously have resistance which might lead to the birth of ""superbugs"" which might be the biggest trouble to everyone also might be the reason that more and more new treatments, or alternatives to antibiotics, are invented. 
But is that possible to let alternatives to completely replace antibiotics? Professor Wilson from Department of Pharmacy Practice gave me the answer: at least in the life or death moment, the antibiotics still work very well. However, most of the time, people still need some treatments which are not that rush. I even got some idea that really shocked me. ""I could imagine ethanol, you clean your hands with ethanol and you killed pretty much everything and that works by just dehydrating the microorganisms, so I don't see any way for organism to adapt alcohol. I always wonder could we inject directly a small amount of alcohol in germs or something like that, so there might actually a way to do it that they can't form resistant to. I'm not an expert on specific antibiotics but I guess is there always some potential for the development of resistance. And I think you have to assume that as you move forward that is pretty amazing for us to have antibiotics such long time. And I always wonder if we could develop vaccines. Cause it seems to me that the best way to protect a person is to engage their immune systems. So if you can come up with a better way with a vaccine that might be a really step forward. Cause your body could actually adapt as well."" This was from Dr. Nauman who is in the School of Mechanical Engineering. And this vaccine idea really shows how huge potential alternatives to antibiotics have. 
Conclusion 
In sum, facing so many critical problems, like resistance, usage and slow development, antibiotics seems need other treatments, alternatives, to let people have better treated. Some alternatives which are efficiency have really high possibility to be used to treat infection, and have as same result as antibiotics do. So I really believe that for alternatives, there is a future for these new treatments to alternative antibiotics.

"Introduction 
	Nowadays, technology is improved second by second, and products are replaced by more advanced products. My topic, which is about computers, is that whether tablets will replace the traditional computers in universities in future. According the trend of the development of computers, my opinion toward my topic is that tablet will replace traditional one in universities in future. And my research questions about my topic specifically are how can tablet replace the traditional computers in campus, and my second research question is what advantages tablet will bring to the universities and students. I found several good resources about my research questions, including three articles and an interview with a professor who have used tablet on class. 
How can tablet replace the traditional computers in campus? 
	In the articles which I selected, the first one from Ozok, Chakraborty and Norcio (2008), which described the comparison of usability between tablet and laptop by doing an experiment, support the idea that tablet will be the mainstream of the mobile computing in the future with advance of technologies in universities. Ozok et al. designed an experiment to identify the preference between the laptop and tablet. In the experiment, there were 4 tasks for volunteers who were undergraduates in university to finish. Volunteers used tablet and laptop separately to complete these tasks which includes the reading task, writing/typing task, manipulation task and form-filling task. And the results of the reading task and manipulation task showed that, the tablet is really an efficient tool to do these two tasks, and the results of the writing task and form-filling tasks showed that it is not as easy as to use keyboard to type in. However, the stand of Ozok et al. is that tablet is still a competitive device in the future mobile computing. Additionally, nowadays most of the tablet can be linked with the keyboards, therefore the problem of tying is solved, and tablet becomes more competitive. 
	According to the interview I did with professor Lorraine, who used tablet on her class, professor Lorraine mentioned that this is a question that we cannot give the answer now. And she said using tablet to replace traditional desktops in universities, such like the computers in computerlab, and in libraries was a good point, and they were asking the similar questions because University will renew the computers after all. And she said there are still lots of problems and situations which are hard to solve if universities decide to use tablet to replace the desktops, such like the cost problems and security problems. Universities should take long time to compare the lost and advantages, and find out the solution of the situations and problems. But, the opinion of professor Lorraine toward this question is similar to that of Ozok et al. tablet is possitble to occupy the mainstream of the mobile computing the universities in future. 
What advantages will tablet bring to the universities? 
	In the third article, which summarized the teaching advantages of using a tablet on lecture by describing several examples and programs about using tablet in university lectures. Cicchino and Mirliss stated some benefits of the Tablet PCs in higher education: tablet allowed faculty to create ""digital material"" (p. 1) easily, such as the presentation, and tablet can be used as an ""interactive whiteboard"" (p. 2). The School of Architecture of the University of Texas at Austin was selected to participate the ""Rapid Adoption Program"", which identified tablet as a ""higher level of creative interaction and mobility"" (as cited in Cicchino & Mirliss, ITRC, 2002). Cicchion and Mirliss said that ""Faculty members at UOIT find Tablet PCs especially useful for presenting math and technical notations during in-class presentations"" (p. 2). In conclusion, most of the feedback from the faculty of universities which use the tablet on lecture were positive. 
	And according to the interview, professor Lorraine pointed that using tablet on lecture was more flexible and collaborative, and she mentioned that tablet is absolutely a good reader, and a good device to give presentation. She said she put the tablet on a cart which has wheels, which means she can move the cart to any classroom she want and she can use that cart to plug in and charge it easily. That is the flexibility tablet brought to professor Lorraine on lecture. Moreover, it is impossible for 100 students to take class in the laboratory, but if every student has a tablet, and they can take class in the huge lecture hall. That is the flexibility tablet brought to the students. Also, professor Lorraine said the tablet can help student to be engaged on class, because in computer lab, students always just concentrate on monitor but not instructor, and tablet solved that problem completely. And tablet was convenient when students had a teamwork, they could seat in a round with tablet and discuss with the short articles on lecture. Professor Lorraine also talked about her husband who also used tablet on lecture. She said her husband used keynote to show the slides by linking it with the projector and he could highlight the content easily by just highlighting with a pen on his tablet. Additionally, professor said there are some presentation assignments for students to work on, and tablet is a fantastic tool to do so, which improves the fluency of presentation.

Feminism 
As the development of history, the social status of female are increasing and women are gradually having more consciousness of pursuing the equality of male and female. Many girl friends of mine who claim themselves as feminists are extremely passionate about holding feminism activities. They set up a club of female leadership of school, advertised the equality of men and women in community and even joined parades to against sexual discrimination and the unfairly treat of women. And they stated feminism should be expanded in the society. But every time they did such things, there were always some objections. Some people still regard feminists as monsters, label them as ""mannish women""(Ding, 2007, p. 111) They think feminism should not exist. However, from my point of view, I think feminism should exist, especially exists in China. 
First of all, feminism has somehow changed women's lives. Feminism is range of movement and ideologies that share a common goal: "" to define, establish and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women""(Beasley, 1999, p. 11). When I asked my friends what the feminism is, they said it was about seeking equal status and opportunities for women in every field as men rather than asking for more power or superiority for women. "" Especially objecting the sexism, sexual exploitation and sexual oppression,"" said Ji Geng, female founder of the biggest Chinese feminism website. Feminism has already ""set up movement to campaign for women' rights including right to vote, to education, to work, to have equal pay and the right of having opportunity of choosing marriage."" (Echols,1989) There're some rights protected by the law, for example, Chinese Second Law on marriage, Law on protection of rights and interests of women (Angeloff & Liber, 2012, p.20) . It is because the feminism's campaigns, women are now having higher status than they earned before. 
What's more, females still get less respect compared to males. There're many processes that need feminism do. "" Women are are born with inequalities. Since we were a fetus, we were forced to be induced an abortion. Girls are asked to stay at home while boys can play crazy outside. By the time we're adult, if we don't get married, we would have an imputation of no-wanted women, while unmarried men can be regarded as eligible bachelors. If we're married, we may be abused unless we procreate a boy. There are countless examples show that we are not respected."" I heard from <name>. By the time I was doing the interview with <name>, there's a news taken place in China and was spread widely on Chinese Internet. The news is about a girl raped by a drunk man. It's popular was that the drunk man left phone number to the victim and told her call him if she got pregnant. ""Do you think it's an appalling new? But for some men, it's a common request, because the raped girls have their kids. Girls are the tools to creating their offsprings."" <name> said with an ironic smile. 
Third, sexual equality which feminism mainly advocates is men's issue too. In current society, many young men are suffering from mental illness that unable to ask for help, because it may make them less of man. A research shows that in UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49 eclipsing road accidents, cancer and heart diseases. If feminism advocates sexual equality rightly and the equality comes true, men are able to sensitive as well. 
The another perception who against the feminism claims women are now equal to men, and there's no need of feminism. This is what majority think. They think feminism is a group that advocates women want to have power to control the society. ""Having feminism is ridiculous! Don't you think women have already earned enough? As you know, women are treated as goods in ancient time, but now you have same opportunity as men. You can get educate, you can find a job, you can decide your marriage, and there're plenty laws for women protection! As I know, there's no law to protect men."" said Yuan who is opponent of feminism. However, when I ask <name> why the rape new happen even though there's a law, he became silent for a while and respond ""It's minority. At least, the drunk man know to be responsible for the kid."" 
I now agree with <name>, women are not respected. It is because the less of respect to women, the drunk man can unscrupulous harm the girl. And because the less respect, Yuan can think it only take place unmeant and the he regarded the criminal as responsible. Even there're laws prohibit the violation of woman, but the case still exist. It doesn't mean people are not afraid of laws, but if the punishment of such law isn't heavy, men would not care. The feminism should exist. 
As I mentioned above, it is true that women have get lots of rights and have same status as men in some cases. However, the problem of less respect to women is still exist. This problem may not solved by laws, it should be improved by the feminism which can advertise their opinion into people's mind. I support that feminism should exist and expand the scale.

"Problems with the Korean Educational System and ways to improve 
Purdue University 
Engl106I 
4/14/15 
In March 2009, Obama lauded for Korean educational system and Korean parents for their zeal and passion. ""That calendar may have once made sense, but today, it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea. That is no way to prepare them for a 21st-century economy."" (President, 2009) As he mentioned Korean students do not have any memorable moments in their childhood but studying through nights and nights for the exam in order to achieve a dream of getting into top universities. Because a competition for going into the prestigious college is so fierce, private tutors and private institutions became prevalent and the value of public school dropped. Trends of getting these supplemental educations leave bulk of stress and pressure on students. Korean society and educational system have to transform in a way that students get primary education from their school to eradicate unfairness, extra costs, and stress. 
The tutors and cram schools have been around for very long time in Korea. Since the Choson Dynasty (1392-1910), passing the civil service exam administered by the royal court was seen as bringing social and material success for the entire family. Due to their zeal and passion, South Korea has transformed into the world's 13th largest economy; GDP has gone up about 40,000% since 1962 (Ripley, 2011). The mindset of bringing social and material success is still ongoing. Nowadays Korean students spent their youths to get into prestigious universities where admission slots are too few compared to the number of applications. Thus, most Koreans have to get supplemental classes from tutors and cram schools to outcompete their fellow-classmates. 
Some people might argue that if studying hard in cram schools and tutors can bring goods to students, how they can be the problem. The cram schools and tutors are problem because they give so much pressure and stress to students. In 2010, among South Koreans who confessed to feeling suicidal, 53 percent blamed academic performance and educational stress for the suicidal thoughts (Koo, 2014). The average high school student sleeps about 5. 5 hours a day, because they return home from the tutor and cram school past midnight (Koo, 2014). Because they don't get enough sleeps when they should have, students decide to sleep in their regular school hours; ""When I visited some schools, I saw classrooms in which a third of the students slept while the teacher continued lecturing."" (Ripley, 2011) It is very ironic and problematic that students are learning from outside of school and not learning from the public school where they should have. 
The prevalence of tutors and cram schools cause unfairness among students and also big pressure on their families. In 2012, Korean parents spent more than $17 billion on the cram schools and tutors (Ripley, 2013). As early as pre-school, it became common going to tutors and cram schools. In 2010, 74% of students are involved with going to at least one cram school (Ripley, 2011). Because high number of students gets help these institutions, those who cannot afford those private institutions would unfortunately fall behind than others; average cost of $2,600 per student for private after-school institution (Ripley, 2011). 41 percent of students living in Seoul who go to the most prestigious university in Korea, Seoul National University, came from the 3 richest districts in Seoul (Victoria, 2013). This statistic demonstrates that richer families get the better education and have more likelihood of going to universities like Seoul National University. 
There have been many attempts in order to fix the problematic education system. There were attempts to regulate and mandate the curfew of cram schools hours by 10p.m, but teachers and owners has broken the regulations by blacking out windows and operating in residential buildings. Even back in 1980s, the government banned cram schools to humanize the education system (Ripley, 2011). In order to fix the problem of dominance of cram schools and tutors, the value of public school have to be improved in a way that students do not feel necessary to go to private tutoring industry to learn the materials that will be on the exams. In order to raise the value of school, teachers should be examined every year and compete among themselves for their job; if one is not competent among other teachers, one should be required to get additional training. With plans of completion by the 2015, Korean public school is changing in a way that helps students to engage with others and develop knowledge effectively (Victoria, 2013). Rather than simply memorizing the materials, future educational system gives opportunities to discuss and debate the materials with classmates. When above changes are made, Korean students can study efficiently and without unpleasantness. 
It is time for Korean education system to revolutionize and fix the problems. Korean students have suffered and studied through rigorous and inefficient education system for so long. When cram schools and tutors are eradicated in Korean societies and students study effectively and hard in the public school, students and parents won't feel the pressure and stress caused by these ridiculous institutions. Because I was part of this unfortunate system, I truly hope that imminent changes are upcoming to make the Korean society the better and smarter.

"Does Glass Ceiling Really Exist? 
Purdue University 
Does Glass Ceiling Really Exist? 
	Glass ceiling, known as an intangible barrier within a hierarchy that prevented women or minorities from obtaining upper-level positions, is a serious social bias (Merriam-Webster, para. 2). Whether this phenomenon exists is a debatable topic lasted for a long time. Some people believe glass ceiling phenomenon does not exist at all because it seems no one is suffering from it. Nevertheless, my personal opinion is that this phenomenon does exist in this society and it is just around us. Glass ceiling phenomenon is a serious bias towards certain people, and even worse, it has a huge influence onto different fields like business field, academic field and so on. It is not that hard to find out if it really exists because there are many evidences and examples in our lives distinguish the existence of glass ceiling phenomenon. Let's break it down into pieces in order to make people realize glass ceiling is here just around us. 
	Working places are the most significant area that we could tell glass ceiling. According to Catalyst, women currently hold 20 (4.0%) of CEO positions at S&P 500 companies in this world. The reason why there are way more male CEOs than female CEOs is glass ceiling phenomenon. This transparent barrier stops female from getting into administrative positions. The higher the positions are, the fewer the females will be. One of my working experiences could also be a good explanation. Since I worked at CGB (China Guangfa Bank) last summer, I have realized this phenomenon. Every time we had conference, the upper-level administrative leaders includes presidents are more likely to be males instead of females. Females were doing very basic work like bank tellers or lobby managers. By talking with them, I felt some of them are well capable to handle higher position because they all have the professional skills as other males do. I was confusing about that situation, but then I suddenly realized the existence of this kind of bias towards females. This is not case-by-case, think about the journal Harvard Business Review, even the celebrities posted on that journal were more males. That is, working place is also the place where glass ceiling exists. 
	Besides working places, even academic field on campus has the same situation. Professor <name> (2016) also shared an example of gender bias in academic field. Females are as easy as males to get a job in university; however, those females will have lower salary increasing rate comparing to other male employees. It is not because they are not good and capable enough, they just have lower salary ( <name> personal communication, March 30, 2016). According to Institute for Women Policy Research, in 2015, female full-time workers made only 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a gender wage gap of 21 percent (Para. 1). On the other hand, those female employees are even harder to get promotion in their occupations, unable to get upper-level positions has nothing to do with whether they are lacking of professional abilities and personal qualities, the reason for keeping those female employees is trying to show that they have a so called ""gender balance"" in their department ( <name> 2016). Female employees do not have a chance to do the ""core assignment"" of the departments, they are more likely to be assigned as some jobs like working at front table. Professor <name> (2016) also mentioned a policy called ""stop the clock"" which means a female professor's probation will be one more year longer than others if she is going to give a birth to her baby. Everyone wants the probation be as short as possible but ""stop the clock"" is definitely unfair for females; there might be other things that attract males' attention just like female has a baby, but why it is not applicable for males to use ""stop the clock"". Females should not be treated unequally that way, but glass ceiling has even more influence toward other fields like politics. 
	Glass ceiling exists in politics field as well. According to Cahoon (2016), ""we are currently living under a record-high number of simultaneous female world leaders. For several years, the stable status quo has been around 20 female world leaders at any given time. For much of 2014, the number was 22--a record high"" (Para. 2). Though in 2014 the percentage of female leaders is a peak, there were only 22 female world leaders. Comparing to male presidents, vice-presidents and prime ministers, this percentage is way less than male leaders'. All in all, it is easy to tell that females in politics fields are also extremely hard to get promotion. 
	Social study professors think it that way as well. One of the professors who is researching on gender bias aspect even gave me the causes of glass ceiling problem. She told me that historical reason is the most basic one. Back to the beginning of last century, females did not go to work like a man. Then after world war two, they started to enter the business field and worked as men's jobs. However, they can only do pink-collar work and ended up the job at a low level due to their low education level. Also, the men in charge are more likely to get along with people who have same gender with him. Lastly, stereotypes towards females at that that was also a big reason because women were ""supposed"" to stay at home and take care of the kids ( <name> personal communication, March 31, 2016). Those causes not only verified the existence of glass ceiling phenomenon, but explained how it was formed as time went by. 
	Some people may hold the opinion that glass ceiling is not real because there are many female dominated fields like textile industry. For those female dominated industries, I have to admit there are way more female employees than males. However, those females are mostly textile workers instead of the administrative leaders ( <name> , 2016). They work in the factory and it is very hard for them to get promotion. Even they have chances to be a leader, it will be slower than other male workers who have the same working skills and experiences. The general manager, department managers and other upper-level positions are mostly males, so how could not we tell the existence of glass ceiling? 
	Obviously, glass ceiling is an existing serious social problem around the globe. It has a broad influence toward working places, academic fields and even politics aspects. Females in this society are still suffering from it, this gender bias. People may not fix it immediately, but we could at least do something to make it better. Publishing laws is a good way to protect females' rights and as time flies, we will all be aware of what the truth and justice are ( <name> 2016). At that time, glass ceiling will dissolve itself and this problem will no longer be a problem.

Argumentative Writing Assignment 
Every college student deserves an amazing and meaningful college life. Life in college consists of many appealing parts, including courses, homework, social networking activities, personal relationships, food, and so on. Although food is very important in everyone's daily life, sometimes it may have higher potential to be neglected when comparing to other college activities. Food serves as sources of energy, and unsuspiciously, good food can make people in a good mood. The university dining court is one of the most important parts of students' college life. Nowadays, there are some debates about the necessity of providing Chinese food at Purdue University dining court. Some people argue that it is not necessary for Purdue providing Chinese food at the university dining court, while others state that Chinese food should be provided. In my personal opinion, I hold the view that Purdue should definitely provide Chinese food at university dining court. In the following part of this paper, three evidences are provided to support my point of view, which include the increasing international students and scholars' enrollment at Purdue, the popularity of Chinese food among Americans and the importance of food diversity in university dining court, as well as the Chinese food's nutrition. 
First of all, the increasing amount of international students and scholars especially Chinese students and scholars shows the increasing needs for Chinese food. 
Fig. 1 Purdue university ten years enrollment trends of international students 
Figure 2 the top ten places of origin of international students enrolled in fall 2014 
Source: Purdue ISS Enrollment & Statistical Report, fall 2014. 
According to Purdue University international students and scholars (ISS) enrollment & statistical report in fall 2014 (Purdue ISS Enrollment & Statistical Report, fall 2014), Purdue University's total international student enrollment ranked 2nd among U.S. public institutions and there were a total of 9080 students from abroad. The international student body comprised 23.4% of the total number of enrolled students and students from China (the total number was 4617) ranked first in total international enrollment. Two figures are provided in order to provide a more clear view about the enrollment trend of international student. Figure 1 is Purdue University ten-year enrollment trends of international students, which has a very clear increasing trends especially for undergraduate students. Figure 2 is the top ten places of origin of international students enrolled in fall 2014, which illustrates that students from China account for 51% of total enrolled international students. From my personal experiences, the Chinese restaurants around Purdue campus, within Great Lafayette area, or even more far away, are usually full of people, especially college students and scholars. Based on those enrollment and statistical information along with the Chinese restaurant situations, we can state that there are increasing Chinese food demand for students and scholars at Purdue University. There is no reason for Purdue University dining court not to provide Chinese food based on such big increasing population of Chinese students on campus each year. 
Secondly, not only Chinese students like to eat Chinese food, but also American students welcome the Chinese cuisine. According to Chen's book about the story of Chinese food in America (Chen, 2014), it says that American diners began to flock to Chinese restaurants more than a century ago, making Chinese food the first mass-consumed cuisine in the United States. Besides, by 1980, Chinese food had become the country's most popular ethnic cuisine. These information can provide evidences that serving Chinese food at Purdue dining court not only benefit the Chinese students, but also can satisfy the taste of American students. Moreover, food diversity is a very important concept at university dining court, which also corresponds to Purdue's great attention on diversity. Serving Chinese food at Purdue dining court is a win-win strategy. On one side, it fulfills students' needs for Chinese food and they are willing to pay more money on their meal plan, which can increase the university income. On the other side, food diversity can support the culture diversity of university, and gain good reputation for Purdue that will attract more potential students in the future. 
Last but not the least, Chinese food can fulfill nutrition requirements since it use many nutritive ingredients, including vegetables, meat, bean product, and so on. In term of Chinese vegetables, Wills' (Wills, et. al, 1984) study about the nutrient composition of 15 types of Chinese vegetables, including Chinese chives, Chinese spinach, Chinese white cabbage, mustard cabbage, Chinese flowering cabbage, Chinese cabbage, garland chrysanthemum, water spinach, watercress, hairy melon, wax gourd, angled luffa, bitter melon, bean sprouts, and yard-long beans, firstly presented comprehensive data for Chinese vegetables about the values of dietary fiber, individual sugars, starch, organic acids, magnesium, and zinc. According to the conclusion of this article, many Chinese vegetables can be considered as useful sources of various nutrients, and vitamin C was presented in all vegetables at nutritionally significant levels. Moreover, most of these vegetables are available in groceries within great Lafayette area. I believe that Purdue dining court can get good prices on those vegetables when ordering large amount. 
In summary, Chinese food should be provided at Purdue University dining court mainly due to three reasons. The first one is the increasing Chinese food needs of increasing population of international students and scholars, especially Chinese students and scholars at Purdue. The second one is that Chinese food also gain popularities among American students and serving Chinese food can help to increasing the food diversity at Purdue University dining court. The third one is that Chinese food use many nutritive ingredients that can support the nutrition requirement. In addition, I suggest that Purdue dining court may consider to offer two types of Chinese food including authentic Chinese food and American style Chinese food to fulfill the different taste demand for different group of students.

"Necessity of physical education in schools 
Purdue University 
04/10/2015 
In these years Chinese people have been paying increasing attention to education for their children. A public controversy regarding whether physical education and exercise are needed for students in schools arises under the influence of this increasingly obvious pure-academic centered Chinese educational system. Some people may claim that everyone knows the benefits of exercise and school can hardly make a difference in their attitude towards exercise and their exercise regimes. Parents, in particular, always want their kids to behave and study hard in school, which minimizes their exercise intensity. (Lee 2011) On the other hand, those whose disagree with this point of view would advocate for physical education and exercise. From my personal perspective, it is absolutely necessary for Chinese students to receive adequate physical education and take exercise regularly. I will present some evidence and reasons as following. 
	First and foremost, advanced and effective physical education corrects student's' perceptions and attitudes toward exercise. Physical exercise do enhances fitness and makes people healthier but if an individual does not have an appropriate exercise consciousness and regular routine, he would possibly undergo counterproductive workout. For example , there is an survey aims to explore behaviors and attitudes towards exercise among older Chinese immigrants in the UK, in which most of respondents exercise in unreasonable regimes, which may cause a highly risky situation. Their attitudes towards health and exercise were based on traditional Chinese values and their incorrect opinions. (Liu, Zhen mi; Speed, Shaun; Beaver, Kinta; 2012) If they receive decent physical education and correct guidance, it would be better. Therefore, physical education does not just help students understand those superficial ideas. To help students establish good exercise values is the core of physical education. 
	What's more, physical education and exercise may also benefit students by balancing their life. This statement is based on the current Chinese educational system. Nowadays students are required to concentrate much more on their academic performance and their grades. To be specific, they are forced to do a lot of academic work and exhausted because of heavy brainwork. Whereas their most frequently practiced sports may be broadcast exercise taking just 10 minutes out of their busy study routine. (Lee 2011) If this kind of situation persists for a long run, serious problems may occur, such as mental and physical illness, a decline of study efficiency and inactive study. In order to meet the balance between physiology and psychology, physical education and physical exercise is definitely needed to adjust students' lives. For instance, after doing a series of complex assignments, a student could relax and enjoy themselves by exercising on the playground, rather than sit in the classroom all day. Also most of physical education courses do not force students to memorize knowledge. On the contrary, physical education provides students with some more interesting knowledge, which is a major difference that distinguishes PE and normal education. 
	On the other hand, psychologically, PE could be a regulator that helps develop personal character. As I've mentioned before, the education system is progressive . Students are actually required to be more comprehensive and more well-around, despite the fact that academic ability is primarily emphasized. Thus, physical education and physical exercise would be a perfect vehicle for developing abilities. We can see that, when students interact by exercising and doing sports during physical education, they are imperceptibly developing their sport spirit leadership, networking skills, (Rick Nauert, 2010) teams spirit and numerous things. They would understand the importance of mutual competition (Evans, 2013), respect and fairness and all of these elements are indispensable for integrating a person's healthy characteristics, which are extremely important in his future. In particular, a student may gain confidence as long as he is exercising correctly and he may get more confident. It could be the key factor that determines his career path because confidence is so influential for one's work performance. 
	To sum up, Chinese high schools need more physical education classes and Chinese students deserve sufficient exercise. My analysis indicates that the better physical education and physical exercise students receive, the better exercise regime, the more efficient time management, and better characters they have. I strongly suggest schools to have more physical education courses and physical exercise. Moreover, an effective compulsory regulation policy should be enforced to guarantee that every physically qualified student could get involved to physical education courses as well as physical exercise in case of unreasonable occupation of PE class and exercise by teachers of exam course.

Does smoking and cancer have a correlation? 
Most people have witnessed that one can be a victim of cancer even if they have never touched a cigarette in their whole life. Others have seen that, chain-smoker's live life free from any health problem. But still these shouldn't be used to debunk the fact that smoking is actually responsible for cancer to some extent. Besides cancer, it can also have numerous detrimental effects on the body. Upon my research, interview report and synthesis paper I have come to understand that, there is a strong correlation between smoking and cancer. 
But according to Siepmann, J. P., MD. (n.d.). Smoking does not cause lung cancer, WHO 1999 statistics. Editorial from the Journal of Theoretics (Oct/Nov 1999), if you smoke, there is only 10% chance or less that you will get lung cancer. It also says that a US white male smoker has a 8%chance of dying from lung cancer; whereas a US white male non-smoker has a 1% chance of dying from lung cancer. Even though the chance for dying from lung cancer if you smoke is 8%, by not smoking you can actually decrease that chance by 7%. Smoking increases the chance of dying by lung cancer. And smoking contributes to many other diseases besides lung cancer; like cancer in the mouth, colon, neck etc. and diseases like emphysema, COPD and many more. These numbers are not enough to debunk the fact that smoking and cancer do have a correlation. As I have researched for my essay, I have found many more supporting evidence on this. 
Firstly, during my interview with Dr. <name> ( <name>, personal communication, April 16, 2016), an epidemiologist, I discovered a lot on the correlation between cancer and smoking. She had done research on cancer at <name of university> and at Purdue. Therefore, with her knowledge on cancer and epidemiology, she was really helpful. According to her, smoking is detrimental to health and it affects all organs of the body. Smoking cigarettes causes one to inhale nicotine which not only causes addiction but also harms the lungs in various ways like destroying the lung cells. She also says that lung cancer may have a lot of causes but smoking is ""a contributing factor"". This is because nicotine effects lung tissues aiding in lung cancer and tar, a component of cigarette smoke deposits in lung and harms it. So as a result breathing capacity is reduced. She also mentioned that smoking and cancer can be correlated. Smoking harms the lungs as well as acts as a factor in causing cancer like lung cancer, mouth cancer, oral cancer, esophageal cancer and even stomach cancer. Smoking is said to be a leading cause for oral cancer. 
Secondly, alongside my interview I also researched articles from the Cancer Research UK, National Cancer Institute and Center for Disease Control to support my thesis statement. According to an organization that researches on cancer, Cancer Research UK (2015), 1 in 4 cancer deaths in the UK are caused by excessive smoking. In the 20th Century alone, 100 million deaths worldwide have been linked to the smoking of cigarettes. It also talked about the harmful chemicals present in cigarettes that contribute towards damaging the DNA of the cell and then finally turning them cancerous. Again, according to the National Cancer Institute (2014), cigarettes contain up to 250 KNOWN harmful substances, 69 of which are KNOWN to cause cancer. It also mentions other harmful effects cigarette can have on the body besides cancer for example Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), diabetes, cataracts and even osteoporosis. Smoking can also make it harder for a woman to get pregnant and a woman who smokes during her pregnancy risks the chance of killing her unborn baby and if not, risks the chance of having a premature or abnormal baby. Men that smoke a lot risk a higher chance of developing erectile dysfunction at an early age. The article from the Center for Disease Control (2016), strengthens both these articles. The article investigates the link between smoking and cancer, of how smoking can weaken the immune system and also similar to what the first article had stated about how the DNA becomes affected by cigarette smoke and can often cause cells to mutate and grow uncontrollably, forming cancerous tumors. According to the CDC, if everyone stopped smoking, 33.33% of deaths from cancer would have been reduced in the US alone. 
Although, people say that smokers sometimes do not get affected by lung cancer or any cancer type, it does not make smoking harmless. Over the years there have been instances when smokers have died natural deaths or have lived their life without being victims to cancer. So they might say that smoking and cancer have no correlation as they were unaffected. But their assertion may not be entirely correct as because this percentage of unaffected people is really small. According to the American Lung Association, men who smoke are 23 times more likely to get cancer and women who smoke are 13 times greater to get cancer. So the percentage of non smokers who are not affected by cancer is very less. 
From this information it is safe to deduce that smoking and cancer do have a correlation. If more people know about this, they could refrain from smoking or tell others about it. This will reduce number of smokers hence number of diseases due to smoking and also cancer. Those who do not smoke can learn more about it and become more cautious about avoiding smoking. Smokers can gain more knowledge on this and reduce smoking or even quit. This will have great effects on their health and will push towards reducing harmful effects due to smoking on human health and the environment. With more information on this topic, researchers will also be benefitted by the findings on this topic. Therefore, I would like to know about the effects smoking has on lungs, what carcinogenic agents cigarettes contain, the effects of the carcinogenic agents on lungs, if the effects can lead to cancer and many more. With these research I hope to be more enlightened about smoking and its relation to cancer.

Violence in Video Games
Video games have become an institution in our culture today. Many feel that the increase in violent content has led to many children acting out and be more aggressive. The problem is that all studies that have been done have shown that there is a correlation but no causation showing that video games are not to be blamed for recent events such as the columbine shootings. This paper is not advocating violent content in video games but rather showing that the content is not the cause of violence.
In the most recent experiments on violence in video games the goal has been to find the short term effects leading to conclusions that can't be applied to most situations. The current model for experimentation usually deals with surveys before playing and after while playing the subject may be observed and in many cases they will be monitored to see their heart rate and skin temperature. After the subject usually between plays the game they will be observed in ""free-time"" to see whether they are more aggressive and hostile. In all experiments I have come across they have come to conclusions that change if any occurs is very small and cannot be linked to violence. In one of my sources I found that experiments that use the little change in aggression that occurs there is a difference cause by rewording trait aggression and the state of aggression.(2)
In a recent study the issue of trait aggression has come to light showing that many of the findings of previous experiments have been wrong in the sense that they didn't factor in the subject's previous aggression. When traits of aggression enter the equation a much more balanced view comes. The findings suddenly show that many of the previously aggressive kids were just slightly more aggressive almost to the point of not recognizing it. Many of the previously non-aggressive kids were found to show no difference in their aggression and hostility. This is due to their state of aggression previous to the experiment. Some results did show however that very few of the aggressive subjects had more of a change when exposed to violent video games (1).
Many experiments now used VR technology which is designed to immerse the subject in the game creating a more real gaming experience (7). The VR technology is virtual reality which creates the illusion that the subject is in the game (7). With this sort of gaming many expected the results to show much higher levels of aggression after playing. They found that even with this immersion technique that many of the results showed no higher levels of aggression and hostility (7). This is due to the fact that violent video games are not the cause of violent behavior and cannot be linked to any cases.
When subjects were shown violent TV shows they found many similar results to video games. The fact is that video games are not the only cause and that we have to look at the subjects themselves rather than what TV shows or video games they are watching. It is true that in the short term video games have been shown to slightly increase aggression but it has not been found why. This furthers the fact that in all aspects of this subject they have found causation which is a subtle link but no causation which would be cause for alarm.
After the Columbine shootings many felt that the video games and music that the kids were playing and listening to was the source of their violent acts. In the movie ""Bowling for Columbine"" artist Marilyn Manson was asked what he would say to the kids if given the chance and he said, ""I wouldn't say anything... I would listen."" This is the concept that many who feel that violent media content is the source of violent acts need to come to terms with. The content in these cases should not be what is looked at rather the kids lives and behaviors should be looked at. It's true that aggressive kids should probably not be open to violent content but the same could be said for the criminally insane. The problem is that in many of these cases the parents and peers of the kids are to blame for their behavior.
When children are taunted they find themselves angry. This is a crucial point in time for their parents to be there for them. When kids are taunted by peers and have no parents to turn to they may look for other forms of release. The kids that committed the horrible crime at Columbine had played violent video games but they took it upon themselves to steal their parent's guns and open fire on their school. Video games did not teach them to fire a gun they were just a hobby. The kid's aggressive traits and previous behavior is what counts.
In the shooting at columbine Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were known players of the video game ""Doom"" and this was what many looked at when trying to make a case against video games (4). In April 2007 Seung-Hui Cho committed the Virginia-Tech Massacre in which he gunned down 32 students and professors sparking the debate of violent video games yet again (4). It was found later that Cho had little or no exposure to video games which removed the connection between violent video games and violence (4). Sulejman Talovic killed five people in a Utah mall and when investigated it was found that he had owned no video games (4). The point is that in these extreme cases of violence in which young males commit horrible atrocities there is no link between them and video games.
Many anti-video game advocates use violent video games as a reason in which young males commit violence. This is a horrible example considering how many young males actually play video games. It is found that no case or experiment can show a link between violent content in video games and violent acts occurring. If there was a link between violent acts and violent video games it would cause many more violent shootings to occur.
In a study done by two Australian psychiatrists to see the effects of violent content in video games they found very ambiguous results. Their conclusions found that there may be a link that violent content increases aggressive behavior but could not find enough evidence to make that assumption. They hypothesized that traits already found in their subjects were much more prevalent after playing these games (6). This led them to many of the same conclusions other studies experienced. Previous traits in individuals are what lead to aggressive and sometimes violent actions not the fact that they play video games.
In all of the experiments I found the main issue was that they dealt with the short-term effects of violent content in video games. No study has yet been done to see what the long-term effects of violent content in video games are. It is necessary to make a final conclusion on this debate for an experiment to be conducted that shows how long-term playing of violent video games has an effect on children. So far short-term studies have found nothing and furthermore nothing conclusive. The fact is that without such a study there will never be a link between violent content in video games and violent, aggressive and hostile behavior.

"Social Media 
Introduction 
	In this information era, information technology has changed people's life. Social media is one example of a technology that has changed the way people communicate. 
For example, Facebook and Twitter have become popular social media software that have changed everyday communication. It is also rather amazing to see how email has replaced letter writing as one of the most common and formal ways that people communicate. After that, the cellphone and instant messenger software came out. And we can see most people take a cellphone with their daily life. But the social media is a whole new area. Because they cannot only be used as email or instant messenger software, but more than that. You can also use it as a newspaper, a blog, or even an advertising platform. That is why the social media technology are is closely linked to daily life in many ways. And it's worth to find out the impact of social on people's life. Because teenagers and college students are the main groups of people who use social media. It's good to start this research by analyze the impact of social media on these people. And education and family are two main parts of their daily life. Therefore, the research questions of this paper are as follows are what is essential differences between the social media and other traditional means of social communication like face-to face talk? How social medial changed young people's life in higher education and family relationships. 
Social media and education 
In the interview, I asked my TA of computer science class, have he ever use social media communicate with his student in teaching progress. He answered me due to rules of computer science department, to avoid personal information or test answer leakage, it is forbidden for them to use their personal social media like Facebook or Twitter in the teaching progress. However, computer department has its own social medial web page which called Piazza. In this page, the instructor, TA and students can discuss study question with each other. Student can post a question on the web page, and not only the instructor, but all the other student can fellow the question and are encouraged to discuss. It is worth to mention that, in the article Mobile computing devices in higher education: Student perspectives on learning with cellphones, smartphones & social media, the author also stated that the mobile dives and social medial allow student interaction with content and also help them study regardless of location (Joanne, & Michael, 2013, p. 21). In addition, they all mentioned that the social medial can also detract the students' attention at some level. All these data show me that how well the social media technology can be used in higher education. Obviously, the social media is a great tools and give us a new way of communication in teaching progress. But student should it appropriately, because it may distracting them sometimes. 
Social media and adult-youth relationship 
As my TA are also an international student, I also asked him have he ever use social media communicate with his parents. As I expected, his answer is yes. He said that in the past, the only way he can communicate with parents is by phone call. But today, he can use social media, not only he can send text, picture or video online, but more important, his parents can get his information in real time by check his status update on social media which allow them keep track on his daily life. And his also check his parents' status and this one give a close relationship with his parents. In the article Mentoring in the digital age: Social media use in adult-youth relationships (Sarah, et al., 2014, p. 31), the author made a analysis in use of social media in the relationships between teenager and adult. The results showed that the impact of digital media use in mentoring relationship was generally perceived to be neutral or positive. And the researchers pointed out in particular that the use of social media ""does not seem to detract from the closeness and quality of face-to-face mentoring relationships, but may actually supplement and strengthen them."" (Sarah, et al., 2014, p. 31). Therefore, all these data showed us the social media can be used as a great tools in adult-youth relationship and can mutual promote the traditional ways of adult-youth communication. 
Conclusion 
In general, by analyzing the data from interview and articles, there is reason to believe that the social media helped young people live better in many areas such as higher education and family relationships. But the data also showed us, it will have some problems if teenager don't use social media improperly. However, like all the advanced technology, the technology itself is good. What impact it may have is depends on how people use it. As the result by analyzing the data, the social media have more chance to make people's life better instead of causing problem.

"Video Games: A New Era of Sports? 
Kobe Bryant just retired from NBA, a real and traditional sport association a few days ago. Myriad of people in the world sat in front of televisions and shared this moment. We all say that this twenty-years long journey of a man is a miracle. And half a year ago, on the other side of the earth, an eminent player of Star Craft, Lee 'Flash' Young Ho retired from his team. Flash's career created a new and hard-to-reach height for every Star Craft player. Until today, many players still respect him as the greatest player of Star Craft. 
Kobe Bryant, Flash, they are both the greatest players, athletes of their periods. But, not all people treat them as the same kind of players and believe that basketball and video games could be categorized as sports. They used the definition from Merriam- Webster Dictionary as a kind of evidence: Sport is a contest or game in which people do certain physical activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other. They emphasized 'physical activities' and mentioned that video games can contain a part of competition, but none of them requires high physical ability. In addition, games like Star Craft need players with a mighty heart, a good and effective strategy. For those traditional sports, team spirit is vital to win. In effect, for them, video games are parallel to sports. Matthew Clough, 2016 
After I read an article which supports that video games should not be classified as a sport. I noticed there was only one comment at the bottom of the page. It said in a cynical way: 'If stupidity has mass, then you are a black hole. -----from gamers'. African American fight for centuries to get their justice, to get their right and power to be seen as a normal human. Three score years after I have a dream, gamers insist they today are still being seared in the flame of injustice. They trained day by day and their APM can be over 1200-means more than twenty actions done by keyboard and computer mouse in one second. Those professional players practice dedicatedly and diligently to get a few dollars, no more than ten thousands of dollars. For instance, the whole bonus pool of GSL Finals usually is only one percent of Kobe Bryant's salary which is twenty-two millions of dollars. Most players dedicate best time of their life into video games. The debut of Flash was at the time when he was only 14 years old. And he left his stage eight years later. At the same age, we are in school and quarrel with our parents. For their dedication, video games are more popular among different generations and becoming a beloved pastime, sport. 
From what Matthew Clough said, it is stupid and ridiculous to make team spirit equal to sports. There is no doubt that most physical sports need cooperation, good assist and support from your teammates and to rebut this, the first thing comes to my mind is table tennis Ping-Pang and then boxing, high jump, long jump. So many sports could and should be done by one person. Players may get aid from their coaches, analysts and medicals, but in the match, on the way to break records and limits, there is no team spirit. Thus, nobody is able to say that video games should not be classified as sports because video games don't require team spirit, no need to mention those games what are played as a league. And of course, as I said before, a strong physical exertion is also a demand of video games. 
In the future, VR equipment becomes common in people's life. More jerk need to be done while playing computer/video games. As a truth, not all video games can be seen as a sport. But for those games including athletic ability and mental strength, when played in VR instruments, would be more like, even same as those conventional sports. 
But still, VR is an illusion. Keyboard, Computer mouse and Game grip are still the trident of video games and discrimination of video games always exist. I still remember the day of GSL finals, the host said to the champion Im MVP another South Korean Star Craft player and audience with tears in his orbits: 'My parents said to me, Jones, it is just a game, quit it.' Yes, so many people are 'racist', not for ethnicity, but for matches. Nevertheless, before the light from dawn, there always is full of dark. I also remember that host said in the end:"" Being here today, people from all over the world, share this moment. It is nothing that money can do. It is a miracle."" Exactly, it is a miracle and it is a new era.

"Is the Chinese Government Able to Solve Food Safety Problems? 
China has been suffering serious food safety problems for several years. Accidents about food safety happen almost every day. People become afraid of the living condition they are currently in so they choose to turn to the government for help. Many people believe that the government in China has enough authority on food safety problems and the government can solve any difficulty they meet with. Ironically, once a food safety accident take place, the first thing people always judge is the poor management on food issues from the government. In a word, most of the people think the government should be professional to deal with food safety problems. However, I do not think the Chinese government can manage these problems efficiently. Instead, it's more efficiently to control food safety problems by people themselves. 
The Chinese government invests billions of RMB every year to rebuild food factories with unqualified processing condition, especially for those old factories which are located in rural areas. It seems like this measure is beneficially aims at improving food quality and people's health. Nevertheless, according to Yu 2015, people who know this investment in some of those areas report that the factories there have never received the money pp. 3-5. The poor condition of food processing has never changed. After long-term investigation, it finally comes out that these money is not appropriately distributed and used by the the government officers. Some greedy officers use the money secretly to purchase expensive houses and cars for themselves. They even consume high quality food in luxury restaurants with the money. Although the government do release the policy about investing money to improve food safety problems, it is corruption that always leads to the failure. 
On the other hand, the food safety problems in China is mainly caused by lacking knowledge about hygiene and contamination. An American reporter Huehnergarth 2014, who has been living in China for 15 years, once stated that Food factories prefer to employ workers who have less knowledge because they are all cheap labors pp. 7-8. Many of those workers even do not successfully graduated from primary school. It's difficult for the Chinese government to offer education chance for everyone due to an extremely large amount of population in China. Although the government have already added classes in high schools and universities about introducing the importance of food safety, these necessary classes are easily underestimated by students and teachers. In another word, the popularization given by the government on food issues is neglected by people to a large extent because people think the food safety issues are none of their business. The government should deal with it. Whether to learn or not all depends on every individual. There is nothing to do with to improve the current situation unless the knowledge level of the citizens being raised. This is the hardest part that the government cannot have access to. 
Moreover, the Chinese government today is used to concealing the fact of many serious accidents, including food safety accidents. The reason why the government decide to do this is to calm people down. They think the public do not have to know all the details. However, once they know that how many people died in the accident or how serious the accident was, the whole society will be placed in a nervous phenomenon. In fact, it's harmful to conceal the fact because people will easily neglect the danger around them if an accident take place again, but they do not have any solution. The more wonderful utopia the government make for the public, the more dangerous situation the public will be in. People have the right to get access to the truth. For food issues, there are still many inside stories that the public do not know. They will never learn a lesson from the previous accidents and pay more attention on protecting themselves. This is another reason why the Chinese government cannot deal with the food safety problem efficiently. 
Although the Chinese government have taken every effort to deal with the serious food safety problems, things are still out of control. There are many disadvantages existing. That is why I don not think the government can deal with the food safety problems efficiently. On the contrary, it is better to switch a direction of problem solving. Why not change the situation by people themselves now that the government cannot work effectively?

"Wake Up, Only Application System is the Murder 
Looking through the whole educational system, I believe the university application should be the key stone around other aspects. The university application system not only is the door to university but is the leader of high school students, influencing those students in many area. As a student having studied in China from 10th grade to 11th grade, and finally having applied universities in the US, I fully realized the importance of university application system. It actually contains recruitment's criteria, opportunities provided to students and admission committee, with each of them has impact on students development and opportunity of going to university. 
Criteria used in the system influence one's development more or less. For China and the US, they have different university application system. The one in China is to do with Gaokao, for most of high school students in China. Comparing with this, the one in the US would be more complicated, which requires SAT, GPA, Application Essay, rewards received during high school, recommendation letters, and TOEFL, the one only for international students. From my perspective, those supplemental materials above can be considered as criteria that influence students' development in high school. Different criteria has very influence on student. In terms of those standard tests such as Gaokao, SAT, and TOEFL, they have students concentrated on learning, guaranteeing students to receive those fundamental knowledge required by tests. Although those knowledge may seem to be only useful in tests, it gradually shapes students' opinions related to social issues, souls with which to feel the daily life, and judgments toward things around. Students grow up thanks to those tests. Speaking of Application Essay, it depends on universities. While some universities ask students to write down their reasons of applying such university, some hope students to write down thoughts such as that how the world shape their dreams. When students think about those questions, most of them would start reflections of their life, seeking for their goals, dream, and they themselves. After such reflection, the way to future become more clear and brighter because, throughout a process of thinking, they would be steadfast in tracing dreams. Another criteria, rewards received during high school, likewise plays a vital role on students. In order to enrich background or experience, students in high school would make efforts to taking so much competitions. Even though this might be too harsh for students, it actually forces them to learn comprehensively and deep; it somehow makes them to be competitive than others. Not only could rewards make deep impressions on university but also enhance students' personality. In terms of recommendation letter which may be written by people that understand so well, it indirectly push students to build up strong relationship with others, especially with those noble people. And that is to say, students learn social skills outside the class room other than knowledge printed on textbooks. That criteria used by university application system are truly change and influence students in a positive way. However, not all of those criteria are considered in the China's system which almost only contains examination. As a result, students and high school become scored-oriented and only care about number from tests. Even though some schools have a lot of activities by which students to be influenced and thereby gain such experience, not so much students devote themselves into activities, especially for those introverted students because there are not such object or assessment to force them. Consequently, some students might not have any rewards or good social relationship after high school. And this situation is happening in China. 
Opportunities provided by different university application system are different. The obvious one example should be times that students have for tests. Gaokao, as I have mentioned is only way to university to most students, is held only once a year in China. Therefore, like the title I put for on another essay I wrote, it is a one-shot gambling. Students put their 12-year effort on this test. If one fails, the way out is quit or waiting one more year. On the contrary, the application system in the US allows students to take tests many times and to submit it tests' scores more than once in order to let them show the best to university and prevent a situation that the very test is to determine one's future. University is a place providing more chances and opportunities to students, isn't it? However, under such system in China, could one deny that luck doesn't play a role in it? Luck should not takes part in this game. On the other hand, from my point of view, the difference of opportunities exists in choosing universities when one apply and after being accepted. According to the policy applied in Gaokao, students have to complete a form of priority of university they want to get in after the Gaokao, before knowing the scores. In this situation, guessing the scores, students might be over cautious, worrying about missing top university for higher scores than they guessed or not being accepted by university for lower scores. Moreover, after being accepted by the certain university, one is only allowed to enter this university and no changing remained on the platform. Everything ends at that point. Therefore, this rule would led to higher-scores students studying missing top universities. On the opposite, the application system in the US totally run in a distinctive way. By allowing students apply unlimited universities and choosing universities that accept them, the system protect equal opportunities for students. University application system should consider about that. 
While those invariable characteristics exist in two systems, there is one flexible thing exists in university application system, which is called admission committee. In each system, even the one in the US, there are conflict happening during reviewing students' materials. Therefore, the admission committee exists as lubricant, reducing conflict and ensuring fairness as much as possible. For example, according to one counselor working admission committee in Purdue University, when students are on the border of lines, he would bring those material to the committee and have discussion with other counselors in order to make it fair both to that students and other applicants. By doing so, guarantee of fair decision is made. What's more, in order to keep personal criteria away from reviewing applications, admission committee holds training for each qualified counselor every summer, prior to the start of application, based on his statement. However, the admission committee in China does not have those functions. It only decides incoming enrollment's number. As a consequence, admission committee is more scientific for it has more reasonable functions, providing further chances for students. 
In conclusion, in comparison around criteria, opportunities, and fairness, the system in China reduce students' chances going to top universities, and more importantly, it is hard to ensure divers development of personality not to be covered by the only criteria, Gaokao. As a result, application system murders students those potential opportunities, making it so hard to enter top universities without high scores. Improvement ought to be applied on the system.

"Mobile Game Explosion 
Unusually poor gaming experience, in the major game I play, Defense of the Ancient 2, and the flowing of negative mood about the gaming future among gaming video, present by random players, have lead me to question whether if the traditional gaming market, which compose up by consoles gaming market and personal computer gaming market, is going downhill. After having an amusing interview with an expert in the field of personal computer games and a time consuming research on internet by my own, I came up with a solid position on the question I started. Traditional game have been depleted its energy in attracting players, and its leading place in entertainment will be taken by mobile game. The statistic data and comparison will be present in order to support the position. 
	Statistically, mobile game is showing its unlimited potential aptitude of profit producing, gaining huge attention from world famous companies. As a new industry, mobile game has an incredible growing speed in sale volume. According to the VB news, the managing director of game investigate bank Digi-Capital predicted that the sale volume of mobile game market will achieve an increasing of 23.6% annually through 2011 till 2017, while the increasing speed of traditional gaming market remains as 10.1% annually(Wingfield 2012). Having such big different of potential, mobile game easily drawn attention of big companies from traditional gaming to its own. An article on New York Times shows that one of the biggest telecommunications provider in Japan, Soft Bank, decided to acquire half of the stake, by paying 1. 5 billion dollars, of a mobile game company (Pfanner, 2013). Even though the mobile game company is quiet small in size and new, this decision is still reasonable since that this mobile game company is the creator of two wild spread mobile game, which earn a net income of three hundred-fifty thousand per day. Besides Soft bank, there are many other companies show interest in mobile games, including famous companies in Japan like Sega, Nintendo, and companies in America such as Electronic Arts and Microsoft. There is a clear tendency of shifting to mobile game from traditional gaming among the top companies. 
	The direct reason of why top companies keen on mobile game is the huge profit, and a deeper justification is that the top companies understand that the mobile game is a better fit for people at now days. The reason to say mobile game is a better fit for now are that mobile game are cheaper, requires less time at each time playing, and convenient of carrying and using. It is obviously that mobile game is cheaper than either PC games (personal computer games) or consoler games. Generally, the requirement for mobile game is just a smart phone, which is wildly seen around us, and the cost is usually less than ten dollars; however, pc games are usually above twenty for a game and not including the computer. Opposite side would say that smartphones and computers are both wildly spread, also the same time the cost between pc game and mobile game is not huge. This is correct indeed, but at the same time the consoler for consoler game is both not wildly used and cheap. Traditional game include both consoler gaming and pc gaming. 
	Besides the different in cost between mobile game and traditional game, mobile game also has an advantage of time consuming. Solo game (one player only game), either on computer of consoler, usually takes about 30 to 50 minutes for each single task, and multiplayer game for both computer games and consoler games requires much more time because people cannot leave their teammates easily and multiplayer task is usually much harder than solo game. For those reasons, each time a player performing a solo game or multiplayer game, he or she has to create a spare time at least 30 minutes. In the same time, mobile games are less likely to have multiplayer games and require a time more than 10 minutes, since you can back to home page and leave the game at backstage. It is true that computer games can also leave to the backstage, but it means the overall performance of the computer will be deducted. (Feijoo, Gomez-Barroso, Aguado, & Ramos, 2012) 
	Working others function with a game at backstage might be fine to the expensive computers, but there is no way to carry such a computer around like a smartphone. Mobile games are loaded on smartphone, and thus people can play the mobile games nearly at most of their spare time, without limiting of time and place. Because people will spend more time on mobile game, it's reasonable to conclude that mobile game become more important to those people and ending with more money spend by those people. Pc games and consoler games usually available only at home and easy to be limited by parents at the perspective of teenagers. 
	 Mobile game will increasingly gaining its popularity in the next few years or even decades, and the traditional gaming has nothing to do about this trend. Mobile games is surely cheaper, cost less time, and more easily to be played with. Traditional games have nothing to do to overturn this circumstance, but they can avoid competing with mobile games at those fields which are much hard for traditional games to improve, and developing in other sections for instance harder game experience which requires more key to be used, and better sight in games.

"Plastic Surgery 
People not only like the person who is pretty, but also want to be beautiful themselves. Then more and more people start to consider having plastic surgery. It's an efficient way that people are able to change their original faces or other body parts in order to improve their appearance and become beautiful. When it comes to plastic surgery, there often has sprung up a discussion. Although the surgical procedure has its negative side, having plastic surgery is worth to risk. 
Safety is the top consideration when people want to have plastic surgery. Every surgery has risks, including plastic surgery. However, with the advance of technology, the rate for death has been decreased nowadays. According to Dr. Perry, it shows that the rate of dying in the surgical procedure is between 1 in 250,000 and 1 in 500,000. In the study of surgery death between January 2000 and May 2004, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons found that the death rate has been decreased from 1 in 160,000 to 1 in 350,000 (Perry). These are very, very low mortality rates. The data shows that the rate of dying in plastic surgery is similar to the rate of dying in the plane crash. Besides, advances in surgical techniques have made the skills of plastic surgery and the medical environment get improved. And nowadays, more and more hospitals involve the best health care and treatment after having surgical procedure. So now with the better skills, better techniques and better treatment, the possibility of the death occurs very low. 
In addition, without considering about the risks, having plastic surgery can make people become more confident and more beautiful. First reason is that having plastic surgery can improve their defects. Gold can't be pure and man can't be perfect. Someone was born with defects and someone has defects on their personalities. So having the surgery can change their appearance and improve their shortcomings and let some people have better life as ordinary people. ""Let Beauty"" is a South Korean cosmetic surgery television program. This program is for the people who have beautiful dreams and pursue beautiful life. The purpose of this show is to give those people chances to become beautiful. Huh Ye Eun is one of the contestants in this show. Before she had plastic surgery, her friends didn't want to play with her and people around her bully her because she was not beautiful and she had defect on her face, as well. Then, one day, the TV program ""Let Beauty"" found her and gave her chance to talk to the plastic surgeon Dr. Park. Although Huh Ye Eun had the severe under bite and over sized lower jaw, after having the surgery, Dr. Park improved both her functions and forms and made her become a beauty. After she came back to her daily life, she was more confident to show her beauty and her friends would like to play with her. Now, she becomes a model of a fashion company and she feels happy with her life. Different from the life that they have some defects on their appearance, they all become confident and brave to make more friends and show their strengths after the surgery. After they become beautiful, they will be happiness, as well. 
Moreover, having plastic surgery can make people have better life standard. Life never favors those who always follow the beaten path and content. Instead, life saves opportunities for people who are willing and able to reform and innovate. Those people who are brave to have plastic surgery to change their appearance will have better life style. And some people also change or improve their appearance to get more opportunities in work or even find better person in marriage. One of the most popular Korean singers Kwanghee has had plastic surgery before he got into his entertainment business. ""Every time when I appear in public, I felt embarrasses when my nose made weird noses. So I decided to have plastic surgery. Luckily the plastic surgery turned out well,"" he said (Kwanghee). Having plastic surgery made him become more handsome and change his life to become famous. After he had plastic surgery, he got more fans in his singer career. Besides, because of his honesty about having the surgery, more and more people start to notice Kwanghee and start loving him. The result not only brings Kwanghee popularity but also makes him get better lifestyle. So having plastic surgery can make people have better life standard that they cannot get before. 
Plastic surgery is the enhancement of the body through surgical procedures. Plastic surgery can help people live happier, raise their self-esteem, make them more confident and give them more opportunities to go out and try something they wouldn't have otherwise. Social confidence leads to the person making contact with others, which is very positive effect of plastic surgery. Feeling good about their physical appearance and therefore starting to be more social and interacting with other people. Then people will start to make more friends and get more opportunities by themselves. All in all, although every surgery has risks, people should think about the outcomes and changes to make them be brave and if people decided to have plastic surgery, just do it. It's worth to take risks.

"Argumentative Essay Final Draft 
12th December 2015 
Technology and Employment: The Fate of Working Communities. 
Introduction 
	Technology is one of the underlying factors of today's stupefying evolution within our modern society. Ranging from transportation to telecommunication systems, everything that we exhibit presently is far more sophisticated than what people had a couple of decades ago. Technology has a profound influence on everything that we see and interact with nowadays. Ryan Barton, author of the article ""Technology's Explosion: The Exponential Growth Rate"" had affirmed that technology today had grown at a staggering rate. He added that the advanced community will only require a shorter term to develop and came out with new inventions compared to those who live in the twentieth century. However, one should not be blinded by the positive impacts of technology in this Modern Age because experts believed that it had brought few negative consequences toward the job market nowadays. First, technology had caused disruption to the structure of the occupational market which directly lead to large unemployment rate every year particularly in manufacturing sectors and service based industries. In addition, the expression ""Technology for Better Future"" is just a narrow generalization that cause many individuals failed to recognize the gloomy face of technology towards the present-day working community. 
Technology Disruption to The Manufacturing Sectors 
	With the astounding growth of world population annually, the demand for elemental consumer products are likewise escalated. Few manufacturers find this to be challenging but at the same time lucrative. Establishing new manufacturing plant both in their country of origin and overseas had allowed most of them to access advanced technologies and open up new markets for their products as claimed by Joel Backaler in the article titled ""5 Reasons Why Chinese Companies Go Global"". At this minute, robotic arms and automated machines are abundantly spotted working tirelessly in the assembly and processing lines alongside human laborers. Due to the capability of machines to manufacture low-cost commodities in massive quantity within a curtailed period, more and more companies are engrossed to assimilate machines in their working environments including large contract manufacturers like Foxconn as claimed by William H. Davidow and Michael S. Malone in the article ""What Happens to Society When Robots Replace Workers?"". This event, reflect similarities with the information shared by Mc Afee and Brynjolfsson in the article titled ""Why Workers Are losing The War Against Machines"" (Para.4) where they acknowledged that many manufacturers today seem to have more enthusiasm in automation compared to human laborers. Other than that, Davidow and Malone they both shared that Foxcomm had recorded an expansion in the number of robot installation in most of their factories worldwide particularly in China with the rate of 30,000 units per year with each robot cost around 20,000 US Dollar. (Para. 4 and 5). Although we might agree with the thought that technology produces economical basic consumer products, however, a person who loses their basic income due to unemployment will still not be able to purchase those so called inexpensive products made by machines. For that reason, technology and automation within the manufacturing sectors had and will make a large number of people being dismissed from their career, making the occupational market in industrial sectors to be more competitive. 
Technology Alter Jobs Structure in Many Service Based Industry. 
Apart from the interruption to the industrial and manufacturing industry, experts also claimed that technology had modified occupation in the service based industries. For instance, a company like Amazon had changed the way people shop today. As the online shopping outpaced the traditional method by 15 percent in value for last two years as mentioned by Betsy Morris in the article retrieved from The Wall Street Journal, ""More Consumer Prefer Online Shopping"" (Para. 4), it had caused few shopping malls to be closed as notified by Tim Worstall in the article titled ""The Shopping Malls Really Are Being Killed by Online Shopping"" (Para. 4). This situation, of course, made few of the former mall employees lose their jobs. In the same article, author Davidow and Malone had stated that new robots such as the Johnson and Johnson's Sedasys machines were deemed capable of replacing the jobs of medical doctors in the near future (Para. 10). This will certainly be a revolution to the job market in the medical fields. Equally important, <name>, <position>, alluded that technological company such as Uber and Lyft hold massive potential in replacing the role of cab drivers leading to a transformation in the structure of transportation services. Therefore, masked by staggering development in the modern world, technology had also been deemed responsible for the alteration in many jobs structure on multifarious service based industries today. 
Technology for Better Future, leads to The Rise of Citizens with Zero Economic Value. 
	Many of us might have heard the overused catch phrase, ""Technology for a Better Future"". However, one should be cognizant of the reality that catch phrase is just an inaccurate generalization set forth by innovators. As what I've mentioned repeatedly, currently, there is an outstanding figure of unemployment worldwide due to the uprising of smart machines and technology. In this state of affairs, technology today had catalyzed an increase in society with ""zero economic values"" as mentioned by Davidow and Malone in the same article (Para. 4). Since, technology create a competitive job market, people who have less skill, knowledge and experience in the most recent technology would have difficulty to land jobs. Also asserted by Mc Afee and Brynjolfsson, due to the uprising of smart machines, more employers are expecting to hire laborers that are very skillful making those people who don't to be outperformed by others. Also mentioned by Derek Thompson in an article titled, ""A World Without Work', he said ""One of the first things we might expect to see in a period of technological displacement is the diminishment of human labor as a driver of economic growth"" (Para. 14). Although most of us had witnessed that technology does create a better future such as in urbanization, medicine, and communication, but the benefits had not been able to be distributed equally among the people, which means some party will gain benefits while other do not. Therefore, with the realization of this facts, the statement of ""Technology for a Better Future"" do not entirely reflects the reality of the current situation as the number of citizens with zero economic values is increasing not only in underdeveloped countries but also in first world countries today. 	 
Opposition: Accelerating the Technology Make a World Where Nobody is Required to Work 
Apart from all of the negative consequences of technology that I had discussed, there are groups of people who have a different thought about this matter. In the interview, <name> had introduced to me a notion that opposed the idea of technology convey damage to the structure of working society called ""Accelerationism"". It is a philosophy that state by accelerating the technology to its maximum capability there will be an end to work. Also mentioned by Thompson, many futurists had been excited with the idea of ""jobless world"" where he believed that everyone will have limitless amount of leisure and freedom in life (Para.7). However, it is a na ve idea to believe that this situation will be happening soon especially with the current level of technological advancement that we have. In the same article, Thompson also claimed that the idea of a world without work will surely make many nations face complication to distribute their wealth among the public citizens which could directly lead to severe social transformations (Para.7). Therefore, it is vital for the modern community to be concern about the negative influence of technology towards the current job markets and figure out ways to overcome them immediately. 
Philanthropically-sound Effort, Minimizing The Effect of Automation in Modern Job World 
	When it comes to unemployment epidemic in the modern community, we might think that halting or controlling the development of technology would be the best way to curb this problem. However, based on the article by Keith W. Miller, ""Technology, Unemployment, and Power"", the author proclaimed that the uprising of technology should not be considered immoral despite the irrefutable fact that it had seized enormous amount of jobs within the community. Also mentioned by Miller in the same journal, some people view technology as an ""option"" while other look at them as a vulnerability. Take for example a CEO of a company will look at intelligence machinery as an option toward the increase of the company profits and productivity while physical laborers will look at them as a threat to their career. Later in the article, Miller conclude that most of us concur that technology is something unavoidable. Therefore, one of the way proposed by <name> during the interview is philanthropy. Having escalating rate in philanthropical efforts by many company and organization today will surely help to curb the unemployment epidemic. As claimed by <name> larger company such as Google and Microsoft had already been spotted to have an increase in the amount of philanthropy, showing that they were concerned with the disruption that their technology may cause towards the global society. Therefore, an increase in Corporate Social Responsibility by all company, despite their size, is actually one of the ways to curb the aftermath of technology towards the working communities. 
Digital Literacy, Key to Survive the Modern Working Environment 
	Although philanthropy deemed to be capable in absorbing the impact of technology, but the effort only act as a momentary measure. A long term solution for this affair could possibly be done through education. In the same article by Davidow and Malone, they said ""., we need a new, individualized, cultural, approach to the meaning of work and the purpose of life."" In other words, education could be one of the approach to taught new generation about the basis of life. Scott Mc Nealy also shared similar perception where in an article titled 'A Community Effort Is Needed to Eliminate the Digital Divide"" he said education is one of the ""fundamental triggers"" to resolve the digital divide within the community (Para.3). Skills and comprehensions in technology could be an asset that each individual should acknowledge. <name> had mentioned that one of the cardinal factors that had lead to this issue is the digital divide, a situation where people in different places received different levels of technology. Likewise, education held the potential to make a community or individual to be more digital literate thus eliminating the digital divide among the global community. Becoming competent in diversified skills related to the current technology could help one to be more prepared to face the challenging job market that we have today especially when it shifted from ""physical-based economy"" to ""knowledge-based economy"" as asserted by <name>. 
Conclusion 
	In conclusion, technology had changed the world that we live today. Most of us had witnessed the power it possessed and how it had affected various facets of people's life in the twenty-first century including the occupational market. The increasing amount of machination had been one of the uppermost reason that lead to the escalating number of unemployment. First, technology had been claimed to cause disruption in modern manufacturing based industries. Then, technology had also altered jobs in numbers of service based industry. Last but not least, experts believed that ""Technology for Greater Future"" is only an inaccurate generalization spread among our modern community. Notions, after notions had been proposed by philosophers to refute the negative influence of technology including ""Accelerationism"", however as claimed by <name>, it was still a puerile idea that we could hardly achieve the goals in a short range of time. Therefore, increasing philanthropically-sound efforts and refining education among the global society are some of the measures that could help reduce the gravity of this epidemic.

"				Jobs in Startups Over Corporate 
We all humans have changed so much over the past that we do things not for us or because we love it, we do it most of the times to show people. So is in the case of when looking for a job or accepting an offer. People take up jobs in Corporate World over Startups just because they don't want that if they tell someone in society about their company they should not be knowing about it. Its not a moment of proud, they are just trying to boast up. I'm sure you got to know what I am going to argue about today. Yes, I am going to argue about taking jobs in Startups over a corporate one. I'm going to support my arguments with the following points. 
	Even though the Startups don't pay as much as a corporate could pay, but the opportunities available at startups are way too much and better as it is a new company, they are going to have tethering issues and are usually small. So any problem faced in any department, it comes into notice of everyone. And this provides an amazing opportunity to an employee working there as he gets to know how to solve this and also broadens his mind. One could learn in a corporate too, but since they have separate departments and specialized employees in each of them so the issues don't become viral quickly. Where as Startups being small, everyone works together and helps each other to build the company and match the level of corporates. Next big advantage of startups you get to work with a bunch of innovators. People who think out of the box. People who think differently, who keep on looking for problems and find solutions to them. Further more one can can easily climb the ladder and take one of the senior level positions in the company which I feel is pretty amazing. Adding to it, the atmosphere present at the Startups is pretty cool. Since it is usually the young crowd in it, people dress up pretty funky, you get to talk to the generation of your age, who have similar mind sets. 
Considering the above factors, I would strongly urge everyone to consider the option of working at a Startup. I'm sure you will love it and its going to be a learning time with loads of exposure.

"Benefits of Online Shopping and Its Growing Popularity 
Online shopping is one of the fastest growing shopping trends in many parts of the world, with China being one of them. Its growth has been in terms of increasing popularity as more people are choosing to use this shopping method and others spend more money on their online shopping. Evidence of the increasing popularity of online shopping in China is shown by statistics from China Industrial Information 2015, that showed turnover of online shopping industry in the year 2014 of China was four trillion and this was the highest amount in the world p.1. Also, five years ago, Pekingese spent only 2 Yuan from the Internet for every 100 Yuan of consumption but currently the amount has increased to 16 Yuan Beijing Evening News, 2015. This growing trend has obviously come with some effects. Most of the effects are positive but there are some which are negative. Overall, benefits of online shopping have led to its growing popularity. 
To start with, one of the benefits of online shopping is that it brings convenience to shoppers Kornum, & Bjerre, 2005. In many activities of people, convenience matters a lot. This is mainly due to the natural human nature of wanting to do things through the easier option or the fact that there are so many activities to do and therefore choosing the easiest ways of doing them is the best idea. This could also be due to need to for example save on time or cost. Online shopping therefore becomes a really useful way of buying items since it offers the much needed convenience. Gong et al, 2013, P. 215 discusses this convenience of online shopping where they argue in their article that many Chinese people have come to realize that the internet provides a very convenient environment for shopping. Also, from my interview with my friend <name> , she considered convenience of online shopping as one of the most important things that drew her to try it. She said that with online shopping, she did not have to spend a lot of time going to do physical shopping in the city as she could do the shopping from the comfort of her home <name> , personal communication, March 23th, 2016. 
This convenience comes through a number of ways. For example, it reduces costs of travel to physical stores to buy the items from there and this too saves on time. This is because one will comfortably do their shopping from their house and wait for the items to be delivered at their doorstep Clemes et al., 2013, P 365. In regard saving of time, <name> also gave me an example of how after buying the mask for her father's respirator online, it was delivered much faster the following day but had they chosen to buy it from the city, it would have taken a few days to get it <name> personal communication, March 23th, 2016. Another way that convenience has been improved is that shoppers can access different online sellers of the same product at the same time and this gives them the ability to compare the different options still at the comfort of their homes before choosing which option suits them best depending on factors such as price, reviews of previous customers and so on. 
Moreover, online shopping helps people to start businesses. It has very low entry barriers such as little capital requirements and therefore anyone can start such a business easily. The businesses are of benefit to their immediate owners and also the general society as they create employment and therefore improving living conditions for many people. Under this point, there are already some of my friends who make a living from online selling and this gives them enough money to sustain their lives through school. Online shopping also helps other industries to develop. Courier services industry is one such industries that benefit from online shopping as the sellers normally use it to deliver the goods to the buyers. Insurance industry also grow as the shoppers buy insurance of their goods like <name> told me in the interview <name> , personal communication, March 23th, 2016. Growth and development of these industries help in creation of more jobs in the economy and therefore improving the living standards of people. 
What's more, the buyers are able to get a good bargain on products. In many cases, products on the online market are at lower prices from those in the physical stores. This is because the online sellers do not incur expenses such as rent for a business premises and other utility expenses. They therefore put lower prices for their products and shoppers can save on the costs. This is a really good benefit to buyers since many buyers consider price as one of the main factors before they settle for which items to buy. Good prices for the products therefore benefits them the shoppers who can now buy more products at the lower prices. 
Another benefit is that by online shopping offering goods at reduced prices to the buyers, this brings competition to the other sellers who operate physical stores such as supermarkets. This competition is healthy in any market as the sellers will be forced to improve the quality of their services or even reduce prices so that they can continue attracting shoppers. When the prices are reduced or the quality of service is improved, it is the consumers who benefit. 
However, there are a few shortcomings of online shopping. One of them is that at times, there is risk of items that get delivered failing to match the description sellers had given on the website. From the interview, <name> also stated that this is usually one of her fears of online shopping but she has managed to find ways of ensuring she buy items only from those online sellers who do not have complaints posted about them by other shoppers <name., personal communication, March 23th, 2016. Also, there could be additional charges the buyer could incur the sellers delivered items not fitting in the description of the buyer. The additional costs could be cost of sending the item back to seller and insurance costs which are not incurred when one buys from a physical location. 
In conclusion, it is evident that online shopping is of great benefit to people's everyday lives. This is terms of issues discussed above such as enhancing convenience of shopping, creating platform for many people to start businesses and also help to develop other related businesses which leads to creation of employment, improving of living standards and therefore improvement of the general welfare of the economy. Shoppers also benefit from buying goods at lower prices than in physical stores, increased competition for traditional sellers such as supermarkets who react by improving quality if their services or the prices. Due to these benefits, online shopping is therefore growing greatly in popularity as more and more people seek to benefit from it. As for the shortcomings, they are few and they can easily be avoided if people selected their sellers properly. This would ensure they only buy from sellers who guarantee the buyers that what they will deliver matches the descriptions given online and should it not match, they will compensate the buyer.

"Making American friends helps Chinese students in academic study 
Nowadays, an increasing number of Chinese students choose to attend American universities. It seems that they do well in their academic fields, as they often get good grades in the exams and quizzes. But have you noticed this phenomenon? When you walk into the libraries you will probably see a lot of Chinese students dividing into small group and study on their assignments together. But, in their groups we can hardly find an American students inside. What's more, in class discussions or group meetings, Chinese students and American students usually form their groups separately. It seems that Chinese students are prefer to talk with other Chinese students than the domestic students. About this situation, some Chinese students may think that it is not necessary to work with the domestic students, however, I think that having American friends can help Chinese students' academic studies. 
American friends can help Chinese students adapt to American ways of study. In Dan Harris's (2012) article Chinese Students In America. It's Bad Out There from the China Law Blog website, he described the American students' complaints on Chinese students that those Chinese killed the class discussion as they seldom participate in class. I think the main reason for this situation is that Chinese students are coming from a different background of education. In our classes, we are not encouraged to talk in class even if we suppose to discuss the content of the classes. But in American classes, things are totally different. Everyone is expected to give his opinion whether it is right or wrong. But, with the help of their American friends, Chinese students can do better in the class discussion. In the class discussions, those American friends can carry them in their groups. They can encourage the Chinese ones to share their ideas, help them express themselves when they cannot describe their opinions well. Also when you need some help, to ask your American friends will be less pressure than ask the professor. In this way, Chinese students can get into American ways in class faster and better. 
As the Chinese students are used to the new studying method, a new problem occurs. As English is not the first language for the Chinese, they may have difficulties in communicating with the domestic students especially for the hard academic problems. In this way, American friends can help Chinese students with those academic communication problems. In Mo Xue's (2013) work Effects of Group Work on English Communicative Competence of Chinese International Graduates in American Institutions of Higher Education, she demonstrated that group study with American can help Chinese students develop their creative thinking and improve their ability to talking and comprehension. Also, this will help them to increase the background knowledge of American culture. After practicing many times, they will be able to talk about the academic questions with their peers. It will also be easier for them to ask questions to their professors. Therefore American friends can help Chinese students improve their academic communications. 
With American friends, Chinese students will have a better group work. In my interview with my GS instructor Ms. Jenn, I asked her about the group works between Chinese and American students. She said that the both students have their own advantages. For example, American students can understand the material well and Chinese students are often good at computation. If they can combine their advantages together, their group work will be more efficient and the outcome will be better. One example about me is that, I take the Physics class this semester, and it has a lab class which need to writing codes to simulate the motion. It gives an instruction for each topic. My group is formed by three Chinese students. Because of the limit of English skills it is often takes us a long time to understand what we need to do. But for the group next to us, it has a different situation. This group is formed by an American guy and a Chinese girl. The American guy would like to explain the material to the Chinese girl if the girl seems not understand what is talking about. When it comes to the calculation part, the Chinese girl will do most of work. Because of their cooperation, although they are only two people they can do faster and make less mistakes than what we do. That's why I think have group works with American friends can be more efficient and the outcomes are better. 
Some students may thought that studying with American students is not a good idea because in this case they may need to spend more time to study together and cannot control their own time. I think this is because in China they seldom have the chance of group work. Actually group work can save a lot of time, if people can separate the work into several parts and everyone was responsible for one part. Thus, people can just finished their own in the time that work for them. After all people finished, they can determine a time to have a conference and explaining everyone's own work. In this way, the time will be less as you do not need to think about the whole thing by yourself. Also the result will be much better, as the diversity of people's ideas can help them make their project perfect. Just as the old saying said, two heads are better than one. 
Overall, making American friends in academic can help Chinese people adjust new way of study, improve academic communication, and make better group works. I think that there are still many other advantages of American friends in academic. In a foreign country, nothing is easy. If the Chinese students want to be successful in their fields, they need to try to have their American friends to help them. What's more, they should be very hard working, as they cannot let their American friends to do every single thing for them. Wish every Chinese students can have American friends and succeed in their academic studies.

"Argumentative Paper 
September/23th/2015 
Argumentative Paper 
(Introduction)As we know, America is the only country that using U.S. Customary Units, 196 countries, 98 percent of the countries in the world had adopted the international System of Units, Also known as the metric system. Replacing the U.S. Customary Units with Metric system will benefits the nation economically and educationally in a long run. 
(Opposition)People in America are adopted to use the U.S. Customary Units and that is what they have always been using. America is using the hybrid system which is using both the metric and the U.S. Customary Units in order to embrace the globalization while keep its culture. It's not necessary to change the whole system into a one universal units, uniformity is good, but not in cultural respective, and measurement system is a big part of the culture and daily habit. speaking from the experience, none of the laws and metrication movement in 1970s and 1990s went successful or even got enough attention from the public, if change a cultural symbol is operational, America would not be the only country that still using the U.S. Customary Units. The change of the current measurement system would be a struggle which costs a lot of money and time, but the government is in debt. Why should we put all the efforts and money on the units while there are lots of big problems like immigration, civil rights need to be focus. The best way to run the society is to take the necessity of each problem under consideration, then use the resources to solve the most urgent ones. I doubt the metrication would be one of the list. 
(Support)Some people are saying that the change of the current measurement system would be a struggle because it costs a lot of money and effort. However, the truth is the cost is not as huge as people thought, and the time for people to adjust will not be longer than one year if under a proper guidance. Compares to the cost of switch, The benefits of switching the units measurement is far-reaching and profound, because there is a demand for massive international trade. For instance, many routes of America start have digital road signs because it's accurate and the information can be updated fast enough to guide the traffic more efficiently. The use of digital roads sign is a trend in USA, so the cost of change the road sign will not be a matter because it's will cost none to change the units on the digital screen. The effort required for society to adopt a new measurement system is not long because the metric system is universally used in the school, so most people already have a foundation. The change of a daily habit like measurements should started with a lot of small steps, like changing the unit ounce on the water bottle to only millimeter, or starting to put metric unit on the road signs. People can learn the metric system unconsciously by seeing the metric everyday. In a word, the cost is not unreasonable, and the cost of switch to the metric system will be overtaken by the benefits gained from the change, so the concern of money and effort is unnecessary. 
(Supportive paragraph) America should use the metric system as the only measurement is because of that the hybrid system causes confusion. USA is the only developed country that has not adopt the metric system yet. One example of the misuse of the hybrid system is, In September 23th 1998, NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter because one engineering team used metric units while another used English units for a key spacecraft operation. As a result, it should have entered the orbit of Mars at 150 km but instead it went close as 57km, so the poor orbiter crushed and burned. It's all caused by the confusion of using two systems. The metric system is based on the decimal system which makes the conversion easy and reasonable. It's really handy to make conversions in metric system, by moving the decimal point right or left. All basic units use the different prefixes to show different quantity. And English units is a way harder system to use compare to metric. 5280 ft equals 1760 yard equals 1 mile, If I ask someone many yard does 100 feet equals. Nobody would know for sure unless they carry a calculator all day long. 
(Supportive paragraph)The metric system is the language of science. Not using it as primary units would be harder for American people to communicate with the rest of the world and American might be isolating themselves scientifically.

"P5D3 international student finding internship 
April. 26. 2015 
Nowadays, more and more international student choose to study in US because of different reason. Some people may think US has better education, some people may just want to experience different culture. But study is not the only thing we should do. More and more student want to experience different things during our college life, and that's why more and more international student consider having internship. Some people even want to find a job in US because they want to have different working experience. But finding internship has never been a easy things for international student. Sometimes, it may be much harder compare to domestic student. While international student facing such situation, University should do something to help international student. 
First of all, some international student have language barrier compare to domestic student because they use different language rather than english. Having language difficulty may cause international student can express themselves well. Which is big disadvantage for international student when they are finding internship. In order to have a internship, international student need to introduce themselves to company when we are doing interview. If that student is not good at using english to communicate, that student won't be attractive to the company even if that student is really skillful. University shouldn't let this happen because no student want to be jobless after they graduate. University should help international student deal with their language problem. University should give their international student more train on their communication in order to let them communicate efficient enough. For example, provide more chance to let international student talk to others, let international student know how to express themselves and let international student be more confident when they are talking to others face to face. Sometimes, have a good introduction of ourselves are even important than how well we learn. 
Secondly, a lot of International student feel psychological isolated. The original place of some international student come from have different culture with US. People speak different language, eat different food or act different way. It's easy for international student feel alone. When they feel alone, they tend to stay with those people have somethings in common with them. For example, Chinese student stay with Chinese student, indian student choose to stay with indian student. But this is bad for international student get into the society. Which means international student can't get involve the local social networking. But social networking can helps a lot on finding internship. A lot of people's first internship is introduced by their friend. Which means international student lost some chance of finding internship. Some people may point out that when Chinese student stay with Chinese student, they are not really isolated, they just have their own social network. This claim seems so true but in fact most of the international student's own social network won't works when they trying to finding a job. The reason why international student stay with international student is because they feel easier communicate with each others, they prefer to stay in this confer zone. Most of they don't communicate with americans. Which means their network don't really connected to US society, that's why their network don't work. Helping international student get in the local social network is not just international student their own job, but also university should help them. If university can provide more communicate chance and force international student to get contact with the local people. For example, university can provide more communicate party or study group make up by people have different culture. If university can help they student get in the social network, student can use the social network they get to find internship or even get in the society and american culture. 
Lastly, International student have VISA issue which make the situation even worst. Company need to pay for student's H1B visa in order to hire international student. When international student show the same quality as domestic student, company tend to hire domestic student. Sometimes the situation may turn even worst. Some company don't hire international student due to company policy or security problem, For example like some major like aerospace or nuclear engineering. Last but not least, US company tend to hire the people have the same culture with their company. Because company also have their comfort zone. Hiring a person have different culture with their company may occur some unsure problem, which means it bring risk. It might be hard for university to help student to deal with their VISA issue, but university can help student work on other's part. For example, during the career fair, provide more chance to international student and convince those company who don't accept international student to accept international student. Increase the amount of job that international student can find can always be helpful. 
In summary, international student is more difficult to find a job in US because a lot of factor, like language barrier, cultural difference, physiological problem, and VISA issue. In order to obtain an internship or job they want, international student need to work harder than domestic student. University always want their student be helpful to the society or at least can live on their own. No one want their student became jobless after their student graduate. So helping international finding job is also helping university themselves. If most of their international student can find job after they graduate, this university will be more famous. So university should definitely put more effort on helping international student finding internship.

Social media influence teenagers

Should Affirmative Action Continue in the Higher Education? 
Is affirmative action keeping us away from helping those in need? 
What is often misunderstood about affirmative action is that it gives an unconditional advantage to minorities. Affirmative action policies are those in which an institution or organization actively engages in efforts to improve opportunities for historically excluded groups in American society. (NCSL, 2014). By definition, affirmative action believes in equality and opportunities for those who are historically disadvantaged. While some believe it is not fair, it is important to remember how racial discrimination still exists today. Also, socioeconomic status, social position, and educational background of African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans in the United States tend to be lower than those of Caucasian-Americans. Affirmative action has three main strengths, and I'm going to focus in college level. It promotes diversity in colleges, helps reducing effects of racial discrimination, and closes educational gaps between majority and minority and poor and rich, which will raise educational standards and socioeconomic status of minority higher. 
By admitting diverse applicants with affirmative action, colleges can achieve diverse student body. Many colleges nowadays put a huge emphasis on campus diversity. Diversity in colleges expands worldliness. To some of the people, college might be the first time to have a real interaction with people from diverse groups. It allows people to get out of their comfort zones and interact with different people (Hyman and Jacobs, 2009). According to an article written by Sophia Kerby, ""Learning with people from variety of backgrounds encourages collaboration and fosters innovation, thereby benefitting all students. Research shows that the overall academic and social effects of increased racial diversity on campus are likely to be positive, ranging from higher level of academic achievement to the improvement of near-and long-term intergroup relations."" (Kerby, 2012) 
There is still racism in the United States society, which also appears to be in colleges. By using affirmative action, colleges admit more students of color, making racially inclusive school environments. In the racially inclusive environment, racial discrimination can decrease because students are more exposed to different races, can better understand others, and overcome with stereotypes. The reason why affirmative action helps mitigating effects of racism is that racism is not a problem that can be easily defined. It is the perceptions of people that have to change. For many people, prejudices and stereotypes lead to discrimination even if it is not intended. Without specific, numerical goals, it has been found that many people and organizations continue to practice discrimination while professing agreement with equal opportunity (Kivel, n.d.). For these reasons, policies like affirmative action is needed in order to make the environment where people of color can coexist with other to overcome and reduce discrimination. 
Lastly, closing educational gaps between majority and minority and poor and rich is significant because there are stereotypes and bad cycles for minorities and poors. For minorities, educational expectations are generally low, and it passes on generation to generation. Also, poor people tend to work rather than study to keep their livings. If we think about how public schools are financed in the Untied States, in the rich neighborhoods, schools have more grants, which means better teachers and better school systems, while poor neighborhoods are financed poorly with education. In order to break these bad cycles and stereotypes, affirmative action should be put in place so that educational gaps can close, and it can change people's attitude and thoughts towards minorities and poors. 
	Many critics who are opposed to affirmative action believe that affirmative action works as a reverse discrimination. According to the court case of Fisher v. University of Texas, the University of Texas has a policy of admitting all in-state students who graduated in the top ten percent of their high school classes. For the remainder of the in-state freshman class, the university would consider race as a factor in admission. Abigail Fisher, a Caucasian female, applied to the University of Texas in 2008. Fisher was not in the top ten percent of her class, so she competed for admission with other non-top ten percent in-state applicants. The University of Texas denied Fisher's application. This clearly cannot be called reverse discrimination. Race may be the factor of admissions, but there is never a guarantee for anything when it comes to college admissions. As long as affirmative action is put into place appropriately and kept to help in positive ways, it is not going to discriminate reversely. 
As mentioned above, affirmative action is not fully understood by many people. Colleges should make their admissions policies regarding affirmative action clear and reasonable. It is important to also raise awareness of its intended purpose and what it has done to provide equality rather than its few negative effects. People should understand why it is still needed and right for this world. Diversity in colleges, closing the educational gaps between minority and majority groups, and reducing effects of racial discrimination are something that we need to work on until people see our society not in black and white and rich and poor but as same human beings.

"Fast Food Has Been Accepted by Most People 
Purdue University 
Abstract 
The fast food has been developed and popular for decades that generates its own culture and spread it worldwide. More than just food option, fast food is affecting people from daily life to social and economic development. Most people consider fast food and this industry in a positive acceptance. However, some people consider it to blame for some serious diseases and fast-food chains also face with problems on food safety. This text would demonstrate that fast food has been accepted by most people from several aspects. Some expectation for improvement would also be discussed. 
Key Words: Fast Food Industry; Food Culture; Market Economy; Healthy Food. 
Fast Food Has Been Accepted by Most People 
Introduction 
Fast food, from the literal sense, is the concept of the food that can be served quickly and often easily packaged for take-away. As people getting on the fast track of life, they get used to have fast food. There's a tremendously strong market for fast food. In general, fast food is very convenient for people with busy lifestyles and fast-food business develops a strong marketing to make it more popular. 
Furthermore, not just the options of food, fast food has been recognized as a popular food culture and spread around the world. For example, burgers and pizza are the best-known fast food category in the US. As a matter of fact, it's a quite substantive and direct way of cultural exportation and most people accept it. 
Fast food is the of the most common food options when dining out these days. More importantly, it's far more than the food option. Most people accept fast food as part of their daily life and the symbols of cultures that varies in different regions as well. Fast food industry has been in great expansion and promoted economic growth. Although some people refuse to have fast food out of healthy concerns, in general, most people would still accept fast food. 
As for social and economic development, fast food has great influence among most people. The site selections of fast food are always located in or near malls, supermarkets and funfairs, which makes people's daily life more convenient. The fast food industry has created numerous jobs and great market value, which is beneficial to economic development. Although people are changing their fast-pace lifestyles into healthier ones, many would remain in favor of fast food. Customers expect healthier choices, and fast food business are making improvements. Overall, improved fast food would still be accepted by most people. 
Fast Food: A Modern Lifestyle 
In my opinion, with the pace of modern life quickening, people seek for a quick and productive way of daily life, who can easily get satisfied to have fast food. Usually, it only takes a couple minutes to get the order at the fast-food restaurants. Besides, fast food has various options with all kinds of flavors to satisfy customers' discerning taste. 
As for the site selection, fast food restaurants often locate in or near malls, supermarkets and funfairs. And fast food has become a popular choice while people are hanging out, especially among teens and families with children. In general, people get used to fast food in their daily life and accept it as part of the fast-pace modern lifestyle. 
The Popular Culture of Fast Food 
Another reason why people accept fast food is that the pattern of food supply can date from Ancient Rome, and has developed rapidly over the past 60 years. As automobiles became popular after World War I, ""Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant, generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet and first hamburger chain"" National Public Radio 2002 
Fast food has different versions with growing popularity in common worldwide. And this is substantive and direct way of cultural exportation. For example, Japanese sushi has been increasingly popular and people get to know tatami and ""Omurice"", together with Japanese culture. As in UK, conventional fast food used to be renowned for fish and chip, and food from other culture also has been adopted. People accept fast food as a kind of popular food culture and always connect the food with cultural background in different states and countries. 
Business Success: Fast-food Industry and Chains 
The fast-food-industry can keep the price inexpensive to attract more customers. And they target teens and children and family as their main customer groups and spend billions on advertising to make fast food more popular. There are many instances of successful business marketing. Fast-food restaurants often offer regular flavors with the occasional ""limited time"" ones and the giveaways of limited edition. For example, Mc Donalds always launches kids' meals with fancy toys to attract children and their parents as well. (Allegretto, Jacobs, Doussard, Graham-Squire, Dan, & Thompson, 2013) 
Fast food overall has seen strong growth every year since 2009. And it's reported that fast food is expected to record a value CAGR of 3% at constant 2014 prices in the forecast period, to reach sales of US$246. 6 billion in 2019. (Country Report: Fast Food in the US from Euromonitor International) The success of the fast food business reflects that people widely accept fast food as part of their life. 
Opposition: Fast Food Affects Health 
Despite fast food being increasingly popular, there are still many people who blame some healthy problems like obesity on it. There's an article that reviews on the relationship among fast food, energy and obesity to find out whether fast foods are linked to the epidemic of obesity. The research finding suggests that the food with high energy density would down-regulate our ability to maintain energy balance, which is called ""passive over-consumption"". And this disturbance would gradually lead to weight gaining. According to the composition data, most of fast foods have an extremely high energy density. Therefore, the high energy density of fast food would disorder appetite control systems of human bodies, and hence to cause obesity. (Prentice, & Jebb) As news reported, Taco bell, one of the most famous fast-food companies, once put an emergency recall for microbiological contamination with E. coli. However, as for food safety, the bad events would persist and affect the way people perceive fast food. 
A research group found out that food contains excessive industrially produced trans-fatty acids, the high intake of which is quite relating to the risk of obesity and may gradually leading to other serious conditions. From those perspectives, some people stop eating fast food for health. The other part of people may turn fast food down because they want to support local restaurants instead of big fast-food corporations. 
Rebutting: Fast Food with Healthy Offerings 
However, it would be improvable for fast-food chains to reduce portions to normal sizes and eliminate industrially produced trans-fat, and offer food menus with reliable nutritional labeling as well. (Stender, Dyerberg, & Astrup, 2007) And one way for fast food restaurants to help reduce obesity is some customer surveys show that people visit fast food restaurants a little less and tend to eat at fast-casual restaurants. (Consumer Reports magazine: August 2011) This indicates that speed is still an important factor, but people tend to consider health factor when choose food. There are various substitutions to get a healthy diet, like changing for low-fat sauce. Offering food menus with reliable nutritional labelling, especially in calories, can also help customers know what they can get. In regard of customer demand, many fast food companies have responded with healthier offerings and improved services. 
As for food safety, good streamlines, qualifications of employees and food processing are the basic assurance of food safety, essentially. Fast-food companies should have strict safety control on primary food ingredients and food processing. Overall, fast-food business does have issues on food safety but so far with few outbreaks yet. Moreover, there are public displays of fast-food chains to show people every steps of how fast food is made. It's convincing for the guarantee of food safety. 
Conclusion 
Based on the successful business model and its own advantages, fast food has been very popular and accepted by most people worldwide. More than food option, it's also recognized as a food culture and also has been affecting people from daily life to social and economic development. Although faced with many problems at the same time, most people still choose fast food in acceptance and expect changes for the better. The companies are supposed to make a rebalance towards a healthier diet. In conclusion, although fast food has several aspects to be improved, people are still widely accepting fast food and expecting changes for the better.

"P4D1 Argumentative Essay 
April 16, 2015 
Prosthetics and its Developement 
	With innovation occurring at an unprecedented rate, the world has seen the invention of many different technologies and devises that were once subjects of fictional and sci-fi movies. The virtual display devise that debuted in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine which very closely resembles the recently released Google glass. Similarly, fully functional prostheses that could be controlled by nothing but the wearers mind were devises that we would expect from a Star Wars or Star Trek installment are about to become a reality. With a feeling of dissatisfaction among amputees due to the drawbacks of the prosthetic devises available to them, researchers are trying to invent devices that overcome the shortcomings of the older ones and give the user full function of the prosthetic limb. 
The dissatisfaction is mainly caused because amputees are having to use more energy and effort to complete simple chores in their day to day lives because of the prosthetic limbs that they use. According to Whiteman (2014), ""The additional energy and the wear and tear on other parts of the body create a host of medical problems for the amputee."" This is mainly observed in patients who have lost a lower limb. They have to spend more energy as compared to an intact person to do simple things, even walk the same distance. This leads to increased pressure applied on the amputee's stump due to his weight and the cup itself due to a host of other problems arise. While this is one major area of development being worked on, another area of development that is a major interest of various research labs is providing the amputee with sensory information from the surroundings and let him control the device with nothing but thoughts just like he would do if he had his natural limb (Whiteman, 2014). 
Providing the amputee with real- time sensory information from the surroundings is not as easy as it may sound as it involves the interception of neurons in the brain that allows the impulses traveling through the neurons to be then processed by the use of computers as told by <name>, Ph D student at the Neuro Prosthesis Research Lab in Purdue University (personal communication, March 29, 2015). The idea of intercepting neurons to receive and send information from the body originated when it was discovered that ""neurons were almost like electrical wires"" said <name>. The only difference is that electric wires carry electricity in the form of voltages and current while neurons carried information to various parts of the body in the form of impulses. One of the labs that aims to create ""realistic robotic arms, legs, and hands that not only move like the real thing but also ""feel"" sensations like pressure and heat,"" is the Neurophotonics Research Center which is trying to create a link compatible with living tissue to establish a two way communication between prosthetic limbs and the human nervous system using powerful computer technology and fibers embedded with thousands and hundreds of sensors (Epping, 2010). 
While discussing the topic with a friend of mine, he argued that such developments that involve expensive technology in simple devices such as prosthetic limbs is not worth the effort because it will increase the cost of the device for an average user making it unaffordable for him. I thought this question was an interesting one and when I asked <name> about it, he said ""The way I would see it is like using a computer back in 1990s. Since I was born in the 1980s, I didn't see a computer until along time because it was really expensive back then. But now, it has become very affordable to own one"" (personal communication, March 29, 2015). This might be the case with prosthetics too. Although at first they may be expensive to own, over time cheaper and efficient methods of manufacturing may make it a very affordable commodity in the market. To help the research in this field, <name> pointed out that there have been enormous funds for this area of research especially from the US Defense to help war veterans cope with lost limbs and other injuries. With development in fields such as design and manufacturing, the production of prosthetics can be made a lot more efficient which could also make the cost effective. One of such manufacturing technologies that may help do this is Rapid Manufacturing. 
Rapid Manufacturing is a process that uses computer aided design to manufacture and construct parts of or the entire prosthesis itself and studies have shown that such advancements positively influence the field of prosthetics. Using the job characteristics model, which evaluates the changes in the skills and job satisfaction of employees due to the application of new technology to traditional manufacturing processes, Wagner et al. (2008) have done a study that has evaluated the effect of introducing Rapid Manufacturing, which fundamentally changes the manufacture of sockets, to the field of prosthetics. Rapid manufacturing (RM) according to Hopkinson et al. 2005 is defined as ""the use of a computer aided design (CAD) based automated additive manufacturing process to construct parts,"" (as cited in Wagner et al., 2008). RM is an emerging technology having significant potential due to its capability of creating cost effective, custom-fit prosthesis' without the use of manual tooling while reducing the time of manufacture. However, the introduction of RM will led to the deskilling of technicians involved in manufacture of prosthesis which leads to highly qualified, skilled staff to seek out opportunities to continue working (p. 6461-6478). 
	To conclude, there has been a lot of research that has gone into creating prosthesis' that not just replace a lost limb of an amputee but also fulfill all of its functions including its sense of touch. With the present scenario concerning the available prosthetic devices, many amputees are not satisfied with what they have available. This shows that there is a lot of development that aims at making prosthetic devices more ""lifelike"" is required in this field. This is a mutual feeling among many amputees that there is a lot more that can be achieved in the field including creating artificial limbs that can ""feel"". With the invention of devices that can connect man and machine, many opportunities for their application will open up including letting an amputee control his prosthetic devise with his or her mind. With research labs being able to produce working prototypes of brain- machine technology and the purpose for which this technology will be used, I see a great future for such technologies. With prostheses allowing users to control their artificial limbs with just thoughts, amputees will be able to live their lives with much less burden and more efficiency.

"Dressing skimpy is not guilty 
Due to the argumentative cases of sexual harassment happened in metro in June 2012, there was a debate on dress code of victims. The operator posted a picture of a woman in provocative dress with words ""It's not surprise some people wear in revealing attire get harassed."" This event started a flame war on the Internet. People were separated by two opinions. One group of people agreed with the operators' idea. Nevertheless I am on the side of the other people who judged dress code isn't the excuse of sexual harassment. 
Male in pants are also victims of sexual harassment so female victims can't be blamed on dress code. Beiner (2007) elaborated this idea in her article Sexy dressing revisited: Does target dress play a part in sexual harassment cases? To prove her idea, I find a more powerful and direct evidence; the data of Sexual Harassment Charges FY 2010- FY 2013 from U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which shows average 15 percent of charges filed by males annually. The statistics determined that males who are not in skirt, bikini, and laces are also the victims of sexual harassment. This means a woman in provocative dress isn't a factor leads to sexual harassment and people cannot censure the victims for what they wear. 
With the male cases, dressing conservatively cannot fully guarantee zero sexual crime. In other words, if people consider dress code as a reason of sexual harassment, then like the statement posted on China Daily (2012), ""According to this logic (dress code leads to sexual harassment), all men can harass women in swimming pools?"" The answer is definitely ""No they can't."" No mater a woman wear, her dress code is not an offender' excuse to hurt her. A person has the rights to choose his or her dressing style and it's law allowed. And harassers are the people who break the law so that general public shouldn't blame victims. 
To analyze the cases of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and women social classes have more impacts on sexual harassment. India, considered as one of the countries, which cases of sexual harassment happened most among the world. There was a significant case in India called 2012 Delhi gang rape. A girl was raped by six men in a private bus and died. A court in South Delhi accepted and heard the case. And the finally judgment is death penalty. However, before the cases got the court decision, there were nearly 8900 cases like this in India, which had not been judged. Cases of sexual harassment in India are usual. One of the reasons is the gender discrimination in India is a serious problem since ancient India due to the caste system. Though the government abolished the caste system in 1947 but it still exits. Women in India have low social classes and general public even government does not take their rights seriously. And the caste system that was a historical issue still influence people's thoughts on gender discrimination there. Take Ingonia, a remote village, as an example, women with the surname of Nats live in that village which is also called village of prostitution were living by dancing for the nobles. With the revocation of caste, women there lost their means of living so they have to prostitute themselves. As this case, we can see that women in India have low social classes, which easily lead to sexual problems. Comparing to sexual discrimination, dress code is not a big deal related to sexual harassment. 
As the actress Kathleen Turner said, ""Being a sex symbol has to do with an attitude, not looks,"" no victims should be blamed by their dress code. And if people condemn them for what they dress, the issue of sexual harassment will refer to gender discrimination, which is exactly one of the factors results in sexual harassment. Though there are several ways to protect us from sexual harassment such as avoiding being alone, accusing harassers, asking others' for help, the original measure is to change people's thought on sexual harassment. It's hard to be realized nowadays but I believed the situation will become better and better.

College students are encouraged to take internship as soon as possible. 
Each student wants to make as much effort as they can in order to succeed, not only during their time in college, but also after their graduation. In order to fulfill their potential, some students choose to take an internship during summer or winter break. This is simply because they believe that the importance of internship cannot be ignored. For numerous benefits that internships provide, college students can take full advantages and apply these advantages wisely in the future job markets. Therefore, college students are encouraged to take internships as early as they can. 
The importance of internship 
The importance of internships should not be underestimated. Nowadays, the internship has enjoyed the high popularity in many universities. There are increasing large numbers of institutes, universities expend their major program into internship, and students are often encouraged, even required, to take internships. In fact, according to Gilroy (2014), companies are seeking for potential employees who have tried one or several internship during their college time, stimulating more schools to put internship in students' graduation requirement. This is simply because companies are no longer seeking students who only have a high GPA. I found a concrete example of the benefits of taking an internship in my expert interview with <name>, a Ph D student who explained how companies value internships. <name> noted that students who had internship during their college time were more likely to win the opportunities in job markets (Tong, 2015). He also emphasized that without his previous internships he would have never gotten his current job (<name>, 2015). Based on these examples, both Gilroy's research and <name>'s experience, it can be seen that internships can play and important role in the careers of college students. 
Benefits of internship 
Moreover, the benefits that internships provide can also lead college students to future success. There are lots of benefits that internships provide, like professional skills, salary that companies provide, and network with internship's companies. By taking one internship, students can enjoy these benefits at the same time. According to Greer (2013), most internship would help students determine which specific area they want to work for in the future. This is beneficial because many students with certain majors still do not have clear images of what they want to be or where they want to work. With this practical resource of help, they will have some ideas about future occupations and working environments. From <name>'s example, he compared his experience in Mc Kinsey to full time position, discussing his daily tasks, like morning conference, assigned work, and checking off work list. It is not like what he did at school. In the internship, <name> learned valuable social skills that cannot be learned in school. Compared to school, the internship experience is more crucial because it taught him how to be a successful networker. After all, he admitted that it is little boring to take this routine work, but he does not hate his job and it is totally fine if his future job is like this. Based on his experiences, it is better to take internships early and be competitive in the future job market. 
Internships bridge the classroom to the workplace 
Some people may claim that it is better for college students to take internships at their junior or senior year instead of freshmen and sophomore, as they have acquired enough knowledge and can work effectively as they join companies. However, this is not a comprehensive idea. Internship plays a role that connects classrooms and jobs. During the internship, students still can learn some interpersonal skills, acquire professional knowledge, and handle with the real world problem, which they will never learn when professor is giving a lecture. Furthermore, learning never ends after the classes. By taking the internship as early as possible, they can have opportunities to try to deal with these problems, practice what they have learnt in class, and find out their individual skills and goals (Coco, 2000). If students were to take their internships early, they have the ability to apply the knowledge they learned throughout their college career; however if internship opportunities are presented at the students' junior or senior year, they might not have the chance to apply what they learned from their internship. For the major, construction engineering and management, at Purdue, they require students to take internship every summer as their prerequisite for higher level courses. With more and more students get jobs after they graduate from this major, it clearly shows that students should take internships as early as they can. Therefore, there is no reason for students to expect to begin internship in their senior year. The more internship you take, the more working experience you will get, and the more chances you will win in the future job markets. 
Conclusion 
To sum up, college students should pay more attention to internships, take full advantages of internships, and try to take internship as soon as possible. Today, companies are looking for people who have valuable internship experiences. Internships are full of benefits, such as professional skills, salary, and network. More importantly, internship is the bridge between class and the real world. For students to become successful in the future, it is recommended that they take internships as early as possible.

The Dependency of Korean Economy on Conglomerates 
	In the previous interview, it has been stated that there is no monopoly in the Korean economy but it was also proven that the economy heavily depends on the conglomerates. It was quite obvious why Korea had no choice but to rely on the conglomerates instead of forming a reliable income source. Is it evident how bad Korea is relying on these conglomerates to the point conglomerates are all that Korea has? There are multiple data sources stated below that prove that the Korean economy is relying on these conglomerates too much: the distribution of income, the population hired by these conglomerates, and their income compared to the national income. 
	Korea had good reasons to rely on these conglomerates as Korea itself has nothing to export. The natural resources are poor as well as tourism. The regions are mountainous for agriculture and the land too small to do anything. In such environment, the formation of chaebols conglomerates could have been the best choice. It is time to question the decision made back then. Now Korea has grown overly attached to these conglomerates. With such dependency, some sort of internal change was destined to happen. The first thing that happened was the distribution of income. With conglomerates being the base of the economy, it is quite obvious that anyone working for these conglomerates would be in a better spot than others who are not. In a small land with 50. 22 million people and few conglomerates to compete to get hired, the wealth distribution is dramatic. By 1992 standard, top 10% of the population takes more than 40% of total income, top 5% of the population takes more than 30%, and the top 1% takes 14.2% of wealth Leipziger. P. 57. From a more recent source of information, the top 10% of the population possessed 46% of the country's total wealth. The bottom 50% possessed only 9.5% Koo, Hagen. ""Inequality in South Korea"". Paragraph 9. Such difference of income is unacceptable. Of course, there will be few in the upper limit that makes far more money than others but this almost makes it seems like people in the lower half are doing nothing to get money. 
	The inequality of distribution of wealth seems evident, then how much population do these conglomerates feed or hire? In 2010, 9 conglomerates employed total of 757634 people accounting for approximately 1.51% of the national population Hubpages. ""Younger Generation. Conglomerate Companies"". Does this seem much? No it does not at all. In fact, it almost seems like the effect of the conglomerates quite menial with such low number as 1.51%. Let's put some other factors in to the calculation. Assume each employees support a family of 4. That is a little over 6% of the total population. Take other conglomerates that was not mentioned in the above information; that will make up may be 7% of the population. 7% of the population fed by less than 20 conglomerates. If companies that are under these conglomerates were to be added, it will easily make up 10% of the population. That is quite impressive considering how few companies are feeding 10% of the national population. Still, the numbers presented here does not seem very relevant to how 10% of the population makes 46% of total income. After all, the actual working population of these conglomerates are maybe higher than 2% of the total population. Well here is some information that allows everything to make sense. In 2010, 5 conglomerates Samsung, Hyundai Motors, Lotte, SK, and LG accounted for 55.7% of Korea's GDP Global Sherpa. ""Korea - Country Profile, News and Original Articles"". That is 5 conglomerates making up more than half of the country's wealth. Account other conglomerates that was mentioned above and it would easily make more than 70% of the country's wealth. With the conglomerates employing around 2% of population while making more than 50% of the nation's wealth, it is safe to assume that these 2% are definitely included in the top 10% that makes 46% of the total income. 
	From the data above, I claim that Korea's economy is too dependent to the conglomerates. As proof, the conglomerates makes more than 50% of the total income while employing only about 2% of the total population. Such concentration of monetary flow cannot be seen as good. If anyone were to say that Korea does not depend on conglomerates, I would ask them to explain how 5 conglomerates account for more than 50% of Korea's GDP. As Korean myself, I see this issue getting more and more evident as time flows. The few who are employed by the conglomerates are the only ones who can live a stable life while others can only dream. For this situation to improve, the government must stop caressing the conglomerates for being the base of the economy and focus more on smaller firms. The solution will not be immediate but just by decreasing the dependency on conglomerates the problem that has been mentioned will improve significantly. This is an issue that has be pointed out and should be solved within the nearest time possible.

Promoting League of Legends at Purdue University 
Technology is changing many aspects of our lives, including the way we study, the way people interact and socialize. E-sports is one major benefit of technology that is now the modern way people play sports or enjoy leisure away from the fields. League of Legends (LOL) has now become the dominant game in the ""E-sports"" (Electronic sports) among students. Unlike the critique states that this E-sport based game has negative influence upon students. I believe it is a good idea to market league of legends at Purdue University so that many students can enjoy this game and familiarize with it. 
The League of Legends has many benefits and it is important to promote it in the university. League of Legends is a game that will be able to organize students. The number of students who engage in LOL across the nation is large. Therefore, it is expected that students at Purdue University will enroll in large numbers. Buzz feed news by Joseph. B (2013) proves League of legends popularity by given the data that LOL has 70 million currently registered players, and, within this number, college students occupy 60 percent of entire population of gamers quantity. Add to the number that the players' age between16-30 is 85% of the total LOL gamers, which can assume that they either currently studied in or graduated from college. The huge enrollment is anticipated to bring positive value because it increase social skills and allows students to be organization using a different platform. This is a positive benefit because it is a social factor that has positive effects. 
Aside from the large quantity of students engaged in LOL, League of Legends promotes the electronic media, which is a critical aspect of the society today. The way technology is changing, it seems that soon people will be using online platform to study, work, and execute other things. Therefore, encouraging the e-sport is a good thing as it provides students with an opportunity to understand the online platform better (Greenfield, 2014). This is an opportunity to sharpen skills and familiarize with digital technology, which is the future. Students at Purdue University should be encouraged to use e-Sports in order to be familiar with electronic media, which is applicable in academic. 
LOL and electronic sports enhances studio and performance at school. This MOBA type of games does bring positive effect to the students. Although critique of LOL in Universities have argued that this particular games have no positive effects on education and to make it worse, they argue that the game is harmful to students which rejected by the article (The effects of video games on school achievement) that I personally agree with. The article argues that there is a correlation between gaming and study performance (Voulgari, Komis, Sampson, 2014). Playing games and other co-curriculum activity is an important part of life, and student needs to be all-round in order to maintain high performance. Playing is part of learning and it keeps the mind fresh, which eventually helps to boost academic performance (Fiske & Taylor, 2013). The researchers collected the data from the survey, which proves that players have develop different level of abilities, from language, typing or speaking to the concepts of virtual world economy.(Freedman, Pringle, & Yalden, 2014). The data also indicates that players have develop great amount of the teamwork skills, which is crucial in this day and age because the extent of collaboration with teammates can determine the ultimate results. 
However, LOL could be destructive to Purdue University. Focusing on the online games can result in negative behavior as many of the participants will engage more in sports and forego learning, but again, no evidence has shown that the promotion of online game will directly lead to poor study performance. It could be a destructive move to promote LOL because playing games online is likely to interfere with social skills because people will only engage in e-based platforms. In addition, this can adversely affect learning because players will engage in games for many hours. 
The promotion of LOL at Purdue University will help boost communication skills, teamwork, and learning. More so, e-sports such as LOL will help students to organize themselves in large social groups, which will go far in addressing academic and social life. I believe promotion of LOL at Purdue University will bring positive outcome to the student gamers.

"	 Argumentative Essay Final 
December 9TH, 2015 
The Influence of Hip Hop Dance to People 
My topic is about the influence of hip hop dance in people's lives and I have researched about it in different perspectives to specify it. Hip hop dance is becoming increasingly popular in today's society as young adults are more willing to seek out and join hip hop dance clubs. Some educators are even considering allowing hip hop dance classes, as they believe it will enrichen campus life and strength students' bodies. My position is that hip hop dance could bring many benefits and change a person's life in a positive way. 
Hip hop dance could improve people's body system and bring people a healthier life style when they do hip hop movements regularly. From my previous interview, many dance movements need certain muscles, so people usually do variety training in order to strengthen and tone those muscles. (<name>, personal communication, October. 8TH, 2015) Also, it is a good way for dancers to develop the sense of balance when dancers make a series of movements. (<name>, personal communication, October. 8TH, 2015) So I think that hip hop dance is really beneficial for muscle at first. Then I learnt that dancing could improve health system to fight against diseases and prevent disabilities, ""The health benefits associated with a comprehensive physical fitness program may also be achieved through dance. The aerobic fitness component of dance improves the strength and efficiency of the cardiorespiratory system and reduces excess body fat, which plays a major role in the increased risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease,""(Ward, 2008). Dancing is an efficient exercise to improve body quality, especially for those who are diabetic and even some hospitals use dance to help the disabled recover. Therefore, hip hop dance can illustrate people's life greatly and enhance health quality. 
Hip hop dance could shape people's characteristics and develop abilities which are beneficial for future. According to Johnson(2011), the hip hop dance influences characteristics of young people. Hip hop dance battles allow dancers to get together and develop team spirit through fighting for their dance studios' reputation. (Johnson 2011) Hip hop dance also stimulates these young dancers' innovation. Adults enjoy the advantages that dance brings, but elementary students as well enjoy those advantages. Battisti(2011) summarizes that some educators allow students to have dance classes and these students benefit from dance classes a lot. Dancing can help young children with social, mental and emotional abilities, and even their future direction as, ""Creating exciting and productive classes to inspire future artists is the first step to introducing dance education,""(Battisti, 2011). 
Hip hop culture can have advantageous influence on youth and the development of society. From my research, the quantities of benefits indicate that it would help lead people to a bright future. There is an interview that talks about how hip hop dance can help people understand science, which will promote children's study and society's development. In this interview, it is stated that, ""We have all types of educators who come on board, and they talk about using hip-hop, you know, in understanding engineering and technology as well as all types of lessons, including the social sciences and language arts,""(Lee, 2013). Therefore, students can learn a lot from those hip hop lessons. Many young people build confidence about themselves through hip hop dance as well. There is one article that talks about how one tiny community travelled to teach Inuit youngsters about breakdancing and hip-hop culture. According to that article, ""More important, they also instilled a sense of confidence and self-worth in the youths, many of whom come from troubled homes,""(Seilstad, 2015). 
However, some people hold the opinion that hip hop culture may impact young students in a bad way, for example creating a distraction from studying. However, from evidence previously stated, I believe that hip hop brings more long-lasting advantages versus disadvantages. People could learn a lot from hip hop and improve themselves. People could overcome those little difficulties on their own if they have enough persistence. 
In conclusion, hip hop dance has taken up an important position in today's society. Under people's modification and improvement, it will bring people benefits on physical, mental and social levels. Not just youth, all kinds of people can develop themselves through dancing regularly.

Breaking The Stereotype: Lack Of Women Engineers 
Every now and then we see debates on which side of the gender is better in science and engineering. And from my personal experience, it is always the males that are thought of as the better between the two in the field. But is this argument even valid? Are women actually lacking in capacity to take on engineering position? The answer is - No! As a matter of fact, women are equally competitive to men. They have gone to the very top of an organization and held pivotal positions, for example Mary T. Barra (CEO of GM) and Indra K. Nooyi (CEO of Pepsi Co Inc.). If these women can be the top personalities, why not others? 
Strangely, it all started from the time we humans were born. Right from the stone age, we know that men used to go on hunting and women used to take care of children. As the tools were fairly simple at that time, men invested a lot of their time in developing strategies and traps to get food. This improved their logical part of the brain more. Does that mean women lack logic? Definitely not! But as females were reduced to maintaining households, it became a trait of the gender. Children grew up knowing males will go hunting and women in charge of cooking and house. 
As the time passed, the roles did not change. Comes the industrialization age, where men go on to work and women, as usual, taking care of home. It was obvious to have more men engineers at that time therefore. And ever since, it has been men who dominate the work force, until lately, when the female decided to earn for themselves and stand in this world on their own two feet. Not only engineering, we started seeing more women entering into the job market in every sector. But it is true that we have very few women going into engineering and instead going into other job sectors. Presently only about 18 percent to 20 percent of engineering students being female women (Crawford, 2012). 
Why do women not look at engineering as a fascinating job? I shall discuss the problem to you but first let me iterate why we need women engineers at the first place. Are men not getting the job done? They are definitely on top of their work, but the thing is, different gender brings different perspective. Also, only women can describe the things that will make their lives better and come up with their solutions. Female brain is known to be more creative than male. So bringing that creativeness into the industry is really important, especially that now there is so much competition in the market. 
Now that its established why more women engineers are needed, let us see why we are lacking in their numbers. My extensive research on this topic could only come to one conclusion that women are equally competitive and skilled as men are when it comes to engineering, it is only their thinking and thought process that makes women think they are not capable or otherwise deters them from this industry. According to Mr. <Name>, a post-doctoral research associate in psychological sciences at Purdue University, it is only a 'psychological disbelief' present in society that women cannot achieve success in engineering which holds them back from becoming engineers. He explains, ""Men think that women are not as competent as them in Engineering, although this should not affect women psychology, but as women are brought up in this mindset, it makes them feel less confident of their own skills. This is the reason when it comes to choosing a career, women feel more confident in non-engineering disciplines"" (Aue, personal communication, 2016 March 3). As we can see here, the environment that women grow up in makes them think they are not competent and they never value their own skills, and rather undermine their skills. Women start believing that engineering should be left on to the other gender. 
Some studies claim that differences in brain structures between the two genders is the reason why we see less women in the field. I must approve that there are minor differences in brain structures and how the two genders use their brains, but in no way does this incapacitates women. Mr. <Name> explains that, ""Differences in brain functioning is seen in how the two brains process information. Women tend to store the information as such, whereas men try and break down the information into logical patterns. But psychology plays a much greater role (in choosing engineering)."" So even though there are differences in male and female brain structures, it doesn't explain quite enough why less women look upon to engineering jobs. 
While talking to my peers about this topic, they suggested that maybe women do not find engineering a fascinating workplace, and this is why they do not think of going to that field. I definitely believe this might be true. But then how do men find this field interesting and women do not? The only possible explanation I can think of again is the thinking that women hold. ""Women believe engineering is a very challenging field for them. Although engineering is definitely challenging, but it is equally intimidating to both genders. Women just have less confidence on their skills and so naturally take less interest in it"", explains Mr. <Name>. If we combine this with the fact that women are aware of the belief in the society that male are superior to them in engineering (which is not true though), we can easily see why women do not find engineering any interesting. 
These were the two major arguments that I have come across after my extensive research apart from the one being why we need increased women engineers, which I have already addressed in the beginning. And all of these arguments can be easily explained by the simple argument that I have presented i.e. it is only a stereotype and misbelief held in the society. Moreover, we can easily fix this problem by creating awareness and soon maybe a woman turns up with an amazing engineering marvel, who knows!

Drug Testing in School
Drugs are the biggest problem facing America's youth today. There are many tools being used to combat this problem. One way is by drug testing adolescents in schools. Random, suspicion less drug testing is a common sight in America's high schools, and is becoming more and more popular. When used appropriately, this can be a useful tool in the fight against drugs. Unfortunately, there are too many problems facing random drug testing in schools. Although random drug testing has good intentions, its benefits do not outweigh the damages it does to one's privacy, its economic impact, and the fact that it is not all that effective.
One of the biggest issues with random drug testing is the invasion of privacy. The fourth amendment of the constitution guarantees the protection from unreasonable search and seizure by the government. This applies to all citizens of the United States. However, during the case of The Board of Education v. Earls, the Supreme Court ruled that students that attend public high schools have fewer rights, and even less for student-athletes, than regular citizens when it comes to searches and seizures (La Croix). Does this mean that high school students and student-athletes are not equal to any other United States citizen?
The process of drug testing itself is very embarrassing to a high school adolescent. The most commonly used test for a high school student is the urinal test. For the test, the one being tested is under close scrutiny by an official. For girls, the official has to hand them a cup and follow them into the bathroom and stand outside the stall and listen while they fill the cup. It is even more embarrassing for boys. Officials hand them a cup in the bathroom and actually watch them urinate into the cup. Although this does help to ensure its accuracy, it is very uncomfortable for the adolescent being tested.
These tests are also embarrassing for the ones being tested because they often require the examinee to reveal personal information about what medications they are taking whether for a physical or mental disease. When they reveal what medications they are taking, they then reveal what conditions they are being treated for. This breaks the private patient confidentiality that is held only between the patient and their physician. This kind of information can be very private and sensitive and would have otherwise been unknown to anyone else if the teen being tested was not forced to give the information.
The results of the random drug tests are supposed to be very strictly confidential to help protect the integrity of the one being tested. However, often times, the results of these tests are found out by people other than who needs to know. One of the most obvious ways that the peers of a student with a positive test find out is by the mere fact that they stop attending any extracurricular activity that they were being tested for. The random drug testing requires that the results of the test are kept confidential, but there is no requirement about the confidentiality of telling anyone else that someone is going to be tested. When somebody finds out that a peer is getting tested, and suddenly, without explanation, stops attending the extracurricular activity, it can easily be assumed that the test was positive. Another issue with confidentiality is that the test results are frequently just left lying around. Making sure the results are kept secure ""may be hard to implement within a school setting, yet unless schools are able to guarantee the security of such systems"" (Mc Keganey). Anybody can find and read the results of the tests in this case. Also, officials are not always trustworthy with the information they obtain.
An excellent example is in the case of Jonathan ""Zach"" Montoya. Zach grew up and went to high school in the small town of Los Alamos. He was a student-athlete all four years of high school, maintained excellent grades, and was one of the most athletic students at the school. He stayed out of trouble and was very involved in the community, but because of his great athleticism, he was subject to drug testing often. Because of the high frequency of tests, he eventually came up positive. The problem was that he never took any illegal drugs; there was just a mistake in the test. Eventually, word got around that he did not pass his test because ""in small towns, everybody talks to everyone else, and some people just cannot be trusted with that type of information"" (Montoya).
Furthermore, drug testing high school students has problems with consent. Most high school students are under the age of 18, so the school must seek permission to drug test from their parents. Parents are not universally supportive of drug testing and their policies. If a parent does not give consent, then the child's standing with the school may be jeopardized. Random drug testing policies usually consider a student to be positive if they do not take or refuse to take the test even if they are completely clean (Mc Keganey). This is not fair for the student. The student should not have to suffer the consequences if it were their parents' decision. The student is then being punished not for something they may have done, but for what they did not do; which is not under their control in the first place.
Another major problem with random drug testing in schools is the cost of the tests. The cost of drug testing in schools is outrageous. In fact, it is so expensive that ""the cost of testing is likely to exceed most schools' entire expenditure on drug education, prevention, or counseling"" (Gerada). There are many types of drug tests. The most common, and less expensive compared to the rest, is the urinal test. This test usually cost between 14 and 30 dollars for the initial, indicative test. If a test comes up positive, there has to be another, confirmatory test. Confirmatory tests usually cost more than the original, indicative tests. These tests are only used for drugs like marijuana, cocaine, and amphetamines. The more expensive tests are for performance enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids. Since steroids are harder to find, the cost of these tests are significantly more ranging anywhere from 100 to 200 dollars.
Dr. Robert Dupont is an expert on drugs. He graduated from Harvard with a medical doctorate degree, was the first Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse from 1973 to 1978, and was the second White House Drug Chief. Dupont says that the average ""annual cost of school drug testing programs range from $1500-$36,000 per school"" in the United States (Mc Keganey). This is a significant drain on schools' already scarce resources. Where does this money come from? It comes from the same place that schools get their money for anything else, tax payers' money. It is not fair to make citizens of the United States pay for the random drug tests when they do not affect them in one way or another. Plus, most of the time the tests do not even find anything.
Random drug testing is ineffective due to its problems with accuracy and that it is not a very good deterrent from drugs. Accuracy of random drug testing is constantly under question. The problems with the accuracy of tests fall under the category of false positives, and false negatives. False positives occur when a test result is positive, when in reality it should not have been like in the case of Zach Montoya. A false positive can occur because of what the one being tested has consumed like food or medications. That is why test subjects are forced to reveal what medications they are on. Even common over-the-counter drugs can cause false positive results. Products like codeine produce results similar to opiates, decongestants produce results similar to amphetamines, and even ibuprofen can be confused with marijuana. Not only do these students have to be careful of what medications they take, but they also have to be careful about the food they eat. Even simple poppy seeds and herbal teas produce false positives. Poppy seeds are easily and commonly confused with opiates (Evans). Herbal teas are worse and can be mistaken with almost any drug depending on what type of tea was drunk.
False negatives pose a problem as well because they are tests that result where drugs have been taken, but the test was unable to find out. False negatives occur most often because the sample is too diluted and the concentration of traces of illegal drugs is below the threshold of detection for the initial test (""False Positives.""). On top of this, each type of drug test has its limitations. For example, urinal tests are usually only effective for a period of about 30 days, while tests like the hair test do not work until a few days after the drugs have been taken.
http://www.hair-drug-tests.com/main.asp
Another issue that can produce false positives is the way the samples are stored. Especially in school settings, it can be hard to store positive indicative tests for further confirmatory testing. Over time, mediums like urine can lose its potency to produce a false negative in the confirmatory test. Also, poorly stored samples can easily be tampered with; which brings up the problem with flat out cheating. There are many ways to cheat these tests. Just by Google searching ""passing a drug test"", over 900,000 hits came up in less than a second. There are easily obtainable methods that adolescents can find on the internet. One way of cheating a test is by substitution. The lucky students who are not embarrassingly being watched urinate by an official can easily pretend to urinate into a cup while they just pour somebody else's urine in that is clean. For hair tests, if the student knows that it is coming, they simply just have to shave their head, suspicious yes, but they will pass the test. There is even a market that specifically deals with passing random drug testing. The products that are sold are masking agents. These masking agents, called ""Detox Kits"", are consumed by the person being drug tested, and then they are all the sudden ""clean"" rendering the tests useless.
https://www.goldenneedleonline.com/index.php?page=products2&letter=&pg=16&id=5296
One of the reasons that random drug tests are implemented is because it deters students from doing any drugs. However, random drug testing is not as effective as other methods of drug prevention and can even be counterproductive. The best way to prevent drug abuse by the school is to create policies ""that address key values, attitudes, and perceptions [because they] prove more important in drug prevention than drug testing"" (Yamaguchi). Drug prevention programs are important because they stop the problem before it even starts. Improving knowledge about substance abuse also correlates with reducing substance abuse. The North American Journal of Psychology did a study on this and found a significant improvement with the attitudes of abusers. They surveyed the students about their use and knowledge of illegal substances before and after they installed a substance abuse curriculum. They found that after the program, ""36% of users stated that participating in the program already had reduced their use of drugs and 26% of users stated it had reduced their use of alcohol"" (Gatins).
The most unfortunate part about drug testing is that it may actually be counterproductive. One cannot throw out the idea that a positive result is what some adolescents want. Having a positive test may increase the status of a rebel to the eyes of their peers. In this case, drug testing may be the cause of some drug use, which is the very reason they were designed and used in the first place. Random drug tests can also be counterproductive because it prevents participation in an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities like sports are one of the best ways to keep adolescents safe. They keep students under controlled, safe, and monitored environments that promote health and social growth. When this is taken away from a student because of a positive test, they are pushed away and made to feel like an outcast. They are then more inclined to do drugs and other harmful activities because they are not being monitored and are not learning healthy skills.
Random drug testing for sports may drive some students from even beginning to participate in extracurricular activities. One reason is because they do not want to be falsely ""labeled"" by their peers. Since tests commonly produce false positives, some students are afraid to even be tested. Therefore, they do not even try out for extracurricular activities and are easier susceptible to drug use and abuse. Also, those who are already taking drugs that nobody knows about already will be driven away from extracurricular activities because they do not want anyone else to know that they are using drugs. This is unfortunate because if they are already using, then a positive test may actually lead them to get help. However, since they are afraid of being caught, they will not participate and therefore not be subject to the drug testing. The drug testing in this case is counterproductive because if there were not any testing and the student joined the sport, than they would learn important life and health lessons.
Overall, random drug testing should not be mandatory in high schools. It is too invasive of one's privacy and is very embarrassing. It costs too much and is not all that effective in the first place. Its intentions however are good and should be commended for that, but it is just not the appropriate solution to the problem. There are many other cost efficient and effective ways to keep adolescents off of drugs like educational programs designed to inform students about the problems with drugs, which in turn usually improves their attitudes about drugs as well. In the future, if random drug testing policies are improved to address these issues, then they should implement them. However, for today, they are just not working.

The change of vocabulary between new and old SAT test 
Introduction 
First of all, SAT has been used by Universities for a long time to examine how well 
the students understand the passage, writing skill and vocabulary, so SAT is one of measurement tests for high school students to take and their scores will relate to their college admission, the main change of new and old test is that vocabulary section has been cancelled, students only have to remember limited vocabulary to understand articles to finish reading section. In more specific way, one type of questions that students need to fill out the sentences with difficult and uncommon words has been deleted. However, new SAT test will require students to remember all the meanings of those multi-meaning words which they may use to understand article in reading section. Main argumentative point of this essay is that the change of vocabulary between new and old SAT test have what kind of effect to test takers. Many people like many test takers and their parents have positive opinion about the change which help them decrease the pressure, but still some people disagree with the change with their view that the change will increase unfairness and cause unnecessary issues. This topic has been discussed for long time, in my opinion, the change has both positive and negative effects, but positive effect is greater than negative effect. 
Resource 
From Kelly Wallace who is working in CNN, ""New SAT brings anxiety and 
confusion."" argues that new SAT will makes students may feel nervous. However, article also maintains that ""Gone is the vocabulary section, where you had the feeling you encountered words on the SAT that you would never see again in your lifetime"". Vocabulary section has been cancelled, but students still need to memorize every meaning of multi-meaning words that are common and close to their future courses in order to finishing other parts of test. 
Although changing looks like perfect for students, some people have opposite views that new SAT will hurt Some worry that could end up hurting students who have not been exposed to a great deal of reading in their lives or students who live in low-income areas or don't speak English as a first language. According to this article, writer states two perspectives towards change. First, new SAT help students decrease their pressure which have positive effect. Second, new SAT will cause anxious and enlarge unfairness. However, I disagree with second opinion, because new test may cause anxious but it won't last too long, also, unfairness have already existed and you can not expect keep still to eliminate unfairness. If we want to solve issues, there must be something we need to pay, increase a bit unfairness is worth cost in order to solving vocabulary issue. In general way, positive effect is greater than negative effect. 
In one of related journal ""The SAT has officially become a swear word in my 
mind"" written by Amanda, Chan. Author points out that old SAT have significant issue about irrelevance, students have to memorize those uncommon words that they never use and they may not use them in the future in order to fully preparing old SAT test and passing exams. Students who are willing to reading a lot in their daily lives have stronger base about vocabulary and reading. Today, parents can enroll their kids in a Kaplan course, hire private tutors or even a ""diagnostician who will classify your child as learning disabled and therefore eligible to take the SATs without time limits."" Which indicates the irrationality of old SAT test. This article mainly discusses the weakness of old SAT test, but in last part, writer also hold the view that unfairness will always exist which means we cannot avoid it. In other words, author wants to use more impressive way to show readers about the disadvantage of old SAT vocabulary and how important the change is which supports my viewpoint that change has positive effect towards most students. Furthermore, when new SAT test come out, those tutors cannot get similar sample questions to help students prepare, in some cases, new SAT decrease unfairness cause by students' background. 
Also, in other related journal written by Terrill, Scruggs and Mastropieri, they 
mainly assert several good ways to remember SAT's vocabulary to those students who have learning disabilities. The First point of journal is Keyword method, which means remembering several keywords to simplify the process of memory. Second, linking the picture with words, because research has proved that people can remember image with words more effectively. Third, widen mind about the picture, what else can be related to those images, this will help remember a large number of vocabulary. Finally, retrieve the answer, label difficult words with easy words and remember them together that may make difficult thing become easy thing. Although this journal sets the target as students with learning disability and only mentions the solutions to the problem of remembering vocabulary which is not direct related to my argument, but there is no doubt that the reason someone wrote this article is memorize the old SAT vocabulary is too difficult for many students which proves that change in vocabulary section is really necessary and has positive effect. 
In another article ""How Important is Vocabulary for the new SAT?"" author 
write lots of details about changes. From the sample and description that she offered, we can easily tell the main difference is that remembering these words might have different meanings in different situations, so you want to make sure that you understand each word in all of its dimensions and applications. students can do this by finding a word used in several example sentences, rather than just one, as well as noting how vocabulary words are used when you read books, articles, and the news. Article concludes that students need to change their studying method from ""lists of ""2,000 SAT vocabulary words"" (phew!)"" to ""multiplemeaning words of medium-level difficulty."" This article mainly discuss the change of test affect studying way without any strong attitude, but I insist the view that change will help students decrease worthless work which is remember uncommon words, and do more meaningful thing, so change has positive effect. 
Conclusion 
	From all the view points and reasons, I state the opinion that change cause positive effect because students can acknowledge more useful words during preparation of SAT. As for the negative effect, students may will nerves about new test, but it won't last so long. Also, someone mentioned increasing the unfairness, based on my explanation, that unfairness will decrease because everyone doesn't know what kind of questions they should prepare, so hiring tutors can offer limited help to them. I can easily draw the conclusion that the change of vocabulary between new and old SAT test has positive effect.

The Yulin Dog Festival Should Be Suspended 
In June Solstice which day Yulin people think as the hottest day in the year, Yulin people organize their own traditional festival called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival and entertain their family and friends with wine and dine. During the Festival, Yulin people will slaughter over 10,000 dogs in total for eating Li 2015, para 1. This phenomenon provokes the anger of animal protectors so that they go to Yulin, try to stop the Festival and let the whole society know the Festival in order to suspend it. Therefore, the Festival attracts a lot of attentions from the society. A part of people who eat dog meat think this is good because they can enjoy delicious foods; other part of people who love animals think the festival is cruel; Yulin people think the festival is their tradition; animal protectors think this festival is inhuman and should be stopped. From where I stand, I think the Festival should be banned for humanity, suffering people's hearts and human health. 
First and foremost, people like my friend <name>, who eat dog meat, announce, ""There is no difference between eating dog meat and eating pork, lamb and beefpersonal communication"" and ""Cows work hard on farms ploughing the fields, you insult Hindus by eating cows and Jews by eating pigs - how dare you then judge us for eating dogs Dog/cats vs. farm animals, para. 1?"" However, I disagree with these statements. Cows are the partners of farmer, so lots of farmers do not eat beef because they respect their friends and partners. Same as cows, dogs help people a lot. Seeing eye dogs help blind people to guide. Search dogs help firemen to search those people under the shambles after earthquake happened. Police dogs help policemen to crack a criminal case. Pet dogs accompany with elders to spend their lonely time. They are people's friends and partners. People who get helps from the dogs do not have the heart to kill them and eat their meat. Therefore, eating dog meat is not acceptable. 
Besides, some people think I do not eat the dog of yours, so it is not on your business. In fact, the festival and eating dog meat is suffering people's hearts. A picture on the Internet touches lots of people's heart: The girl was just five years old and she lost her pet named Flower; one day she found her beloved pet was died outside the dog meat stall. She touched her pet corpse and cried.

What did she think when she found her pet corpse? Did she find how delicious the dog meat is? Was she happy that her pet would become a dish on others' table? The answer is no. She would think why people kill her pet and hurt her heart; she would think why no one has a little guilty when they did this; she would think why this happened on her life; she would think why people satisfy their own desire by hurt others. It is too cruel for the girl to realize that her Flower would never come back. It is harmful for the little girl's development because she experienced the inhumanity of the society earlier than other children. Remaining shading in her mind, she may be scared to contact this world in the future since she had already been hurt by the inhumanity from people. 
	Last but not least, people who agree with the Yulin Dog Meat Festival think the dog meat in the Festival is safe and legal. In fact, according to the girl's picture above, it is not hard to find that her pet dog was lost and killed, and the corpse appeared outside the dog meat stall. It is suspected that her pet dog may be stolen by someone and sold to the stall. In deed, the origin of the dog meat in the Festival is unknown yet. Peter Li points the problem out that ""China's food safety regulations ban the processing, selling and serving of products from diseased or dead animals of unknown causes. And yet the Yulin authorities seemingly ignore these rules, allowing dog meat from unknown sources to be sold to consumers, and in so doing prioritizing the profits of dog meat traders over consumer health Li, Food Safety Disaster, para 2-3."" This shows that the dog meat in the Festival and eating dog meat have potential dangers for human health. In addition, in Yulin, the dog slaughters kill dogs on public, and they exposure the meat on the air without any storages and protections. This will lead the bacteria grows and spread out quickly with high temperature summer. Therefore, the food safety is a huge problem of the Festival, and it will bring some unknown and serious problem for human health.

	In conclusion, I firmly believe the Yulin Dog Meat Festival should be banned. Considering suffering human's hearts and healths, based on humanity, the Festival is not acceptable to continue. To consider human ourselves, if the Festival continues, more and more people will lose their dogs, and more and more people will be suffered by the unhealthy meat. If the Festival is suspended, people will live in a safe environment.

"Argumentative essay 
Nowadays, the demand of steel is increasing. In this case, many factories around the world try to increase their production function to make it more efficient. To achieve higher efficiency, factories should use more electric arc furnaces instead of other kinds of furnaces. By the combination of three articles, Purification of Post-consumer Steel Scrap, science, Potential for Steel Industry Energy Intensity Improvement: Electricity Use in Minimills, it is easy to come out the idea that the increasing usage of electric arc furnaces. Also, factories are reducing percentage of contaminants and increasing the kinds of reinforcement because of the demanding requirement for making new machines. 
To begin with, there are three kinds of furnaces used in steel production. They are basic oxygen, open hearth and electric arc furnaces. Among all of them, open hearth furnaces cost too much energy when producing the same amount of steel compare to other methods. For this reason, they had been abandoned since 1980s. However, since 1970, when electric arc furnaces were introduced and installed in factories, the efficiency had increased by large amount. Most of scientists and engineers found the advantages of electric arc such as less pollution produced and less energy cost. According to Bruce Hannon and James R. Brodrick's opinion, for actual production, 55. 6 percent open hearth, 32. 6 percent basic oxygen and 11. 9 percent electric arc should be used to achieve minimum energy (485-491). However, the idea related to open hearth is incorrect in recent years because most factories in developed countries have abandoned open hearth furnaces. Open hearth furnaces are furnaces that can burn out carbon and other impurities from pig iron to produce steel. 
For the first reason, electric arc furnaces can be used because they only require electric power for electrolysis. However, the other two treatments need large amount of heat to burn out contaminants and to melt pig iron to produce steel. Since electricity has more energy efficiency than that of burning fossil fuels, factories should try to use more electric arc furnaces to produce steel. According to the research done by Dr. Andreas Opfermann and Dirk Riedinger, the energy transfer to the chemical is roughly from thirty percent to sixty percent (3). Although the energy efficiency for basic oxygen furnaces is slightly higher, roughly 75 percent of total energy input, the total energy used to heat the pig iron is greater than that used to electrolyze it. Also, the introduction of oxygen may cause the production of carbon monoxide, which counts for air pollution in global scale. 
In addition, electric arc furnaces tend to have more intense energy in processing. In industrial production, the highest temperature in the middle of area that is receiving high energy electrons is more than three thousand Celsius degrees. It is flexible in producing steel because this method can move contaminants out easily such phosphorus and sulfur, two major elements that greatly affect the machinability of steel produced. Also the temperature of the whole furnace can be controlled easily because the heated region is so small that could not change temperature of whole body by large amount. On the other hand, basic oxygen furnaces are hard to control since most of the heat input comes from oxygen lance. The heat has great influence on furnaces, making it easy for shoddy furnace to explode or break into pieces. For this reason, factories should use better materials which are difficult to be oxidized and robust at extremely high temperature when build furnaces. This procedure indirectly changes the efficiency for new oxygen furnaces. 
On the contrary, Bruce Hannon and James R. Brodrick thought that using basic oxygen was a good way for consuming less energy. They stated that more than half of steel should be produced by this method to achieve greatest predicted and actual efficiency. This idea is wrong because technology has improved recent years. More and more factories are increasing percentage of electric arc furnaces because of mature controlling techniques. Also, the cost to run a program of electric arc had decreased a lot since 1970, when it had been installed. 
Overall, factories should use electric arc furnaces more to produce steel. Although many steel production companies still use basic oxygen furnaces to produce steel, most of them will shift to electric arc production in near future. If more factories choose to use this kind of treatment, more energy can be saved for civil using.

How should parents self-question during the education process? 
Children are the future of the family and their parents, so education has become one of the most important part of a family. I believe most parents want their children to grow up into healthy and smart people. As we all know, children not only learn course book knowledge at school but also learn other abilities after class. In most of time, the after school activities is decided by the parents. For example Amy Chua, the author of ""the battle hymn of the tiger mothers"" is famous for her way of education towards her two daughters. She made almost every decision for them including forcing them to play the violin. This made great argument in education. So how do parents make their decision becomes an important and interesting topic to think about. After a number of interview and articles reading, I've got a suggestion of ""Parents need to self-question when they are educating their children."" 
The first point to question is ""Find a balance between parents and the children"" What balance? The balance between parents' hope and children's interest. It is true that parents will consider about the future more than children, and also it's true that parents know what is better for the children. But we also know interest is an important thing for children in learning a new thing. Parents should not force children to do what they don't want to do, but find an activity which is good for both sides. Maybe it seems difficult but actually don't. Something like sports or art will be a very good choice. For example at the interview with my professor <name> , she never force her kids to learn something and her kids can do freely in their sports and flute playing, but when meeting the kind like learning language, which is really important, she will ask the kids to learn and tell them why it is important. Her kids can working on their interests and important abilities. The result is, her both sons are not only concentrate on what they like, but also learn the abilities which will be very important for them, more important, they are glad of this happen. 
The second point to question is ""Have enough knowledge to decide which is right for children"" When making a decision, how the decision maker's thought decide how the decision will be made. Whether the decision is good or bad, it all depends on people. If a people have higher education or have high level of thinking, he or she can make better decisions than those who don't. As a survey which is made by a couple of German educationist, students who get high scores usually have high educational parents. When they have questions to ask their parents for help, their parents can more likely to give a good idea for them. Because they know more and can understand where the problem is. Some parents they have the mind of helping their children, but they cannot give a good idea for them, this also influence the decision making. 
The final point to question is ""Have an attitude which will encourage children?"" parents themselves need to have a positive attitude. Children are young and can be easily moved by their parents' mood. If their parents said ""no I don't think this will working"" or ""I'm not sure if you can do this"", most children will also agree with these negative thoughts. ""My mom said it may not success."" or ""Dad told me not to try because I' m not good at, maybe he's right."" This will take the chance of trying new things away from children, if they don't try how they will know if they can do it or not? If the parents have the mind of ""why don't you just do it?"" ""It's okay if you fail because mom will always be with you"", then most children will bravely make their first step to the success. For example, when Isaac Newton was young, he didn't get good marks and all his classmates said he was a fool. But Newton's mother think this is not true, and teaching him classes by herself at home. At last Newton became a successful scientist. If his mother also thought her son is a fool, she will not keep helping him, and Newton would believe he will never become successful. 
If parents can think clearly of the three points above, they may make a good decision for their children. Education is not just for children, it also need parents to make progress in their own thoughts. Children are young, they need their parents' help. Most parents love their children and want to help them, but how many of them really helps? Sometimes parents really need to think about this question: ""Am I helping my kid to the way of success or just killing his interest towards study?"" If parents can clearly ask this question, it's not hard to communicate with kids and made a good decision for everyone in the family.

"How students choose their college major
Liz 2013 put forward that students should be prohibit choose their major until second year. He said first year students are most likely making uninformed choices when they determining their major. Students are most likely not developmently prepare their future major before they become a freshman. He said first-year students are still attempting to understand their own identity. In other words, making a decision about choosing a college major is very important for student. Cultivating professional skill in college helps students became competitiveness when they are finding job. In addition, an unsuitable college major will influence their career and life. They may hold negative attitude on their jobs. In my opinion, I think students should choose their college major according to interest.
Firstly, there is great relationship between college major and future job. John (2006) mentioned the mismatch between college majors and occupations. However, from the table in his article, it shows that Fifty-five percent of individuals report that their work and field of study are related. In this case, students should be careful when they choose college major. It is definitely that students don't want do something boring for them when they study in university. What is more, a boring major also means colorless work. More over, college studying is mostly for laying a solid foundation for future job. Students usually study a field knowledge, which is related to their future job. Therefore, studying a interesting college major is very necessary for students.
Secondly, some scientific college major test is based on interest. Shatkin (2011) mentioned a scientific test for helping students choose a college major. He consider that personality type, skills, and favorite high school courses is primary factors that should be part of the decision. There is not difficult to find that these factors both according to interest. Moreover, when I interview my advisor <name> She said there are some survey and test about choosing college major in CODO website at Purdue. All tests in CODO, these tests are based on interest. In light of these findings, interest is an important factor for finding a suitable college major, which means attracting you and you are good at these fields.
Interest is generally consider as a good vehicle to study and provide necessary impetus for success. Choosing college major from their hobby and their interest obviously could make students happy and satisfied when they are studying. Take my roommates <name> <name> and <name> <name> as an example both of them choose their major according to interest. In this case, they have maintained enjoyment for their major. If enjoyment is studetns aspired, I consider that choose their major from their interest is most sensible selection. Some students choose their major according to profit. Maybe, they will make lots of money after they graduate from university. However, money is not equal to happiness. Individuals who are seeking happiness and freedom, choose college majors according to interest is accurately choose. Taunee B (2014) bring forward that many people are suffering from "" Comfortable Misery"". Many people hate there job, but love the income. Income can't bring people enjoyment. If students doesn't want to become these miserable people, students should careful consider there college major according to happy.
Objective speaking, young people should pursue their dream. However, Dream shouldn't relate to money. I mentioned a lot of evidences before. Because students' college majors are related to future job, which will influence their afterlife, students should choose a suitable major. And a suitable major always based on your personality and interest. In this case, choose major according to interest is best selection leading to happy.

"Win at innovation 
I can tell that maybe you are using i Phone now. Are you still using i Phone 4 or you have already changed to i Phone 6? I am still using i Phone 4 honestly because I think there are almost no differences between these two versions of i Phone except the performances isn't it? Every i SO system upgrade gave us lots of new functions and creations of our i Phone that made us feel we bought a cell phone that never become old thing. The thing that make Apple popular every year is the power of innovation. As for the first smart phone, i Phone is the best symbol of Apple's creative power. Nowadays, people are all fancied by Apple's products. We looked at our i Phone every day on the buses and subways and it changes people's life becoming new office tools and even educational tools. Yes, through the official statistics, there are about 1 billion i Phone users in the whole world. All changes happen because of Apple's creation of electronic devises. The key factor that make Apple successful is the spirit of innovation. 
We all know that Steve Jobs once said in his speech in Stanford: ""Stay hungry, Stay foolish"". The meaning of it is that we should learn things whether they are important or not every time and always stay foolish about them to make better innovation. I knew Steve Jobs well since I read about the biography of him. Steve Jobs never stopped learning new things and innovate new things. One story I want to tell is that when Steve Jobs was in his college time before he withdrew it, one of his favorite classes is art design. Actually he never registered for that class. And it seemed nonsense to take an art design class for Steve Jobs. But Steve Jobs persisted in taking that class for a long time. He believed anything he learned was useful in the future. And then, what we saw the typesetting design of our Macbook and i Phone is based on this art courses. Another story in the biography is that when Steve Jobs was working with the creation of Macbook, he was confused by the problem of power plug on the laptop. As most people experienced before, some times when we carelessly tripped by the power wire on our laptop, our laptop will fall off from table because of the wire. Steve Jobs innovated the magnetic power interfacer to solve this problem. And it is based on the design of rice cooker from a Japanese company. Steve use the rice cooker's design of power interfacer for reference and innovated it to the new function of Mac Book. As we can see, Steve Jobs as the spiritual leader of Apple, knew the importance of learning and innovating since he was young. And it is the spirit of innovation that lead Apple go through the tough competence of electronic market and stand on the top of the mountain. 
How Apple keep Steve's spirit running through it? Well as I said in the examples in the beginning, Apple never stopped innovate things for every new version of i OS system. For my personal experience, I begun using i Phone since high school, and it was i OS 4 in that time. The first upgrade of i OS system for my i Phone was the jump from i OS 4 to i OS 5. I found Siri born in my i Phone. I could open up any apps, ask to call someone or search for restaurants and theaters near by with just talking to Siri, and she will execute that order immediately. And then, the jump from i OS 5 to i OS 6 also impressed me a lot. The change in calendar system and email bounding system made me feel more convenient than before. And I found I can synchronize data from my i Phone to other Apple devices. Finally, Apple company announced that they will make a biggest change of i OS system after i OS 6. Then, the jump from i OS 6 to i OS 7 shocked me. The whole system changed to a gorgeous brand new thing. The smooth color and new functions made me feel pleasant. Every new version of i OS make innovations. And with the power of innovation, it made people think i Phone never becomes old but younger every time. It made more people think i Phone is worth to buy. With the successful advertisement, i Phone can tell their innovation to everyone and that becomes the reason i Phone is so successful. 
Apple also shows innovation in their marketing strategy. My friend once told me that Mac Book's electronic performance is bad. But now I can told him that Apple never rely on electronic performance to win the market. The secrete strategy Apple use to occupy market is the binding of every Apple's products. According to the book called ""Marketing Strategy, Text and Cases"" written by Michael Hartline, In Part 5, it mentions the marketing strategy of Apple. It says that Apple binds their products more and tighter to make consumers buy more. The example is if we just buy an i Phone, then we can't explore all the functions unless we buy a Mac Book. The reason is that Apple made more devices that bind together can work together more conveniently and efficiently to people. And the binding strategy make more and more consumers jumped into this black hole and keep buying products that bind together like i Pad and i Pod. Apple's innovation of marketing strategy also lead them to success. We can see other computer companies like Microsoft and HP. They went through traditional computer marketing strategy designing their products' electronic performances higher and higher. We can say that most people love computers that have high electronic performances. But the innovation of Apple Company also lead computer market to a new road. And Mac Book even surpass the average sales volume of computers in the whole world. So again, innovation make Apple company successful and also make progress. 
After we talked about how Apple went through Steve Jobs' innovation spirit, I think we should look at a little bit negative way that Apple use to get the idea of innovation. The i OS Jailbreak. Every person who used i Phone knows i OS Jailbreak. It should be an illegal thing to use. But the important thing we should know is that Apple is actually cooperating with Jailbreak teams. From the news that Apple hiring ""Comex"", Peter Hajas, and even hold up Jailbreaker's meeting in London, We can see that although Apple was still standing against Jailbreak and Hacking activities, they also appreciated these illegal Hacking activities to provide new ideas of innovation to Apple's own products. The example is ""Cydia"" designed by Freeman. He unlocked the restriction of App Store, and made more programming elite create their own apps freely. The i Phone owners download much more apps from Cydia than App Store and use them, test them and find new ideas that Apple never figured out before. Until April 2011, Cydia's annual benefit has already reached 10 million dollars, and there are 4. 5 million people using Cydia every week. And almost every 10 i OS devises have one devise that installed Cydia in the whole world. Cydia somehow increased the demand of i Phone and bring tons of new ideas for the innovation of i Phone. Then Apple learned to accept Hacking and i OS jailbreak. They even asked to change the laws of electronic security. Apple becomes a company that accept the activities of Hacking and i OS jailbreak. The smart step Apple walk on leads the company making better innovations than other companies. 
Another Steve Jobs quote is ""Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower."" It reflect both people and companies. A man who is innovative become leader and a company that knows the importance of innovation also becomes leader of other companies. Nowadays, computer companies, cellphone companies even business companies all treat Apple as model. A company will be successful with innovation. Steve Jobs becomes the greatest leader of Apple Company because he loved to learn things and innovate them to new things. And then it become the spirit of Apple company.

Confucian teaching methods 
If you ask a Chinese who is the most famous teacher in Chinese history, I think most of them will tell you: Confucius. Historically, Confucius discovered and applied many his own teaching methods to teach his students and as a result, helped his students made a great progress. However, here comes a question, can we still take advantage of Confucian teaching methods nowadays to enhance our teaching efficiency and quality? As far as I am concerned, I suggest that we can still apply these three Confucian teaching methods to the contemporary pedagogy. In this research paper, I will first give a brief introduction of the three most famous Confucian teaching methods ""Yin cai shi jiao"", ""You jiao wu lei"" and ""Wen gu zhi xin"", then analyze how Confucius applied these three teaching methods historically and finally I will give supports to my argument that why we can still apply these three teaching method to the contemporary pedagogy. 
First of all, let's have a look about the definition of these three Confucian teaching methods and how Confucius applied these teaching methods historically. From He Xinyu's article, ""Yin cai shi jiao"" means using different teaching methods to teach different students according to their personalities, characteristics as well as family and education backgrounds. (1) In the history, Confucius divided his students into different groups according to their education backgrounds and attitudes of study etc. Regarding different groups, Confucius would use different teaching methods to teach. For example, some students had strong education background but were easily self-satisfied. As a result, Confucius was always figured out their drawbacks to motivate them. However, when teaching some students who was lacking confident, Confucius would usually praised their achievement to encourage them. Confucius use different methods to let students with different characteristics to make a progress. 
Second, according to Wang's article, ""Wen gu zhi xin"" means that we can enhance our understanding and getting new thoughts from reviewing the knowledge we have already learned (2). Historically, Confucius always asked his students reviewing what they learned to enhance student's understanding of knowledge points. For example, once a time, Confucius taught his students how an emperor set a law to govern the country? The first day, students only understood that the law were set based on the political needs. However, the next day when students review this policy and re-thought about it, they understood that the deep reason was because the need for the economy need. By reviewing the knowledge again and again, Confucian students learned more in depth than before. 
Third, from Bai's article, ""You jiao wu lei"" means teachers should treat their students equally regardless their backgrounds and personalities"" (1). As Bai said in his article, Confucian students have different family backgrounds. Some of their families are rich or own great powers and some of them are too poor to pay the tuition. However, once Confucius decided to teach a student, Confucius would use same attitudes and efforts to treat them no matter what's their backgrounds are. 
After having a brief recognition and knowledge of these three teaching methods, next I will illustrate why I think that we can still apply these three teaching methods to the contemporary pedagogy. 
First of all, the reason I suggest to apply ""Yin cai shi jiao"" to the contemporary pedagogy is because different students have different characteristics and education background, thus teachers should use different teaching plans to improve the teaching efficiency. For example, facing a student who is enthusiastic with studying, teachers can give him more freedom, because he will engage himself in studying without teacher's supervision. But, if you have a student who do not like studying, in order to teach them knowledge, as a teacher, you should explain why learning is important to him first and then give him more supervision. Meanwhile, if a students do not have strong knowledge background to the courses you teach, you cannot teach him using the same method like other students having strong knowledge background, or they could not follow you and as a result, waste his time. Thus, teachers should teach students using different teaching methods according to different student's features. Only when teachers do this, can we really enhance the teaching efficiency. 
Second, the reason I suggest to apply ""Wen gu zhi xin"" to the contemporary pedagogy is mainly because I believe that human intelligence is limited, thus, students need reviewing to give his brain more time and opportunities to think and understand knowledge points in depth. As Wang said in his article, ""Nowadays, we can still encourage and help our students to review what they learned to let students improve their understanding of that knowledge. Just like teaching a mathematical formula, the first time when you teach students, they may just understand how to use it. But, when they reviewed it and thought carefully, they might understand why this formula is right. What's more, when they reviewed this formula the third time, they may understand the relation between this formula and other formulas. Again and again, each time when students reviewing, they will get new knowledge and new thoughts"" (2). Just like the example Wang gave in her article, I think ""Wen gu zhi xin"" is a good method to enhance student's understanding of knowledge. Thus, we can still apply this teaching method to the contemporary pedagogy. 
Third, I also suggest to apply ""You jiao wu lei"" to the contemporary pedagogy. As far as I am concerned, treating students equally regardless their family background is a teacher's responsibility. As a teacher, you should be responsible and use your full effort to treat all of your students. I think each student is a part of a teacher's job, thus, if a teacher want to be responsible to his job, he should be responsible to all of his students. I did an interview with a history professor Zhou Hong in Beijing Normal University. Zhou argued that responsibility is an essential factor to measure a teacher. If a teacher is not responsible, the teaching quality is not guaranteed. Thus, she mentioned, students in her university will be asked whether they feel be treated differently by a teacher at the end of each semester by using a questionnaire. Her university conducted this research in each semester to guarantee teachers treat students equally and be responsible to all students. (Zhou Hong. Personal Interview, 26, March, 2016). 
Up till now, I have analyzed why I think that we can apply these three teaching methods to the contemporary pedagogy. 
However, I also acknowledge an opposite opinion regarding to apply ""Wen gu zhi xin"" to the contemporary pedagogy. From the internet, some people argued that the updating of knowledge is very fast nowadays. Thus, we should focus more on learning new knowledge instead of using time reviewing knowledge. Regarding this argument, I suggest that the updating of knowledge is very fast nowadays. However, I also held the opinion that the updated knowledge is based on current knowledge. Thus, in order to learn the new knowledge, we need to be familiar with and have a good understanding of current knowledge at first. This means we should use our current knowledge lay a foundation for our further learning and then learn the new knowledge. Since reviewing can help us enhance the understanding of old knowledge and contribute to the learning of knowledge, thus, we still need to apply 'Wen gu zhi xin"" in the contemporary world. 
All in all, based on above analysis, I think we can still apply these three Confucian teaching methods to the contemporary pedagogy in order to enhance the teaching efficiency and quality. All of these three methods are still have their values nowadays. However, in order to apply these three teaching methods, we still have a long road to go. First of all, we need enough financial support. Because in some areas, schools do not have enough fund to hire more teachers in order to apply ""Yin cai shi jiao"". One teacher should face a lot of students and as a result, do not have time to set different teaching plans. Second, the supervision to teachers is also needed. Schools should use different methods to supervise teachers and let them treat students equally and use efficient teaching methods. Third, I think we should also give teachers some explanation to let them understand why these three teaching methods are valuable and then they can apply these three methods to the pedagogy.

"Argumentative Essay Draft#1 
Who is beneficial from the Crashes 
Nobody could have failed to notice the fact that 2015 Chinese stock market Crashes is becoming a vital role in investors' daily activities. Since it happened, the outside media and economists kept analyzing the situation of Chinese and international economy. However, from what I researched for the past three papers, I realize that the underneath truth which most of people ignored - who is beneficial from this economic crisis ? Investors? Government? Local economy ? Other countries? Based on the curiosity to this question, I gathered lots of supporting information. 
At the beginning of hypothesis, I felt confident with the point of view that other foreign countries would gain the merits. As we can imagine, Chinese economy was impacted form the Crashes, the opposite countries might be happy to see the declining Chinese economy. A recent economic paper published on Internet, has succeeded in providing convincing evidence to prove that China itself will be beneficial from this event. Why does this result appear? There are several possible reasons for this. To begin with , The Shanghai Composite (SSEC) hit 6200 before the world wide Financial Crisis in 2007. It fell to 3500 in the crisis, then trailed off to 2000 by mid 2014. In February 2015 it was up to 3200, where it started it's bubble climb to Jun 2015's peak around 5200. In late Jul 2015 it's around 3800. So this bubble and crash are not abnormal. The data above showed that even though the Chinese economy was influenced, compare with the whole trend of economy, it is still increasing in general. Additionally, in the long run, China will acquire this experience. And the price of stock may fluctuate in the future so that the high price of stock now may not be continued in the future. To sum up, the author(Hoversten) include his opinion to the Crashes into two sentences: "" The government can't stop a crash. The market will recover. "" 
To my surprise , China become the one who gain benefits from the Crashes rather than other foreign countries. In this way, I want to comprehend more data about the reasons and specific outcomes. The most widely-accepted reason responsible for this case is the change of composite index. To be specific, China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index reduced 8.5%, which result in the 0 increase for this year in general. Many companies, even some large state-owned firms, fell by the maximum daily limit of 10%. The index is now down 38% after the peak in June. (Thompson & Riley, 2015) 
In conclusion, All the evidence supports an unshakable conclusion that China is the one which is beneficial form the Crashes. Even though the result I found was not as same as the answer I used to guess, but it also a reliable reason. Moreover, there were several aspects need to be improved under this circumstance. A case in this point is that government should save the stock less than it did .

Student success is related to communication 
Nowadays, a higher education is becoming more and more important for people which can lead to a better job and a comfortable life. Therefore, people put much emphasize on student success in college. And to those international students who study aboard, there are always a lot of problems they have to deal with. So how do international students to be successful in college? Some people thought communication is the most important thing since students should learn how to get along with other people. While some people considered academic learning as a more important factor. In my opinion, what really matters is communication. Student should talk more and join more activities if they can. 
First of all, communication can help students to solve problems. There are lots of difficulties which is hard to deal with it alone so ask others for help is always a good way. In my interview with <name>, a graduation from Purdue University. He said, ""students need to talk with their professor or advisor before choosing a major or deciding what class to take"", he added, ""whenever students have any problem in their subjects, they can talk with other students or ask professor for help"". So communication can help students with some academic problems. What's more, it also help students with some life problems. For example, students can talk with their room assistant if they have any questions about living in campus. 
The second reason is that communication can practice language skills especially for international students like me. As we all know, international students always have many problems in language. As I found on website, ""academic difficulties1"", language issues apparent immediately as soon as they take class. International students are difficult to understand what professor had said and they are also hard to express what they think. The language problems also affect students' homework since they can't understand the work clearly. To solve such problems, they have to keep talking with native speakers to improve their skills. Therefore, communication is very important in such case. 
The third and the last, communication can help international students to learn about the culture. We may all know ""culture shock"" and this always happens to international students. So they may misunderstand what native do which can't be seen in their homeland and become embarrass. Therefore, we can communicate with others to learn about their cultures which can not only help students to broaden their horizons but also make more friends in college. 
Though communication is so important, there are still some other views about this. Some people think communication is not the only factor that affect students' success. It is true but communication is the most important among those factors. Without communication, the other factors do not work neither. There are also some people said that to learn about foreign culture, it is more helpful to just travel around to experience new things by themselves. I agree with this and hope I can travel too but it is impossible because we are still students and we should to stay in college and keep learning professional knowledge so it is more reliable for students to be familiar with different culture by talking with others. 
In a word, learning to communicate with others and then join some ""right"" activities can help students a lot to be successful in college. By doing these, students can handle with some difficulties with others and then improve their personalities and all of these can benefit them in the future.

"Communication: Best Way to Lessen Roommate Discord 
Never have human beings enjoyed such huge and great connection between each other by the innovation of computers and phones, and, most of all, Internet. Having a wonderful time chatting with friends with a highly advanced tool, people start to forget about their ability to solve conflicts among individuals in a mature way. One projection of this scenario occurs when people have roommates. Most people on this earth have had or still have roommates to live with for various reasons. Along with this popularity, there are problems. In my opinion, communication is the most effective way to solve the problems with roommates for following 3 reasons. 
My first reason is that communication is the primary method by which people obtain and exchange information. In this case, communication is the most important way to let roommates know how the individual thinks and feels. It is know to all, there are many differences between people with various cultural backgrounds. Without communication, people may not even realize that they are offending each other. The example from my friend can illustrate this point in a clearer way. In southern part of China, it is considered disrespectful or even inauspicious to put the your mirror in front of other people. My friend, from southern part of China, met an American roommate, who just put her mirror on the table, which accidently aimed to my friend all the time. Then my friend got really upset but she never brought this issue to the person involved. After my friend followed my suggestion of communicating with her roommates, it turned out that the American had no idea that this caused so much trouble to my friend. Then the mirror was put to another place in the end. To sum up, in order to construct a transparent and healthy relationship with one's roommates, one should always learn to communicate. 
Furthermore, in my own perspective, the absence of communication will eventually result in detrimental outcome, which means if there is an issue, we need to solve it before it goes too far. In April 2013, there was a murder in the Fudan University in China[1]. The crime was committed by a student who was constantly annoyed by his roommates' lifestyle and then a fight between them finally led to the murder. Furthermore, A 19-year-old student was charged with fatally stabbing her roommate, and the reason she committed such a crime was so na ve even ridiculous: she was unhappy about music volume playing from an i Pod of her roommate. 2 These are extreme examples caused by morbid psychology. In daily life, we can see a lot of people choose to move out and change roommates due to some grudge between people. These are all unhealthy way to deal with a roommates' disagreement. Neither should we just run away from it, nor should we take drastic action, what we really need to do is sit down and talk about the problems. 
Finally, there are other benefits when we successfully address a roommates' problem by communication and confrontation. ""As we step in to society, we will run into people who are different than us and have disagreement with us. The skill of solving these problems need to be established and is valued by a lot of company. Plus, during the talking, we can really understand what the real problems are."" Say from my Residence Assistant who I interviewed. Maybe the issues arise due to one person's perfunctory action or maybe it is more than one person's fault. The gist of talking is that, either way, people can learn and perfect themselves after realizing what they did was wrong. What's more, the correction among roommates makes people get progress and then great friendship may begin. 
Nevertheless, some people may argue that why we share a place with somebody while we can live by ourselves? Yes, we can, but at the same time we will lose countless benefit. Living with someone means one will perform better on their working and studying stage[3], for there will always be someone who motivates you and corrects your wrong behavior; living with someone means one can always get help on time; living with roommates means one can expand their social circle. Besides, one can also reduce the rent by living with someone else. Additionally, there are people who, on the contrary, hold the view that it is unnecessary to talk, since some people just cannot be talked sense into. In this case, some mediation may be needed. If you are a resident in a university or a school, Residence Assistant is a great option to ask for. If you rent an apartment, the landlord is a good option, but if the situation gets worse, you may need to call the media or even police. 
""Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing.""[4] Only through communication and confrontation can people truly begin to know each other and then walk in others' shoes. If someone has the chance to live with roommates, I'd say: ""go for it."" If there were conflicts between them, I'd say: ""that's even better."" Because this is the chance of people getting progress and making friendship. To summarize, there is no better way than communication to solve roommates' problems, since communication is the essential way for people to get to know each other; communication can prevent some tragedy happening if it's used on time; communication may start a new friendship. So I suggest here that we all learn to talk to each other more and build a better world.

Stagnation or progress: Dilemma in Korean military system 
	On June 25th, 1950, historically big incident happened by the general named General Kim Il-Sung. North Korea invaded major cities of South Korea to take over the whole control of the whole nation. This war is called the Korean War. At that time, South Korea had to escape down to Busan, which is the very down southern city of South Korea. However, as well known to most of the people, General Douglas Mac Arthur, the hero of both the United States and the South Korea, saved South Korea from the big danger and helped them to recover its nation throughout Seoul, the current capital of the South Korea. 
	The recent policies about the Korean army system now require the soldiers to pay to do their laundries and also increased the price for the cigarettes. These kinds of policies are also pressuring the soldiers and now the issues about the Korean army system are now being spotlighted by the whole world. The whole world is paying attention to the issues in South Korea because the South Korea is the entrance to the Asian culture. The reason why the United States helped South Korea during Korean War is the same reason. If South Korea got fully invaded and became a communist country, the situations for nowadays' global issues about Democratic and Communism would be totally different. 
Not only the world stage but also the feminism perspective is paying attention to these issues. The trend for the females who agree to the decrease of the military service and improving the army circumstances is getting higher. On one side, In Sook Kwon, the author of 'A feminist exploration of military conscription: The gendering of the connections between Nationalism, Militarism and Citizenship in South Korea', tells that the nature of the South Korean military is naturally thought of masculine thing and therefore it has a little thing to do with women. By seeing South Korean army as a male job gives meaning to be a South Korean and this is an implicit truth. Therefore, women have to play the roles other than the opposite gender's role, the manly job. However, this truth has been changing gradually and that the perspective from women's side is gaining more and more power as the time passes. 
	Interestingly, despite of all the claims that we should build our 'own' army, the current Korean military facts show that we are depending too much of our responsibility on the United States. In fact, U.S. is spending more money than the South Korean government in the South Korean army. This must be shocking, since it means that South Korea has a long way to go to be totally independent against North Korea in terms of armed force. Everybody thinks that without United States, South Korea would be easily conquered by North Korea or even by China or Japan except Japan cannot initiate anymore after the World War II. The problem is not merely about the financial terms. United States citizens started to display their worries in country secrets being unwillingly transparent and being showed to the whole world through South Korea. Since South Korea and United States are allies, United States ought to share the certain portion of the army top secrets with South Korea in order to be more intimate and build faith between them. Moreover, South Korean civilians worry about the growing influence of the United States in their everyday. Whenever the United States want to, they would withdraw their forces from South Korea and South Korea would be facing all sorts of threats in face immediately. According to <name>, on the other hand opinion, the only reason that the United States army has been in South Korea is to give South Korean army the full autonomy, and the worries in current stage is very natural. The process for the full independence is still progressing and near future, South Korea would be fully independent. Of course, most of the citizens in both South Korea and United States do not agree with this claim. Even if the cause is to be right, the problems on the surface look too serious to be ignored. The opposing people claim that it is now the time that U.S. army force should leave South Korea to achieve what they have thrived for. This issue should not be any simple, and both nations should be as much considerate as possible. It does not have to be excessive and make U.S. leave instantly, but the direction of the policies should be definitely heading towards it, which is vague in current point. 
	The indicators that South Korea is collapsing in its inner system are getting prominent as the issues come out abruptly and rapidly. According to the recent research, the trend of the total suicidal rate in South Korea is increasing gradually, but steadily. In detail, among the OECD countries, South Korea has the highest suicidal rate among every other country, which is 29. 1 for every hundred thousand people. According to Kirk's claim, in reality, South Korea is being threatened rather by inside their system, neither by North Korea nor United States. Especially in military system, South Korea is pressuring and dragging them to the tragedy. This is a heads-up issue and they should definitely pay special attention and try their best to solve this issue as soon as possible because as this issue stays as a complication to the nation, the more collapsing result it would cause towards the country. There are various factors that pressure the soldiers in army, and some of which are sexual torture, constant bullying, physical torture, comparatively long period of serving which is 21 months, the fact that they have to go back to the normal life and do all the works again to get to the normal life cycle. There are definitely many other factors than these, but these are the most prominent factors. 
	The most realistic evidence that proves the current soldiers in South Korean army is being mistreated is that the little benefits they get despite of their hard works. According to <name>, who used to serve in the United States army and also have been to South Korea, South Korean soldiers get none of the benefits such as the education support or the house funding. Without any further benefits such as things displayed above, there would be absolutely no way to solve the current issues. In fact, most of the South Korean soldiers complain about their current situations and try to avoid the service if possible. There was a big issue by the musician named MC Mong, since he tried to avoid the military service by pulling out his tooth out. In a law according to the military service, it says that if one has less tooth than the minimal, than he is free of the responsibility of the service. After this issue was pulled out, MC Mong was unable to do any of his works such as music and other things for several years because the public would not allow him anymore. Like this, military service is one of the most sensitive issues in South Korea. The problem is that more and more people are trying various methods to get out of the military service responsibility. Not only the benefits are being problem, but the salary itself also a huge issue. According to the research, in average, the soldiers get 150 dollars per month for 21 months. And surprisingly, this amount is 3.8% increased comparing to the previous year. It is such a tragedy that the current soldiers are being treated in such manners. South Korean government should pay attention to this issue as soon as possible and come up with the best suiting political and legal improvement. 
	It is the soldiers who save people from danger when emergency situations happen, or even the war happens. South Korea is now in a forked road and they have to pick one: either stagnation or progress. It is not hundred percent sure that if changing the policies would make every situations better, but it is definitely worth trying because the current policies are such nonsense. Soldiers are doing the hardest jobs, but also being treated the hardest among every other job. Soldier used to be a popular job among the children and most of the high school students during 1980s, but after the nature of the army turned to harsh and demanding background, the popularity decreased greatly. This is also a clear indicator that something wrong happened inside the military that made the people turned their back away from it. Now is definitely the right time to change: Make the soldiers happier, the nation happier.

A New Era: Renewable Eergy 
As fossil fuels near depletion, finding something to replace fossil fuel is important. Alternative energy refers to various sources energy that could replace fossil fuel (i.e. any type of energy that could supplement fossil fuel can be considered alternative energy). There are many forms of alternative energy available, but energy classified as renewable energy is the best option today. Renewable energy does not come from fossil fuel, but comes from naturally occurring sources that are inexhaustible. Some examples of the major sources of renewable energy include hydroelectric, solar, and wind power. Renewable energy has several advantages over fossil fuel, which makes it a better source energy than fossil fuel because of the aspect that it can meet the supply demand, the cheap costs, and the notion that the resource is inexhaustible. 
There are beliefs about renewable energy not being the best replacement for fossil fuel because some people say that renewable energy has limits on its energy production. There are doubts to whether or not the quantity of energy produced is able to keep up with the demand. Today's share of the energy proportion is dominated by fossil fuel. Only a small fraction of energy in the United States is produced by renewable energy, at just 14.3%. (Bossong, 2014) This means that of the total renewable energy only account for 14.3% which are either produced by solar, hydro, or wind. Secondly, renewable energy is more expensive to set up and operate than fossil fuel. For example, the technology required to trap solar energy is expensive, and the amount of capital needed to set up the dams are too costly. Thirdly, although the resource might be inexhaustible, locating the right environment that has the capability to accommodate renewable energy is too challenging. Finding an environment that is suitable for renewable energy is difficult, as it needs to have continuous sunlight, water and wind to produce the energy that is required. These factors make renewable energy too dependent on climate. In the following paragraphs, I will rebut these claims by providing evidence that renewable energy is a better source of energy than fossil fuel. 
By the current standards, it is acknowledgeable that renewable energy comparative to fossil fuel produces significantly less amount of energy. However, there are exceptions to this thought. There are already parts of the world where renewable energy shows promise for the future. For example, Germany already gets 25% of its energy from renewable sources, with a goal of increasing that portion to 80% by 2050 (Lohan, 2012). Other countries, such as Portugal witnessed a large share of their energy produced by renewable energy. Wind power became Spain's top source of energy, while in Portugal it produced over 70% of its energy in the first quarter of 2013. (Koronowski, 2013) In other parts of the world, China's wind electricity ousted energy production by coal. In Denmark's case, it has a set specific phases of goals. By 2035, it aims to produce heat and power by renewable energy, and by 2050 converting all energy to renewable energy. (Gillism2014) These are some examples of countries that show renewable energy already meeting the demand. In these society, renewable energy became a more focal part of energy production than fossil fuel. These are evidence of the fact that renewable energy can meet the energy demand. On the following paragraph, I will explain how renewable energy has become cost competitive with fossil fuel. 
The claim that renewable energy is more expensive than fossil fuel is an old statement. Energy from renewable sources has many merits that make it more cost efficient overall. First, there are no prices for renewable sources. There are input costs for fossil fuel such as coal and the purchase of coal is necessary for power plants to create energy which increases the operating cost. On the other hand, renewable resources such as wind, hydro, and solar are free which means that cost of operation is going to be extensively cheaper than fossil fuel. In other words, once the wind turbines and solar panels are set up, the cost of buying resources is not needed, and free. Secondly, it shows that the even operating expenses of renewable energy are becoming cost competitive with fossil fuel. (Parkinson 2014)The cost of solar and wind continue to decline and increasing becoming economically competitive with fossil fuel such as natural gas or coal. In the case of solar, setting up solar panels is cheaper for homes and business than the common retail rates for electricity. (Parkinson, 2014) As time goes on, renewable energy will become more practical as renewable energy are becoming increasingly cost competitive with fossil fuel. The next paragraph will deal with issue with the effect of environment has on renewable energy. 
Renewable energy is not heavily affected by varying environment. First, there are lots of geographical areas around the world that have more than sufficient resources. These geographical areas are not focused in one region, but spread out around the world that help make renewable energy more reliable. This means that any country can reach high shares of wind and solar energy. There is wind everywhere, just as there is always going to be sunlight. The changing weather will only affect small amount of the areas with resources, not the whole renewable energy. Therefore, abrupt changes in weather distribution will effect only that specific area of resource but not cut off the entire region. According to an article by the Guardian, any country has the capability to make renewable energy a mainstream source of energy. (Harvey, 2011) Another evidence of weather being a minimal problem renewable energy is that technological efficiency have the potential to make up for the instability of climate. Secondly, renewable energy unlike fossil fuel is not subject to depletion, but available all around the world. As time goes, renewable energy will become easier to find as wind and solar is inexhaustible, whereas fossil fuel, which will deplete. It will become more challenging to extract fossil fuel, while a location with an adequate environment with renewable sources, will be useable for a longer period of time. The statistics show that renewable is available for all the countries. Environment doesn't not influence renewable resources to the point that renewable energy is not viable. Due to the vast area that have renewable sources, a single environment will not affect renewable energy. 
	Replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy is viable for the reasons that it is capable pf producing energy to the amount that fossil fuel does, relatively cheap cost, and the notion that the resource is inexhaustible. Statistics show that in some countries like Germany and Denmark, the proportion of which energy is being produced by renewable energy is increasing. Also, research shows that solar panels are becoming convenient with daily use, and becoming cheaper than retail electricity. Lastly, as wind, solar and water exist all over the world, issues such as weather or climate will not pose a danger. The resources such as wind and solar does not go away, and are inexhaustible which make renewable energy a worth investment for the long term, and a more reliable resource. In my opinion, renewable energy has the potential to be an adequate replacement for fossil fuel. It is a certain fact that fossil fuel will deplete, and at this time renewable energy seems to be the best choice. To improve the current situation of renewable energy, basic knowledge about renewable energy must be made available to the public. By gaining insight on renewable energy, people become open towards renewable energy, and thus feel the need of renewable energy in our society.

Is it healthier to skip a meal or eat junk food? 
Over the course of this research question I was able to gather enough research and data to come up with an argumentative question to discuss. That is, that you must not skip a meal, even if it means you have to eat junk food. The reason I chose this motion is because with the evidence I have collected and discussed in the previous papers tend to support the idea that not eating at all can have a worse impact on the body and how it causes us to react than eating unhealthy for one meal. 
This topic is important as it relates to adolescents specifically around the world and more importantly, it relates to me and gives me a better insight to eating healthier for my benefit. I chose this topic because as I have progressed throughout my freshman year, I have begun to eat less or eat unhealthier which has caused drastic changes in my health and in the way I behave and react. Previously I used to be alert and assertive at all times as I had a stable healthy meal with all my necessary nutrients, whereas as the year has gone by I have begun to eat less and at unsuitable times which has affected me negatively. As I started researching this topic I was able to find many scientific articles and other published material on how, not eating a proper meal can affect our body. The motion I would like to support in my paper using scientific research and an interview is that it is better to eat unhealthy food, rather than skip a meal.

The difference between human beings and social animals in social psychological field 
Background 
	How do human beings differentiate from other animals? There are many answers for this question from different academic perspectives. However, in social psychological field, we use the term cultural animals to differentiate human beings from the rest of other animals. According to Baumeister and Bushman (2016), there are three distinguishable traits human beings have: shared belief, social norms and senses of self. 
Block 1 
Shared Belief 
	First of all, Baumeister and Bushman (2016) defined shared belief as one of the unique characteristic cultural animals have. By shared belief, they mean the common things a group of people have, which can be based on everything, such as gender, race and nationality. For example, people who share the same nationality always speak the same language. Females and males have different character and hobbies. People from difference race have different life style. As you may notice now, the belief Baumeister and Bushman are talking about is not common understanding of belief. The belief in social psychological field has wider range of definition: not only faith, but also custom. In contrast, the difference between social animals just exists because of biology, genes and evolution. Nature selects the trait that best helps a spiece survive and have offspring, which is completely different compared to human beings. 
Social Norms 
	Secondly, social norms are also used to differentiate human beings from social animals. Baumeister and Bushman stated, this descriptive social norm is what guides people's behavior. It exists in daily life in form of rules, laws, or even authority request. People need to follow these norms in order to get social acceptance. Otherwise, they may be excluded or isolated. Sometimes the situation may be even worse when people violate laws: they will be put in jails to stay away from others. To avoid these kinds of punishment, depriving opportunity to get in touch with other human beings, people will normally follow the social norms.

Car Energy Technology 
	The most common method of transportation in the world is the gas powered car. Nowadays, however, some people want the gas engine out of their daily lives. I think that moving away from the gas engine to the current alternatives with the current technology will cause nothing but more damage to the environment. 
	For starters, current gas engines can be modified to use biofuels, a renewable source, so they can run with nearly the same efficiency as regular gas engines. One of the main current alternatives is the electric car which uses batteries to store the energy in them. The electric car is not nearly as efficient as the gas engine, because it needs to be charged for a day in order to go 230 miles unlike the gas car which can be simply refueled in minutes. Also as the car increases in size and weight the efficiency of the electric engine drops exponentially, making semis almost impossible to power by batteries only. ( <name> , personal communication, 2015) 
	In addition, battery production produces a lot of harmful byproducts to the environment. With the current battery technology, each battery will have a life expectancy of five years and if the world relies on them primarily the current damage to the environment will be amplified, leading to more toxics being added to an already polluted environment. According to Troy Hawkins, ""[batteries] will cause the same amount of damage to the environment as gas engines.""(2013) Also, lithium batteries may cause some health concerns. The EPA even linked the lithium batteries with ""everything from cancer to neurological problems"" (Braun, 2013) making the production of lithium batteries very harmful. Moreover, having a lithium battery will cause a lot of safety issues because if the lithium is exposed to the water vapor in the air it will catch fire and may cause an explosion. 
	Another alternative to the gas engine is the hybrid car. The hybrid car uses a mixture of batteries and gas to power the engine. The claim is they get better ""mileage"", which is how many miles are covered with one gallon of gas. But according to <name> , ""hybrids do not get better mileage than normal gas cars."" Even though the EPA claims number of miles per gallon, usually when professionals who test cars get lower mileage. In addition, the consumption is even more in real life and the mileage is lower. Making the hybrid car very ineffective in reducing the gas consumption or pollution. Moreover, hybrids have batteries in them, which share the same weaknesses as batteries in electric cars but the weaknesses in hybrids are more apparent. Because of how hybrids are structured they cannot get a lot of power to the wheels efficiently as the car switches back and forth between two sources. Another problem is the batteries now have gas near them so if they do get exposed to the air they will catch fire and cause a doubling effect with the fuel in the tank. 
	One of the arguments people may have against staying with gas engines is that cars produce a lot of carbon dioxide which harms the environment in the long run, as it contributes to global warming and severe weather conditions. It may be true that the effect of carbon dioxide in the long run is harmful to the earth, but the battery production may cause more damage to us in the shorter term which I think is much more important. The question is will your grandchildren live in a terrible future or will your grandchildren be able to live at all? 
	A second argument is that gas prices are always rising. This is true gas prices are always rising, but also batteries will cost less and less in the short term then the prices will start rising, as a matter of fact, everything costs more overtime, it is one of the major side effects of inflation. (""Historical Inflation Rate"", 2015) Because of how the world economic growth is based on inflation, it will not go away anytime soon. 
	Another argument is that gas companies hold a monopoly over the gas supply and as the gas reserve ends this will cause a huge price jump leading to people unable to afford to run their cars. This argument is true, but lithium is the main component of most batteries is also a natural resource that can be monopolized and have the same consequences as gasoline. 
	In conclusion, I think the gas engine is irreplaceable in the near future, because the alternatives mainly use batteries as a main source of power which hold many environmental concerns and health issues that may not make us see our future entirely. However, as more research is done and more technologies evolve, the gas engine will be replaced to a more environmentally friendly alternative.

Digital Technology has Positive Influence on Students' Study 
Digital technology, also known as information and communication technology (ICT), constantly gives rise to people's attention when it comes to its non-negligible influence on students' study. With smartphones, tablets and personal computers exploding on the market, the young generation are inevitably influenced by those digital products, so is their study. According to Chen et al. (2015), 86 percent of undergraduates own a smartphone, and nearly half (47 percent) own a tablet. The high ownership indicates widespread use of digital products for study. Internet serves as a great platform where information communicates and integrates and students can have access to it with the help of their digital gadgets. Expanding access to education information, providing flexible study schedule and increasing teaching diversity in class, digital technology stands out in reforming the traditional learning and teaching mode and it brings wonderful benefits to students' life. 
Digital technology provides more convenient access to information which is of much help to students' study. Professor <Name> is a professor in Materials Engineering at Purdue University and every other day he will upload some lecture videos to the Internet to help students review and digest the learning materials. He embraces digital technology with great enthusiasm and encourages his students to use their laptops or tablets to watch the videos or search for study resources. And his students like those lecture videos because if they can't attend a class they can watch the video to catch up with other students. Digital technology in fact increases the communication between Professor <Name> and his students. His students can learn more than what they are taught in class and professor can get feedback from the comments under the videos. It is believed that both the teacher and students gather more useful information which facilitate teaching and studying. According to Wardlow (2014), technology brings tutors and mentors all over the world to students. Studying from teachers all around world and acquire more study resources will definitely broaden students' horizon and enable them to learn more thoroughly. (E. Slamovich, personal communication, February 24, 2016). 
Digital technology liberates students from traditional study mode and provide more flexible schedule. Mbah (2010) reported that ""ICT is considered to exploit the flexibility of training. The rhythm of study, the allocation of time and the availability of teachers can allow better articulation between private life (studies) as well as a better allocation of time between the various uses."" Digital technology provides more access to study resources thus enabling students to learn without the limitation of time and places. If you want to learn a new language, there is always an App in the Appstore which can help you to learn new words and sentences. If you want to study a new software, there are always online videos which teach people how to use it step by step. Study becomes so convenient and accessible that students can adjust their schedule effortlessly to balance their private life and study. <Name>, a student in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue, said that he felt his study efficiency had improved because he could learn according to his own schedule with the help of his ipad or smartphone, reducing the possibility of wasting time. Never can study mode be so ""mobile"" and students can enjoy the freedom of allocating their time on their own now. (<Name>, personal communication, February 22, 2016). 
Technology and digital media are helping educators do their jobs better and students can benefit from the diversity of teaching method. According to Dwyer (2011), ""more teachers than ever are incorporating interactive games, activities, lesson plans, and simulations into the classroom. Sixty-two percent of teachers say they use digital media twice a week or more and 24 percent say they use it every day to help them teach. The numbers of teachers using TV and video content in the classroom is even higher. Over 80 percent of teachers say they use TV or video to teach a lesson at least once a month and 76 percent are streaming it from the web."" There is no doubt that the widespread use of technology media in class will attract students and motivate them to learn if they feel study can be more interesting with the presence of digital products. After all, ""Integrating technology in education everyday helps students stay engaged. Today's students love technology so they are sure to be interested in learning if they can use the tools they love,"" Wainwright (n.d.) asserted. 
However, digital technology has some disadvantages as well, which have attracted our teachers' attention. Richtel (2012) argued that a majority of teachers hold the belief that digital technology can impair their study abilities such as attention spans if they indulge in digital technology, and students are more likely to give up once they encounter challenging problems for which they can't find easy solutions on the Internet. But in fact not all students are addicted to Internet and digital products. Take myself for example, when I was first introduced to the smartphone, those convenient functions appealed to me so much that I couldn't help exploring the new functions of my smartphone day and night. But with time going by, I was attuned to the presence of my phone and I wouldn't be distracted by it anymore. What's more, if students can find their own way to utilize digital products for study, they won't be devastated by them. I can now use smartphone to memorize new words in the early morning read e-books before class, and do homework online with my laptop at night. After all of the work, I will reward myself with watching a video online to fresh my mind. I feel I am at a good balance between study and recreation and can use digital products rationally. As a result, my study efficiency gets improved and my life is much more enjoyable than before. 
After all of the discussion above, we can come to the conclusion that digital products affect students' study positively in terms of offering students more accessible resources for study, helping students allocating time flexibly and making class time more interesting. If digital technology is utilized properly, students will benefit from it greatly without being distracted by it. And it can be foreseen that study will become more and more rely on digital technology in the future and students' study efficiency will get improved consistently.

Calling Family Cannot Cope With Homesickness 
International students meet multiple challenges when they study abroad, such as foreign language, homesickness and illness. Compared with other challenges, homesickness is one of the main topics that psychologists focus on. According to its causes, such as people lack of spiritual support, homesickness researchers list multiple strategies to cope with international students' homesickness. Among these various methods, I argue that international students should reduce the times of calling family in order to effectively deal with negative feelings of homesickness. 
	International students should call home less often because communicating with family frequently can stimulate and amplify students' homesickness. Compared with writing, talking is more likely to remind students of home background. When a student hears parents saying they miss him/her, he/she may generate similar feeling. CNN reporter Derrick Ho (2010) pointed out that ""phone calls can backfire."" In Ho's article, psychologist Chris Thurber (2010) emphasized that when parents notice children crying or children hear parents crying, homesickness will be exacerbated (Ho, 2010). Furthermore, when students call parents, students not only hear their parents' voice, but also the sounds near parents, which can also impact students' feelings. For example, I am an international student from China. When I called my family during the Spring Festival in China, I could clearly hear the loud sounds of firecrackers. Loneliness generated in my mind immediately, and it seemed that my family forgot me. 
	Talking with family lets students not only feel isolated from family, but also feel isolated from new society. Thus, the second reason is that calling family frequently cannot develop international students' ability of enlarging new social network. Main homesickness reasons are international students are unable to adjust to novel place and they lack of mental support. Having several friends from different countries is favorable for students to get out of homesickness troubles. However, spending too much time with family is disadvantageous for students to find friends, for students will have less time to take activities outside. Watt and Badger (2010) wrote that the stronger a person feels homesickness, the more the person communicates with family (16.4%). The relationship between homesickness and phone calls home is positive which shows that the act of phone calls can aggravate homesickness (P. 335-350). For instance, my first month after coming to America, I spent whole night talking with my mother through Internet. At first, I felt pretty well, for I was accompanied with my mom; however, I gradually found out my classmates were aggregated together and had dinners many times. I deeply thought I was isolated, for I had no friends. It was true that this increases my homesickness. In contrast, in this year, I altered my schedule of talking with parents. At beginning of the action, it was hard to me, but I quickly adjusted university life: I took more club activities where I met like-minded people. 
	Additionally, the cultural differences, which largely are reflected in language, can cause international students' homesickness. Calling family frequently reduces international students' chances of learning English, for they stay in a native language environment. As we all know, if international students master English, they will have motivation and confidence in studying and chatting with foreign students. Therefore, their homesickness will be coped with. For example, I have a friend, who calls her family every two weeks. She told me that without communicating with her parents, she had more time to listen to presentation, such as TED, which greatly improved her English speaking. 
	My opponents state that students should communicate with family frequently, for it creates a homelike atmosphere. I agree that while speaking with family, students feel that parents are standing next to them. However, there are various methods to create a homelike atmosphere. For example, texting and sending email to family can also achieve the same effect. By texting, parents and children are more likely to express feelings because sometimes people are shy to say something. In addition, when using texting, phones save the messages, so when students miss home, they can review the message as soon as possible. As for sending email, it can not only save the messages as well, but also reduce the overall cost of communication. 
	In conclusion, I believe that calling family frequently blocks the pathway of dealing with homesickness by increasing students' homesickness, and by decreasing opportunities to make friends and learn English. If students decrease the number of times they call their family, they will have more friends and be independent. With the help of texting and sending email, students can create a homelike atmosphere without calling home as frequently. Eventually, students will not be interrupted by homesickness and then pay more attention to studying.

"How do Chinese students get involved in American social life? 
As the number of international students in America increases, the problems of international students, like adaptation, become more and more important for universities. In this essay, I will take Chinese students in America as an example, because Chinese students are the main part of all international students. Instead of talking about all aspects of their college life, I will focus on their social life on campus in this paper. In term of the poor situations that Chinese students have, especially difficulties in getting involved in college life, people have different ideas about it, and I classify those ideas into to two categories. Some of them think highly of students themselves in looking for solutions, and they think the key is that students have to change themselves to fit in new circumstances. On the contrary, others focus on changing the environment, like setting up special sessions for international student, to help Chinese students get involved in the new life. If I have to choose one, I support the second idea. In order to make my opinion clear, I will describe each thought in specific examples in the following paragraphs. 
For those who think students should change themselves to the greatest extent to fit in college social life, they are more likely to leave Chinese students alone and suppose they can adapt into American life gradually. It reminds me of one sentence that no one can change you but yourself. Wenli Yuan, who comes from Kean University, talked about attitudes toward adaptation after interviewing ten Chinese students studying in America. He stated that some of Chinese students may be unwilling to change themselves in order to fit in new life; however, for those who want to get involved in American style, they will find their own ways to achieve the goal, like joining in clubs, hanging out with American friends, and attending American parties. In this case, personal beliefs are the major factor influencing students' behaviors. Also this kind of self-concept is one of most important reasons that affects international students when they try to get themselves understood. Like Christopher Deal wrote in his essay in which he tried to find perfect solutions for Asia students studying in America, Asia students should examine themselves by identifying who they really are and be prepared for incoming challenges. Because when Chinese students come to America, they are putting themselves in a totally different world, and the only way to adapt into a environment where they are the different ones is to change themselves instead of hoping others to change for them. 
When international students are not occupying a big part of college students in America, the self-motivation idea may work, but when international students become more and more, the inconvenience of international students will affect other students in the college. For example, in an activity, there are 5 international students and 5 American students, and now they want to do a game that Americans are familiar with. In this situation, American students have to explain the game rules to other international students, or the game cannot be continued smoothly. As a result, when the number of international students become more, universities have to take some strategies to make international students, especially Chinese students, feel comfortable in unfamiliar environments. 
The topic is about how to adapt into social life in America, so when Chinese students meet problems in their social life, Seeking help is one way for international students to get connected with social life in colleges. If universities do not set up organizations to meet problems of a big amount of international students, they will finally get in trouble because the inconvenience of international students eventually will affect other students in both academic life and social life. In the academic essay which writes about supporting international students' transition to the United States, authors wrote a lot about mental services in college which help international students release their burden when feel stressed in new circumstances. The essay also says that establishing a supportive network in the U.S. is very critical in the successful adjustment of international students. 
Professional organizations which focus on helping international students not only help students solve initially adaptive problems but also some mental or academic problems they may have after they get involved. For example, instead of asking for help in social life, Chinese students may seek suggestions when they have poor performance on assignments, and they may need mental health services when they have problems with their friends. If there is no professional organizations to help them, some of international students may end up in poor scores and finally lose confidence. Even though there maybe a small amount of international students who are afraid of expressing themselves, it would be better if universities set up some institutions to help them overcome their difficulties, because it will finally not only help international students, but also provide American students a precious platform to know more about people from all over the world and cultivate their ability to help others. 
In addition to mental health center, open activities also can help Chinese students adjust to American social life. For example, University of California, Los Angel, offers the Welcome Dance, international movie clubs, and conversational group meetings in order to help international students. Much more connections with people around provide Chinese students a precious place to release their stress and adjust to new life better. 
According to two ideas and specific explanation I gave above, the first solution which tell Chinese students to change themselves to fit the changing environment only works when there is a little amount of Chinese students. However, the fact is that Chinese students become more and more in American universities, so the main solution to help them quickly get involved in the new social life is to set organizations which focus on do favors for Chinese students when they meet troubles. Because it not only help Chinese students in colleges now, but also make it better for Chinese students and other international students in the future.

Soccer culture dominates the progress of soccer 
As soccer has dramatically growing influences in people's life, a reflection that why the competitiveness among clubs or countries differs obviously is generated. Sometimes, sorrow because of favorite team's defeat will impact a soccer fan's emotion for several days, while excitement come from the victory will motivate someone's everyday in the next month. Based on the interview with <name> and article materials published, I strongly reckon that how well a team plays is almost attributed to the soccer culture. 
Furthermore, in the article"" What Soccer means to the world"", the author Tony Karon mentioned another form of soccer culture: globalization. Due to the globalization, very face of nationhood is changing over the world. It is easily seen that athletes in those most impactive football club, Manchester United and Real Madrid, respectively have their race's skin color. This phenomenon positively reflects that soccer has already contained variety in the earth. The connotation of soccer is much more profound than differences or conflicts among races. As the stream of each race gathers into the ocean of soccer, a great soccer culture forms. Communication of worldwide soccer presents and begin to develop towards higher level. Realizing the benefits of that, president of Real Madrid, Florentino, consistently imports the best player from every corner of the world. And this is probably the reason why Madrid FC has been considered as one of the grandest club throughout the history. A glance at the list of player of Madrid FC, James Roderigez from Columbia, Luka Modric from Kroatia, Christiano Ronaldo from Portugal, etc. It is exactly the graceful cooperation created by these genius that brings their club one more championship of champions league. This kind of soccer culture is generally recognized by people and actually is the most essential element that prompt the modern soccer. 
Admittedly, some critics would say that fundings and government's support play more important roles in the grade of a soccer team. I don't deny the existence of their influences, but as a matter of fact, fundings or government's support can be affected by great soccer culture, which can be proved by fandoms' actions. For instance, when Wenger, the manager of Arsenal, did not bought any players to enhance strength of his team, Arsenal fans organized several parades to protest Wenger's negative act even though Arsenal possesses the most sufficient cash storage in Europe. Impacted by fans' behaviors, Wenger bought the most valuable Mid field player, Mezut Ozil, and since then, by the organization of Ozil, Arsenal gradually became unstoppable in the league. This is exactly how fandoms' enthusiasm and responsibility make the club change, and increase intrusion of funding into construction of club. And if see this condition in big picture, that soccer culture is more powerful than fundings and authority proves my disagreement with those critics. Protest called by people in China also forces government to replace the president of relative apartment. This is another evidence that government's support is less essential than soccer culture, the loyalty and sincerity to the soccer. 
Conclusively, if anybody asks what makes a team so successful, I would always respond soccer culture as answer. Soccer culture is like a mentality of human, an intention to make soccer more perfect, and a spontaneous as well as subjective instinct. Therefore, any problems hamper the progress of soccer can be overpowered, eliminated by soccer culture. Somebody may doubt that no one can define the concept of soccer culture. Of course, I may not , either. But the only thing I know is that humanity is able to dominate the fate of a team, and the same time, soccer culture forms, together with ""you will never alone"" sung by fandoms of Liverpool standing in the Anfield Stadium.

Why Nuclear Battery Will Change the World 
	Over the past decades, human technology has been growing exponentially in nearly every aspect. Among all kinds of technologies, one of them seems to have fallen behind. People need to recharge their cellphones 3 or 4 times more frequently today than in 2006. This is because the speed at which battery is developing cannot catch up the demand. 
How does this mean that a new battery technology could change the world? This can be explained with an economical term called 'bucket effect'. The overall performance of an integrated product is limited by its weakest part. To make it more clear, let us look at some examples. People can build very fast CPUs today, but those CPUs can hardly be applied to smartphones or laptops. An important reason is that a faster CPU also consumes more power, thus shortens the standby time. Therefore, smartphones and laptops are limited by battery. Moreover, although TESLA 3 performs just like a patrol vehicle, its short cruise mileage and long recharging time keeps thousands of customs away. Electric cars are limited by battery. If you have experienced HTC VIVE just like me, you'll be astonished at how mature the VR technology has been. However, to play VR game we have to be dragging the DC cable all the time, without which the system could not sustain long. That is because people are unable to make a VR battery that is light enough to be put on the head. VR is also limited by battery. That is not all, drones, smart glasses and robots, virtually everything is deeply limited by battery. Noticed or not, our life is literally limited by battery. That's why a revolutionary battery technology can definitely change the world. 
In search of a revolutionary battery, we have basically no choice but nuclear battery. That is because so far nuclear fuels are known as the most energy-concentrated materials in the universe. To be intuitive, one gram of Thorium yields energy of 7500 gallons of gasoline (""Truth Theory"", 2014), allowing a car to travel for about 10 years, or an i Phone 6 to run for 100,000 years, which is much longer than human history. Other types of battery just CANNOT contain more energy than a nuclear battery does, in physical meaning. It's true that among all types of batteries graphene battery is catching more attentions currently, but nuclear battery will be more competitive in the long run. That is because that the advantages of graphene battery are cheap and fast-recharge, while it still needs to be recharged regularly, although fast. Sometimes even a one-minute recharge brings trouble, for example when applied to air/space transportations. 
Some people may question whether the idea of nuclear battery is possible, as until now we have not yet found a successful mechanism to achieve it. They forget the fact that our technology is developing so fast, and we have not yet found one does not mean we cannot find one given 30 years. On the other hand, lots of successful experiments have been conducted in this field recently, and our nuclear battery has been much more sophisticated, powerful and efficiency than 50 years ago (""A review of nuclear batteries"", 2014). Researchers have solved many problems that were once considered extremely hard to solve, such as utilizing beta emission of an isotope without damaging the electrode material (""Plasmon-assisted radio lytic energy conversion in aqueous solutions"", 2014). Thanks to those researches, people are having deeper understanding of battery science. There is a benign cycle between experiment and theory. I believe people are able to overcome all those technical challenges since nuclear battery is theoretically possible. 
When talking about nuclear under any circumstance, safety is always a major concern. Many people regard nuclear energy as a double-edged sword, it brings power but at the same time also brings harmful radiation and horrible leak accidents. The fact, however, is right the opposite. The catastrophic consequences of leak accidents fool the public as if nuclear energy is always that terrible. Just like people are usually more anxious when taking an airplane than travelling on a highway despite that they are statistically more possible to die under the latter situation, it is human nature to value the consequence more important than the probability of consequence. Actually, even when taking all the most terrible leak accidents in to account, nuclear energy is so far the safest energy in the world (deaths/MW*h). It is safer than solar energy and even wind energy. It is basically a single-edged sword. The leak accidents have once forced several governments to put limit on nuclear energy, but most of them have been aware of the actual safeness of nuclear energy recently, and are re-enabling it (""Nuclear energy policy by country"", 2014-2016). 
In conclusion, nuclear battery is possible and essential to us. It is not as dangerous as someone believes, on the contrary it is safer than any other resource. Problems do exist, but they are to be solved rather than to be afraid of. With the help of nuclear battery, a large number of technologies that was once limited by battery capacity can be made possible. That is why it will change the world.

"P5D3 Argumentative Essay 
April 27, 2015 
Pilots should manipulate the airplane to improve the safety of airplanes 
Nowadays, the number of people who would like to choose airplane as their transportation for business or traveling is increasing. Taking airplanes has become a part of our daily life. Meanwhile, with the air crashes happened among these months, people started to concern about the safety of the airplane. To figure out how to make the plane safer, one important way is to let pilots manipulate the airplane instead of handing all the tasks to the computers. 
The computers are becoming more powerful with the development of technology, and the programmers even designed the programs that can replace the pilots to control the airplane. At the beginning of the invention of airplane, the pilots had to do so many tasks to take off the airplane and control it while it's in the sky. Then, people had computers to assist them to make the flight easier for the pilots. However, it is not a good idea when people decide to use unmanned aircraft now. Computers are able to be helpful for pilots to fly the planes, but pilots cannot be replaceable. About this argument, I conducted an interview with Professor <name> few weeks ago, and he noted that when the pilots rely too much on the computers, they will lose their flying skills, which will contribute to the disability of handling emergencies. Moreover, Reuters also claimed that, ""When the computers are unable to perform their tasks, control is automatically handed to the pilots who must fall back on training and fly manually, in so-called ""alternate"" mode"", so it is crucial for the pilots to maintain their flying skills to prepare for the any possible situations. 
One more reason why that the pilots should not be replaced is that the computers cannot take the responsibility of hundreds of people's lives. I do not think there are many people who would like to give their lives to the machine. For some emergencies, for example, if the airplane gets hacked, and the person who hacks the airplane wants to go to another place for his/her purposes, but the computers can only follow the previous settings. Will the plane hacker do some crazy things that threat the life of the passengers on board? No one knows, so the airlines cannot just hand hundreds of lives to the computers, because the computers will not consider people's lives and the only the thing they will do is following the code and then finish the flight. 
However, someone might say that computers should replace the pilots, because computers are more accurate than people, and the tasks like flying a plane require that kind of accuracy. While I disagree with that opinion. First, the computers are man-made and they are not perfect and sometimes they still fail, like anyone's PC. Once the computers crash, if there is no pilot on the plane, the chance of saving the people on board is nearly zero. In addition, what's more, it is possible that we can train the pilots more strictly to make them to be as accurate as computers. When the pilots can be accurate like computers, the computers are only the tools to assist the pilots instead of the dominators of the plane. Consequently, the pilotless aircraft is surely not safe, and the computer is not always better than human, because humans are able to act differently depending on different situations. 
In summary, the pilots should manipulate the airplane for the most of time, and they can use computer to assist them to analyze the statue of the airplane. Computers can do other jobs that people cannot do, for example, supervise all the equipment. The computers can also detect every part of the aircraft to make sure that the airplane works perfectly. If there is anything wrong with the engines or any main part of the airplane, the computers will know it and send warnings to the pilots, and let the pilots decide the next step. However, computer can never replace the pilots. There are still some exceptions, like aircrafts for delivery, but for commercial airplanes, it is irresponsible to let computer control the airplane, because pilots still need to maintain their flying skills to face different emergencies that the computers cannot deal with, and passengers need to be taken care of by human instead of computers. 
The safety of the airplane is significant, because it is related to almost everyone, and there are many ways that can make the airplane safer. One way that is pretty useful and important is to improve the quality of the pilots by training them more strictly to get the computers' accuracy and maintain the ability to face different emergencies simultaneously. Maybe one day when computers are able to judge various situations like human, it is possible for them to replace the pilots. But for now, replacing the pilots by computer is definitely detrimental for the safety of the commercial airplane.

PILOTS SHOULD MANIPULATE THE AIRPLANE

"With the rapid development of the automobile industry, the number of automobiles keeps increasing rapidly. People buy them for convenience. Contrary to their intentions, a large proportion of drivers find it is also an inconvenience to owe cars. For instances, drivers may be annoyed at parking problems because the parking space is relatively scarce compared to the amount of cars that need to use them. In addition, the traffic jams are also boring for drivers because they waste a large amount of time and money. The increasing number of automobiles is concurrent with increasing traffic accidents and environmental problems. Because the problems caused by increasing automobiles become more and more serious, the development of public transportation is of great significance.
As a Germany marketing research institute R.L.POLK MARKETING SYSTEMS (2008) clamied in its research, the number of automobiles is expected to rise sharply by 20% between 2008 and 2015, to reach a total of 1. 12 billion. At the same time, the increasing number of automobiles also causes worsening traffic conditions and an increase in traffic accidents. In addition, the automotive emissions will be on the rise, resulting in a worsening air conditions and increase the health risks.
The traffic jams are one of the most serious traffic problems humans are facing. Every year, traffic congestion wastes human considerable money and time. Study shows that"" in 2007, congestion caused urban Americans to travel 4. 2 billion hours more and to purchase an extra 2. 8 billion gallons of fuel for a congestion cost of $87. 2 billion - an increase of more than 50% over the previous decade"". (Schrank & Lomax, 2009) Traffic congestion does not only cause a huge loss in the United States, but virtually all cities in different countries face the loss to different degree. In China, Beijing faces a 40 million yuan loss every day and Guangzhou people cost 11. 7 billion yuan and 1500 million hours annually due to traffic jams. (Daily Economic, 2005) In Toronto, traffic congestion costs $3. 3 billion annually. (BBC, 2009) The exhibit 1 shows the congestion growth trend from 1982 and 2007. The traffic congestion had become increasingly serious between 1982 and 2007, while the number of automobiles is increasing sharply. The increasing number of automobiles will worsen the traffic conditions and cause a more congested transportation. As a result, the economic loss and the wasted time caused by traffic congestion will be expanded.
Exhibit 1 Congestion Growth Trend (Shark and Lomax, 2009)
Another increasingly serious problem are traffic accidents. ""Worldwide, an estimated 1. 2 million people are killed in road crashes each year and as many as 50 million are injured. Projections indicate that these figures will increase by about 65% over the next 20 years unless there is new commitment to prevention"". (WHO, 2004) The traffic accidents tend to be more frequent with the increase of automobiles.
In addition to the traffic problems, the increasing automobiles also worsen the f energy crisis and problems of environmental degradation. In the ""2007 World Energy Outlook"" by the International Energy Agency (IEA), experts forecasted that the consumption of energy will increase sharply in next twenty years and humans may face the threat of an oil crisis, in which the consumption of gasoline plays an important role. In addition to putting a pressure on this energy crisis, the increase of automobiles also aggravates the environmental degradation; automotive emissions can cause a series of air problems, such as photochemical smog, an expanded ozone hole and global warming.
The IEA (2007) indicates that world's primary needs for energy will grow by 55% between 2005 and 2030. Currently, fossil fuels, renewable energies, are the main energy for humans. While the demand for energy for energy is increasing sharply, the current energy reserves are reduced in a quickening rate. As a result, the exploitation of fossil fuels cannot keep pace with the rising consumption, causing a much higher price. With time, fossil fuels will be worn out and the energy shortage is unavoidable if there is no prevention. A main consumption of fossil fuel is the gasoline, which is mostly used for automobile. While the number of automobiles is increasing, the consumption of gasoline tends to rise, which can step up the energy shortage.
In addition to speed up the energy shortage, the increasing number of automobiles also aggravates the exhaust of emissions. As indicated by the IEA (2007), the emissions will jump by 55% between 2005 and 2030. The increase of emissions tends to aggravate the current atmosphere conditions immensely, because a considerable amount of carbon dioxide and various waste gases are exhausted with emissions, which are the major cause of global warming and air pollution. As Gu points out in his article, the automotive pollution occupies 60% to 70% of the air pollution. (2001)The increase of automobiles tends to aggravate the air pollution due to the increasing exhaust.
More health risks and diseases will occur as a result of worsening air pollution. As Klepal concludes from 27 studies which focus on the connection between automotive emissions and health, ""pollution from automobile tailpipes increases the risk of asthma, lung cancer, leukemia and other ailments"". (2004)What is more serious is that the air pollution can also cause a widespread outbreak of diseases and abnormal mass mortality. For instance, the ""Photochemical Smog Event"" in Los Angel in 1940s caused more than 400 deaths and 75% of the citizens had eye syndrome. The considerable amount of automotive emission was one of the main culprits. In 1952, London smog episode caused more than 4000 abnormal deaths and much higher incident of pneumonia, lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. While the automotive emissions raise, the air pollution bounds to be aggravated, as a result, the health risks will increase.
While the increasing automobiles cause increasing problems, the development of public transportation become extremely necessary. Public transportation may be the best choice to reduce the negative effects of increasing automobiles from different aspects. More developed public transportation system will attract people to choose a public bus or another public vehicle other than driving by themselves. As a result, the number of automobiles on the road will be decreased to some extent. The traffic jams will be relieved to some extent. Of cause, the traffic accidents will be reduced. Studies show that public vehicles have a relative lower accident probability than private ones, because most public transportation drivers are experienced and trained. In addition, fewer automobiles will also result in fewer automotive emissions, which can relieve the destruction of environment. Both from economic and environmental aspects, the development of public transit is in need.
The main benefit of public transit is to reduce the vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which can help to reduce the number of vehicles on road, thus the automotive emissions will be reduced and the traffic congestion will be relieved. As a result, the air pollution caused by automotive emissions will be relieved and the economic loss due to traffic congestion or accidents will be avoided. Study shows that public transit reduces VMT in U.S by approximate 102. 2 billion annually. 3. 4 percent of U.S. annual VMT. (Bailey, Mokhtarian& Little, 2008) To develop public transit is also a method to attract people to use public vehicles instead of private ones, thereby reduce the usage of private vehicles. If the public transportation network is accessible from all directions, more people will prefer to choose public vehicles.
People have reasons to believe that the development of public transit can restrain the increase of automobiles or relieve the problems caused by the increasing number of automobiles. Firstly, public vehicles have higher passenger capacity than private ones. It means that public vehicles are more efficient than private ones, because public vehicles such as bus or train can contain much more passengers and require less space than private vehicles. Figure 1 shows the road space required by different kinds of vehicles. Public vehicles require much less space than private cars, so the development of public transportation can help to solve or relieve traffic congestion and parking congestion. Secondly, public vehicles are of higher safety than private ones. The drivers of public vehicles are trained and experienced and they should pass a series before going to their post. In addition, public vehicles always have their own route and special channels. As a result, public vehicles are always excluded from the traffic jams or traffic accidents. Therefore, to develop public transit will help to reduce the accident incident. Thirdly, the development of public transit will reduce the exhaust of automotive emissions by reducing the VMT and the lower emission ratio of public vehicles. As figure 2 shows, the bus has the lowest emission ration for per passenger among all the vehicles listed, and the more passengers in the bus, the lower emission ration will be. As Bailey, Mokhtarian and Little demonstrate in their study, public transit help to reduce greenhouse gas by 37 million metric tons. (2008) More developed public transit will reduce much emissions and facilitate to solve the environmental problems caused by air pollution. Fourthly, public transit also helps to relieve the energy shortage, especially gasoline shortage. ""The total energy saved, less the energy used by public transportation and adding fuel savings from reduced congestion, is equivalent to 4. 2 billion gallons of gasoline"". (Bailey, Mokhtarian & Little, 2008) While the energy shortage is on the rise, the development of public will contribute to relieve the emergent crisis to some extent. In conclusion, the development of public transit will restrain the rapid increase of automobiles and facilitate to solve or relieve the problems resulted by the excessive increase of automobiles
Figure 2, Road Space By Mode (Banister and Button, 1993)
Figure 2, Lifecycle GHG Emissions, Grams CO2e (Chester and Horvath 2008)
Developed public transit can solve or relieve traffic, environment and energy problems due to the considerable amount of automobiles. Additionally, the public transit also can support more convenience and have more economic benefits than private vehicles for passengers. Most people prefer to choose automobiles rather than public vehicles because they think it saves time and it is more convenient. Actually, public vehicles tend to save more money and time. While most drivers in cities worry the traffic congestion, the passengers who choose public bus or subway are excluded from it, because public vehicles always have their own specific channels. While most drivers complain about the scarce parking space, passengers in public vehicles are not bothered by it. From economic aspects, people who choose public transit no longer need to consider the increasing gasoline price and auto insurance and they no longer need to complain the gasoline wasted in frequent congestion; what they need to do is just paying a little money and enjoy their journey. To choose public transit can help to solve a large amount of problems which bore people who always drive automobiles.
While the number of automobiles is increasing rapidly, the traffic problems, energy shortage, environmental problems and health risks are on the rise. After give full consideration to those problems caused by the too much automobiles, to develop a more perfect public transit is in need. More developed transit will contribute to reduce the VMT, as a result, the environmental, traffic and energy problems will be solved or relieved to some extent. Considered from both solving problems due to massive number of automobiles and private convenience, to develop public transit is necessary.

Argumentative Paper 
Bright Sides of Legalizing Prostitution in South Korea 
Prostitution has been one of the human cultures that have the longest histories, and, at the same time, has been unraveling controversy whether it is right or wrong to have in its own society. But, by catching up on a current world's status with prostitution law, people can clearly see how majority of countries are preferred to reflect their law on the issue. According to 100 countries and Their Prostitution Policies 2015, more than 60% countries are either legalizing or limited legalizing on prostitution. And 30 OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries out of 32 are taking either legalizing or limited legalizing stance on prostitution. Korea is one of the 2 OECD countries that hold illegal prostitution law and there are people who believe that Korea is doing right thing because they think, regardless of how women enter the sex trade, their procurers manipulate and abuse them economically Kim, 2007. It is true that the abuses had happened and could still be remaining some; however, that is a story of at least 20- 30 year ago when Korea was relatively poor country and having a big economical development. As of 2015, Korea is world's 11th largest economy, a member of OECD, and ranks a high value of in terms of ""human development."" Despite its comparably high level of ""development,"" Korea continues to be a major source of trafficked and smuggled in commercial sex trade Yoo, 2009. Then, it can be presumably concluded that the majority women in sex trade are not in desperate situation that they were forced into the prostitution yet volunteered to be in the position. 
Is it nonetheless an effective law not making any better from being a major source of commercial sex trade in the country? It is now time for Korea to take a thoughtful change by legalizing prostitution because it is proven that prostitution is somewhat unavoidable in Korea, illegal prostitution makes huge occupational unfairness, and legalizing prostitution will get Korea benefits in tax and citizen health. 
To be more specific about unproductiveness of illegalized prostitution law, it is helpful realizing deeper investigation on Korea's economic status on sex market. According to the Korean Women's Development Institute 2004, the sex trade generates approximately 1. 6 per cent of GDP, or about $14 billion annually by comparison, South Korea's agriculture industry accounts for roughly three per cent of GDP. An illegalized underground market makes practically around half of a country's agriculture industry? This probe is shamefully revealing prostitution law is not working properly at all and sex market is openly on the surface of the society. Moreover, the amount of 1.6% of country's GDP going just either to sex workers or pimps is a great loss to the country. Not to mention about tax benefit from legalizing prostitution, there are several more critical advantages from it. 
The advantages can be found on the prostitution-legal-experienced countries. Brothels are legal in a number of places over the world including Nevada, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand Weitzer, 2007. Even though statutory regulations vary by countries, those countries' common objective is one, harm reduction. Research suggests that under the suitable conditions, legal prostitution can be organized in a way that raise workers' health, safety, and job satisfaction. Mandatory condom use and other safe-sex practices are ordinary in legal brothels, and the workers would face much lower risk of abuse from customers Weitzer, 2007. 
Lastly and most importantly, illegalized prostitution law could bring down motivation of most ethical citizens who work in their position respecting laws that eventually end up dragging more women to a sex trade industry and inspire angers from hard workers. Under Korea, where under ground sex industry is not well regulated, there is no fear to enter and exit the market, no set market price, and not even a tax imposed on their sex trade. Because of this sweet 'easy money' system, it is even harder for the sex workers, who once have experienced it, to step out. Furthermore, the people who legally work harder, contributing their own money to country, yet getting relatively tiny amount of income would sooner or later get tired of the wrongful situation. 
There is yet no perfect solution on dealing with prostitution, but numerous countries have applied countless different ways in different circumstances over the centuries that they made it easier to pick better option amongst its own cases. Knowing the size of underground market, disadvantages of health, economy, safety, and social norm, there is nowhere to step back anymore and it is indeed time for Korea to pick more valuable option that would satisfy both country and its citizens.

Developing one's ability to read people's facial expressions is important 
No need for solid evidence, no need for polygraph, even no need for any voice, only a little change in one's face is enough to be detected as lying, this is the ability of Dr. Lightman in the TV series 'Lie to me'. This kind of skill might sounds amazing and fancy, but it's impossible or in another word, been exaggerated. However, that doesn't mean that reading facial expressions is useless. Actually, knowing facial expressions and how to read facial expressions is really important to everyone and helps us to live a better life instead of insignificant or even harmful. 
I have asked some of my friends about their view on facial expressions and most of them think that facial expression is not related to our lives. However, actually facial expression is vital in everyone's life. Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. They are a primary means of conveying social information between humans, but they also occur in most other mammals and some other animal species (Alan). Facial expression is probably the earliest form of communication between different people, before written or spoken language, we tend to use facial expressions to express our emotions. People used to be very good at reading facial expressions because people had to read facial expressions because facial expression was people's only 'language' at long time ago. If someone in long time ago meet an animal in the jungle, he would immediately express fear in his face to let people around know that there's danger. Right now because of the development of technology and other ways of communicating or different types of languages' emergence, people are gradually losing this type of ability. As we can see right now, text messages and instant communicating apps are already become a irreplaceable part of our daily language. People are intending to use these 'nonverbal' communication instead of oral communication. According to a new study, 31% of American adults prefer text messages to phone calls (Amy ). We really should develop or more properly, recover our ability of reading facial expressions. 
Although as I mentioned above that people are using less communication, people do use facial expression in another way. We use emoticons to show what we feel on text messages as we use facial expression when we communicate with others. People would send a face with tear to indicate that he is sad or things doesn't go well and a face with joy to clearly show that he is happy. Recently, the oxford dictionary selected 'emoji' as the Word of the Year because they think that a pictographic script like emoji can fill those gaps during our communication -it's flexible, immediate, and infuses tone beautifully. As a result emoji are becoming an increasingly rich form of communication, one that transcends linguistic borders. Although emoji is just face with tears of joy but it's the representative of the 'family of emoji', the popularity of emoji tells us that facial expression still plays a very vital role in our communication. 
On the other hand, recognizing facial expression is also very useful in professional fields and would also serve everyone's life. We all know that the agents of FBI and even some police officers are trained to learn a little basic facial expression to help detect the criminals and potential threats. Although it might not be as accurate in the TV series, it's still very helpful in urgent circumstances. I have interviewed <name> who is an assistant professor in Consumer Science and the Director of the Centre for Professional Selling at Purdue University. Dr. <name> field of research is using the facial expression in sales. By using facial expression analysis and behavior training to tell you what the world see on your face and give you feedback. After the analysis, a businessman can intentionally train himself to behave what he needs to show others which is pretty important on negotiations. This is a very important usage of facial expression for now since facial expression recognition is not mature enough to be used on high-end fields. Also recently, Microsoft's emotion-reading tool is available to developers in beta now. The company's Project Oxford artificial intelligence team has invented emotion-reading technology that uses knowledge of facial expressions to identify specific human feelings in photos. The company released that tool at Microsoft's Future Decoded event on Wednesday, and it has been released in beta to developers. Basically it trains computers to recognize eight core emotional states: anger, contempt, fear, disgust, happiness, neutral, sadness and surprise (Collins) . Although right now it can only be used for entertainment, it's a milestone on the field of emotion-reading. These are very promising fields that 
While even in the brightest sky, there would be some black clouds. Some conservative people would say that developing that kind of technology isn't safe and could be used by some bad people. Some aggressive people might even think that the government would use that technology to spy every US citizen because of the scandal with Edward Snowden. And I think that's correct and understandable, the ability to read facial expression itself is useful and neutral, but it does could be used by people with bad intentions and might cause possible bad consequence because of the recognition of facial expressions like gamblers or conman. But there's always bad people and bad intentions just like a gun could be used by someone for self -defense or could become a murder weapon. As what I can say is, the problem should be how and who to use this technology properly when the technology is powerful enough instead of whether we should develop this technology. The former problem is related to ethical controversies and is definitely beyond my knowledge and capacity. But for the later question, without any doubt, my answer is YES. We can not stop our pace of exploring facial expressions just because of the possible abuse of facial expressions 
In conclusion, it's really important to develop our ability to read facial expression and to develop our technology on reading facial expression. We need more than ever to know what different types of faces mean. It's part of the development of our EQ, knowing others' feeling and make people feel better is always crucial in any situations and make us a better talker. And for professional fields, developing the knowledge and technology to read facial expression is going to make our life safer and more comfortable. Imagine that someday when we have enough database and evidence to build a system to predict people's next move, we can really stop criminals or even terrorists like some episodes in the movies. The episode in the movie or in the TV series will be no longer a dream if we keep our pace properly.

"Foreign Teacher and International Schools 
P5D1 
April 19, 2015 
	In recent years, globalization has become a trend among the world. Numerous western people flood into China every year. According to the Sixth National Census in China, there were 593,832 foreigners came to China in 2010(NBS, 2011). Some of them chose to be teachers in China. As I mentioned before, due to the trend of globalization, more students are willing to study abroad. Some English speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In the latest decade, numerous international schools were founded in China. These schools attract students by the AP/A-Level courses they provide and the foreign teachers in the schools. Since the day that international schools were known by the society, the debate on whether students should go to international schools never end. This paper is focus on the pros and cons of international schools. 
	International schools, through out the recent fifteen years, most of them are British and American style and the teachers in those schools most are from UK and US (Hayden, 2006). Actually, the international schools I discuss in this paper are the schools for students who want to study abroad. Those students are looking for a similar education system like western countries. International schools offer some courses such as AP and A-Level courses. Students could truly learn knowledge in the western systems. They use the imported textbooks and learn all the things in English. The tuition fees of international schools are always higher than normal schools. In China, a normal high school would cost 5,000 RMB per year; an international school would cost 70,000 RMB per year. Some people may think the extremely high cost is not worth. 
The main advantage of international schools is the teacher resources. Most foreign teachers in international schools use English as their first language. Obviously, students go to international schools to acquire original English teaching, foreign teachers are the best roles to teach in English. An international school teacher or educator is someone engaged in the education of pupils in schools other than their country of citizenship. The term generally refers to teachers who are teaching in private or independent schools. Faculties at international schools are usually from or certified by the standards of their country of origin (Savva, 2013). In most international schools in China, each course is taught by a foreign teacher and a domestic teacher. They have separate class but similar knowledge. Students would not only learn things in English but also can ask questions to their Chinese teachers to understand better. This kind of combination could definitely help students get used to English teaching system without misunderstanding of knowledge. 
Another feature of international schools is the abundant activities. In normal Chinese high schools, students do not have enough chance to do some social activities. I was study in an international high school. Except the course works, we had various activities. For example, my school held ""Shark Tank"" in our junior year-it is a program featuring students pitching their business ideas in order to secure investment finance from a panel of venture capitalists. Every student took part in this activity and used their own ideas to set up a virtual company. Through this activity, we utilized knowledge into practice, and had a preliminary impression about how to set up a company. I believe this kind of experience would help me a lot in my future career. 
The people who believe international schools are beneficial think that after graduate from international schools, students could easily be used to their college life in western countries. Indeed, speaking and listening are the most significant skills when students attend college. The first difficulty international students would faced is the understanding of lecture. According to the statistics of Education Department of China, there were 93,768 students go to American universities. More than half of these international students were graduated from international high schools. Some of my friends are from normal high schools in China. At first, they all had some trouble with understanding what the lecture instructor said. Since they never truly experience a lecture taught by an English speaker, they surely would have difficulties with listening. However, students who are from international schools would rarely have the same problem. They are already used to the language used in class. 
Yet some people think international schools are not beneficial. In normal Chinese high school, students could learn lots of Chinese history knowledge and culture. Some traditional poems and articles are essential. Moreover, foreign teachers in international schools need more certification before they start teaching. In 2013, a foreign teacher in an international school in Beijing was reported to be a wanted criminal of England. The lack of regulation is irresponsible to the students. 
In conclusion, international schools in China are still a developing field. For the future of students, attending international schools is beneficial to them.

"Argumentative Essay 
Friends play a huge factor in our lives. In today's society, friends seem to be even more important than ever. We are competing on a global scale, and such a competition requires manpower. Although some people think that parents have more important influence than other people on their success at any time, friends can give more support at this point. However, friends is the most influential factor on student's academics. Friendships can have both positive and negative energy on academic achievement, social and overall happiness in school, time allocated for homework and much more. 
On one hand, it is true that parents play an essential role in our life, they take care of children and teach them lots of things. They really impact so much in their children's, such as they teach child how to eat, how to talk, and how to be a good person, but they can't impact everything in child's life at any time. When one is confused, he will turn on to his parents and get help from them. But when a person grow up, he got into a bigger world and meet more and more types of people, those people will help him and give him advice instead of his parents. Also, a young adult is more likely to accept friend's suggestion than parents. They usually find it is easier to accept ideas from friends, since parents are older and they will have generation gap between each other. Therefore, friends become the most important factor that can influence a person when he left parents and attend to college. 
On the other hand, friends can effect college students on many ways because they always be together on campus. Recently I interviewed my advisor Dr. Morgan about how does friends influence college students and she mentioned that it is easy to learn something from others or changed by others especially those who usually stay with you. For example, when a person study in college, he has no longer live with his parents, which means he is out of control by his parents. So parents can't influence him too much since they don't know what happen to their child. That person met various kind of people every day and finally made several good friends. By compared with parents, he found that friends have so many similar hobbies and ideas with him. Therefore, he is more likely to talk with friends rather than talk with parents. And his friends will give him some advice which may positive and negative. As we all know, a correct suggestion will bring lots of positive energy and save him from trouble. On the contrary, a wrong suggestion may mislead people and let them come to a deadlock. Things will never get better when someone meet a bad friend. 
Moreover, I read an article named ""Are friends important in educational outcomes?"" It shows that students influence each other not only through how teachers respond to him/her, but also in how he/she influences classroom standards. A naughty student is more likely to break the atmosphere of study in classroom, disperse others attention and forcing the teacher to devote more time in class to discipline rather than transmit knowledge. For instance, when someone are talking loudly in the class, student's attention will be attracted. They won't listen to class carefully and maybe will join to talk with each other. As a result, a student's performance may be influenced by the role and behavior of his/her peers. Take Bill Gates for instance, he cooperated with his classmate in university and established the Microsoft which made great contribution to the world. This decision made Bill Gates become the richest person in the world during that period. There are so many similar examples that some of friends become copartners and set up a company to operate. It is not easy to start a business independently, but things will become easier if someone has a copartner to work together. 
From what has been discussed above, I'm strongly convinced that friends play the most important role on students even they are a factor of whether you will success or not. Since students spend their entire school day with friends, and they also play together during weekends and holidays, friends can easily influence each other on every aspect. A good friend will get improvement with you together and a bad friend may be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. Therefore, it is very essential to choose a correct friend by observe one's qualities of character, especially honest, kind, and reliable.

Tobacco Advertising
In the world of advertising there is much debate about whether or not tobacco companies should be allowed to market their products. Here in the United States tobacco ads have been banned from television and radio; however, magazines are still fair game for big tobacco companies. For large tobacco companies such as Philip Morris USA and R.J. Reynolds, advertising has been a great tool for their success. Through the use of fictional characters like Camel Joe and the Marlboro Man, these companies have been able to appeal to younger generations and get them using their products. However, the apparent youthful advertisements from these companies have not gone unnoticed. In recent years, organizations such as ""Truth"", an anti-tobacco organization, have been promoting the disuse of all tobacco products. Anti-smoking and anti-chewing ads have become very popular, being shown in all forms of media such as television, radio, magazines and newspaper, in hopes to reach out to the youth and discourage the use of these products. It is important, though, for these advertisers to understand the youth and realize what appeals to them. There are three main methods that every anti-tobacco ad chooses to take which include: Fear appeals, social norms, and industry manipulation. During the course of this essay I will explain the impact that tobacco advertising has had on the country and how anti-tobacco advertising is making an effort to counter that. Also, I will discuss several organizations that are working to promote the anti-tobacco movement. The youth of this country are exposed to pro-tobacco ads and tobacco use every day, and that is why it is important for advertisers to know how to send unforgettable anti-tobacco messages to the younger generation.
Just like most businesses, the tobacco industry uses advertising as a tool to sell their products. However, because of the dangers associated with their products this has caused much controversy. Authors of the article ""Measuring Exposure to Pro- and Anti-tobacco
Marketing Among Adolescents: Intercorrelations Among Measures and Associations With
Smoking Status"" state that ""Numerous studies have implicated exposure to tobacco-related marketing as one of the risk factors for smoking"" (J. B. Unger et al., 2001). Furthermore, they go on to explain how smoking had increased among young men around 1912 after the introduction of Camel cigarettes and women with the Chesterfield campaign of 1912. (J. B. Unger et al., 2001). Luckily, these numbers have dropped greatly due to known health related risks that were mostly unknown at the time. Oftentimes certain tobacco ads will target a certain group of people and sometimes that means the younger generation. Tobacco companies know how to appeal to the younger crowd in attempts to start them on their product. This has many people outraged in the United States and even in other countries including Canada and across Europe. The United States government decided to do something about it in 1970 when they passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act. This law banned any advertising of cigarettes on the television and radio; however, smokeless tobaccos were not taken off the air until 1986. The United States was not the only country to ban tobacco advertising, Canada joined them. In 1997, Canada passed the Tobacco Act which set rules about where tobacco companies were allowed to run ads. This act stopped tobacco companies from sponsoring any major sporting events and did not allow the companies to advertise in places where children could enter (Advertising ban survives, 2007). However, in the United States tobacco companies are still given permission to advertise in most magazines.
Figure 1 shows that tobacco companies do the majority of their advertising in magazines, spending nearly $300 million in 2003. It is clear that tobacco advertisers are now only able to reach a portion of their audience since the Cigarette Smoking Act. Luckily, the United States recognized this a long time ago and did something about it.
In recent years many organizations and cancer charities have pushed for anti-tobacco messages on the air. They have been successful in that hundreds of ads have been created and are increasing in popularity. These messages are typically aimed at youth in order to prevent them from smoking before they ever start. Studies have shown that in 1998 less than 1% of 11-year-olds smoked on a regular basis whereas nearly 21% of 15-year-olds considered themselves regular smokers. It is clear that an important factor in keeping children from smoking is to turn them away from it as early as possible. (Eadie, Evans, Devlin, Stead, 2007). This is why it is important for anti-tobacco advertisers to target the younger generation. One major contributor to the anti-tobacco movement is the Tobacco Prevention and Control Program. This program has helped reduce Washington States youth smoking rates by 50% since its start in 2000 (Black, 2007). Figure 2 depicts smoking rates across the state of Washington which was surely affected by anti-tobacco advertising which became increasingly popular around 1998. Another organization that made a strong effort in the fight against tobacco was the American Legacy Foundation. Even though they were denied from several networks, the foundation continued on with their $150 million anti-tobacco campaign (Goetzl, Teinowitz, 2000). The ads created by the foundation all had a central tag line which was ""there is only one product that actually kills a third of the people who use it. Tobacco"" (Goetzl, Teinowitz, 2000). Furthermore, with the fourth highest percentage of smokers in the United States, Ohio has also decided to take action (Neff, 2003). The Ohio Tobacco Use Prevention and Control Foundation, created in 2001, has gone to such lengths as to asking MTV to stop showing videos that ""glorify"" smoking and also creating radio advertisements (Neff, 2003). A study done by the Research Triangle Institute shows that adult smoking rates in Ohio have dropped from 27.7% to 26% since the campaign was started in 2001 (Neff, 2003). I believe it is organizations such as these that really understand the importance of anti-tobacco advertising. As important as anti-smoking and anti-chewing ads are, it is equally important that the advertisers are able to appeal to the younger generation.
Just as many pro-tobacco ads do, anti-tobacco advertisements must be able to appeal to a younger generation to prevent them from starting bad habits. Most anti-tobacco ads will choose between using several different methods that include: Fear appeals, social norms, and industry manipulation. A fear appeal is a method that invokes strong emotions from the audience such as consequences of smoking. Often times these ads will show graphic pictures or video that will essentially attempt to scare the person watching into not smoking or chewing. This method is arguably the most effective method to use when creating an anti-tobacco advertisement. According to the authors of the article ""Effects of Anti-Smoking Advertising on Youth Smoking: A Review"", they claim that ""advertisements which elicit strong emotional arousal, typically those that graphically portray the adverse consequences of smoking, often rate highly among teens and adults, and are associated with increased intention not to smoke"" (Flay, Giovino, Nichter, & Wakefield, 2003). Another method used by advertisers is referred to as social norms. Advertisements that use this method often focus on what other people, such as a spouse or a friend, will think of the person smoking (Cohen, Gold, Shumate, 2007). Its objective is to get smokers to believe that smoking is not seen as a positive social norm because it is a disgusting and unhealthy habit. It also makes an effort to persuade the smoker that smoking is not socially acceptable. Finally, the last method that anti-tobacco messages may use is industry manipulation. Its goal is to ""encourage young people to reject tobacco and to harness natural youth rebellion and channel it toward rebelling against the tobacco industry"" (Eadie, Evans, Devlin, & Stead, 2007). In other words, industry manipulation makes an effort to expose how tobacco companies are evil. The organization known to be most popular at using this method is called ""Truth"". They run many different ads stating the different chemicals that go into making a cigarette. Furthermore, the Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi has also dished out their own advertisement involving industry manipulation. The ad consists of a chimpanzee locked inside of a cage inside a laboratory of a tobacco company. This ad symbolizes the mistreatment of animals that tobacco companies use to test their products (Teinowitz, 2000). All of these methods are a great way for advertisers to appeal to a younger generation and counter any pro-tobacco ads they may encounter.
Anti-tobacco advertising is an important tool in reducing the smoking rates across the country. The youth of this country are bombarded with tobacco use every day and they should be aware of the dangers that go along with it. I believe the ad industry is very aware of this problem as the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) has made efforts to sponsor anti-tobacco ads in the past (Teinowitz, 1997). Through the use of fear appeals, social norms, and industry manipulation, advertisers can connect with the younger generation hopefully keep them from using tobacco. So far, these anti-tobacco messages have significantly decreased the smoking rates in many places and that is why people should support these advertisers.

Main Topic In College 
Generally, higher education is useful for most of students who wants to be successful. Collage time would open your mind by some activity, so different culture would make you be more cheerful. It is the way to let you handle yourself, and you need to figure out some question by yourself, For example, to sign a contract with the owner of the house you live in. You may learn some habit to be successful in the collage. Is it necessary to study in collage if you want to be successful. Of course some people who are very successful were drop out off the school without collage time, but only few of the student who dropped out of school were successes, most of them were failed. Some body thinks collage time is a period of time to waste of time they have to spent lot of money but they may work after collage but not the knowledge you have learned. 
Collage is like a warm-up to the real society, makes you prepare for some challenge you do not know. In college, we have a great environment of studying. When your classmates, your roommate and people who you are living with are donating their time on studying, you will be impressed by them and be involved in studying. In this kind of communication you will learned how to choice the environment you live or study in. That would be more benefit to improve yourself when you life in an real society. These is an ability you can not buy or study by yourself. Some people think college kids always party all day, and waste time and money during the college. Even they think college is the beginning ourself of corruption. But I don't think so at all. I admit some people always drug or party all day, but this is part of our society. When we grow up we will met lot of temptation, if you really know that is not good you will keep away from those things. College is like a mini society, they are different groups people, some are party animals, some are hardworking guys. You could predict their future according to their life. Most hardworking guys will get a good job after graduation at least, if they met an inspirational flash or a mystic spell of luck, they will get success easily. 
College is a prefect place to make your dream come true. A lot of times, inspirational flashes appear to the front of our eyes, but we always miss them. We have lots of chance in our life to be successful. Many people can not hold at first time, but Failure is the mother of success.I have learned this in the my fresh year. People always have lots of reason to explain their failure. Just like I do|n't have enough people to help me, or I don't know some professional skill, but when we are at college, we will get a lot resources on the professional skill support. Jake Ma, one of the most famous businessmen in China, He said ""the most important time in my life is collage time , and my friends. I can not be successful without them."" He majors in English, but he is a man who were study very hard in management, his college buddy majors in computer sciences. Jake wanted to build Chinese yellow page, his idea is so prefect if we look at it now, through he didn't know much on computer science, but at that time, in his college his friends provide a lot of help to him, also he a good leader when he was in college, so he knew this society so well. If he did not study in collage,China's electricity may back ten years. maybe So many teenagers in college are also creating amazing things, that's why college looks so charming and attractive. 
College years will give you some sincerely friends. These kind of friends will help you to be successful, no one could be successful by himself. One of the king in the China said:""a log could not support all the world. College, a small society is the last time before you step in a real society. Some people think it is hard to make friends in college, because after graduation, everyone will be separated by the time and place. If you have not studied in collage, you may met some new friend, but that is more difficult to know them without study together and hangout together. This way will not met real friends, you need some special place and time to know each other just like collage. If you do not study in collage, you will not live in this situation. I think college life will be the most beautiful time in one's life. A group of teenagers chase dream together will be the most cheerful thing in the world. You spend time with college friends everyday, study with them , eat and have fun together. Many years later, this still will be a unforgettable memory. Also, your college friends will be separated at all kinds of careers. A successful man always needs help at some times. Minghong Yu, the CEO of New Oriental, when he established this school, he do not have enough money to start it, his college friends lended him some, and some friends took part in his company. Because of enough money support, his company grow up strongly and became famous in the world. He was one the most influential people in China in 2013. 
Before I came to Purdue, I took lot of question and doubt to here, but now I know what should I do, this is the most important time in my whole life, every day is. Everybody need this period of time to record the best time in their life, In my opinion the most important is not how much We can learn or how many people we can met. Collage is a small society the place you could learn how to protect yourself. I hope I could learn something really useful, The most important youth everybody would have youth and It past so fast, and collage is the most important time in every body's life. Do not be regret when the time pasted

Psychology Regenerates People 
	Psychology is an amazing science that lies beyond every person that has ever existed in this world. People live in harmony because of psychology, they imagine, they see and they forecast thanks to psychology. Even though most of the people feel that it's a boring social class that is only worth to kill time Psychology is an amazing life class that extends people's perspective. It teaches how to live, how to see and how to believe. After learning Psychology people will have improved a bunch of skills. 
Psychology needs to be learned by everyone because it gives a new perspective we say but what kind of perspective does the psychology really grants us? What enables us to see the bigger picture? To answer a question like that I can tell a great example of history ""Fan Zhonyan"". According to the Fan Zhonyan story (Yang pg 1 - 10) Fan encounters many challenges and difficulties in his life. After a certain point he loses his joy to live and his ability to be happy. While his life seems unbearable he realizes the bigger picture. With his instincts he creates a psychologic approach and he finds the source and sorrow of the people. He decides to heal the world with what he sees and observes. Eventually he becomes a better person and his benevolence changes the people around him in a good way. Even though Fan Zhonyan didn't learned Psychology he acts like a true psychologist. Maybe on of the reasons he had to find out Psychological approach in a tougher way was the fact that Psychology didn't exist that years. Luckily we do have a chance to learn Psychology and heal the people around us. Making a positive difference in this world will make us happy and peaceful. Psychology not only heals people but also grants a new perspective. According to my interviews with a professional psychologist there were many other methods to understand human behavior and accordingly we have many opportunities to understand the person we are interested in. This is a great opportunity that needs to be exploited. Accessing inner persona (inner self) enables us to be closer to the other people. Psychology gives us passion because Psychology enables us to change human personality. According to the interview I had with one professional, with right techniques and right motivations we could be able to change any person's personality. Having a power like that is amazing and great. 
Even though Psychology seems unbeatable it has weaknesses. Sometimes Psychology leads to wrong decisions and wrong acts. For example, in order to understand human mind, the techniques sometimes can lead to wrong decisions. Consequently, we might act to the person in a different way that he or she wants to be treated. One of the other weaknesses that Psychology has is that it can change someone's personality. Politicians or other oppressive people can abuse this power and can be able to brainwash the people to vote for them. Psychology has seriously dangerous powers. Another problem with psychology is that sometimes it may lead to be cocky in front of the people. Since the people who took psychology can think that they know everything and anyone they see they might go forward and be cocky. These problems could lead to serious problems in society. 
Like everything in this world Psychology has medicines for it's own poisons. First of all, Psychology needs practice without practice like anything else in this world every method of Psychology would fail. Consequently, a person needs to practice fully in order to comment about other people. While Psychology has the power to change one's personality it can also teaches people how to protect their own unique responses. By teaching how to avoid corruptions Psychology gives protection to people. People can act cocky but this is not because of Psychology. On the contrary Psychology teaches people to respect, observe and to be able to see the beauty in one. Like any other thing in the world everything has weaknesses but Psychology is different from others. It teaches how to protect yourself against the dangers and problems. 
Finally, Psychology is an amazing lifetime opportunity that everyone needs to exploit. It teaches great techniques and grants one a whole new perspective. It has weaknesses but also it teaches people to how to defend themselves against its own unique tricks. In order to be a kind and insightful person everyone needs to learn psychology.

To Some Extent College Students Should Not Always Challenge Authority 
Usually people are regarded to have independent idea from their tens, because since then, they will not simply follow instructions from their parents or teachers. In fact, according to IB Theory of Knowledge teacher Amy Li in Shude High School, students tend to challenge information from authorities since their high school age. This phenomenon has been encouraged by most people for long time. However, most college students do not have the ability to do so and there is not false to follow authorities for college students. In fact, challenging is not always the best way for students to deal with information from authorities. Considering reasons above, challenging authorities, in most of cases, is actually not necessary for college students. 
Almost every college student does not have enough ability to challenge authorities. For most of college students, although they may have their specific major, they are obviously not expertise in such field. They still have a lot to learn. Under such condition, not every student has enough knowledge background to challenge their professors. In fact, from professor Jack Spencer, in most of cases what students usually do is to question what contradictory with what they think they know. In this situation, there actually is no need to challenge, students probably should simply ask questions or ask more detailed explanations. Besides academic field, college students are really new to society or life, they also do not have the knowledge to doubt authorities in their daily life. For example, there is no need to challenge doctors in hospital. Doctors have professional knowledge for medicine or diseases, but most of college students only have experience from their parents or friends. In such case, why should a college student to challenge information from such authority? 
On top of that, obedience, following authorities, is important for not only college students but also for society as a whole. ""Obedience is a part of the foundation of society. Without obedience, naught would exist but chaos and anarchy. Without stability, productivity and the well-being of the citizens become non-existent."" Here, reasonable obedience will provide students productive classes and ordered environment. Apart from that, obedience benefit students to learn. ""Skinner, perhaps the most important behaviorist, argues that it is not a question of whether or not a student is shaped to exhibit particular behaviors. The only issue is who and what will do the shaping, and for what ends. Obedience is a key means of fostering the implantation of desired goals through appropriate shaping, whether or not the student is aware of all the dynamics of the reaming environment."" Hence, for college students, obedience to advisor, professor, or parents is helping them to build a structured knowledge background, to gain a greater academic achievement. 
The correct way for college students to deal with information from authorities is to be critical. Although there might be similarities between critical thinking and challenging, critical thinking is not simply to challenge. In the article Teaching for Critical Thinking: Helping College Students Develop the Skills and Dispositions of a Critical Thinker. Diane F. Halpern defined critical thinking as ""the kind of thinking involved in solving problems, formulating inferences, calculating likelihoods, and making decisions."" (1999) That is to say, critical thinking instead of an ability is way of thinking. College students should have their opinion towards information from authorities, other than simply show off their intelligent and to mean to provide opposite opinions. After carefully thinking about information from authorities, students still could choose methods such as ask questions, seek further information and so on to deal with information from authority instead of simply showing disagree and challenge. 
In short, challenging authorities is not always good for students. As a college student, we need to be rational and critical. Showing off the ability of debating is not the proper way for us to deal with information from authority.

Argumentative Essay 
As winter approaches, millions of high school students around the world are relentlessly trying to improve their test scores in one of the most popular college admission tests, the SAT. Many of them are conscious that a single test can be the determining factor on where they will study and earn their professional degree. However, not many of them have stopped and realized that the SAT might be inaccurate when it comes to showing what students know and whether they will be successful in college or not. 
The primary purpose of standardized testing, as its name suggests, is to measure students under the same questions and material. Universities can't rely solely on GPA since it can greatly vary depending the school, country or even grading system. In that case, standardized testing is a great method to compare students that come from different backgrounds and learning environments (<name>, personal communication, October 20, 2015). Based on some famous scholars such as Robert Barro, there are other advantages of the SAT that are worth pointing out. Barro (2001) suggests why universities should keep using the SAT. Although numerous people have argued that the SAT is ineffective for evaluating applicants, studies from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) show that admission test scores strongly predict college grades. On the other hand, for those that believe the SAT is a disadvantage to minorities, test scores have the same predictive power within an ethnic group as they do in the overall population. This is why Robert J. Barro, a professor of economics at Harvard University, states that colleges should keep the SAT since it is a good predictor of grades in college and wages after graduation without being a disadvantage depending on gender or ethnicity. 
Although the SAT has some advantages worth mentioning, there are many more disadvantages that make us doubt about the test and whether some changes should be done. The flaws of the SAT can be separated into three major categories: it doesn't include certain subjects, it is a disadvantage for low income families, and it doesn't provide information on who is more intelligent or will be more successful. 
	The SAT tests students only in math, reading, and writing sections. It doesn't take into consideration subjects regarding liberal arts or science, which means students that are strong in them aren't able to show what they know. <name> and <name>, who are freshman students from Purdue University, described how they felt they could've scored higher if they were tested on subjects regarding their majors. Unlike other famous standardized tests, the SAT doesn't include subjects such as chemistry, which are fundamental for certain careers. 
	On the other hand, the SAT is a big disadvantage for low income families. Bob Schaeffer, the director of the National Center for Pair and Open Testing, says ""There is still a strong, direct relationship between family income and test scores."" Since the SAT is a test that can be studied for, families with a higher income tend to have tutors and classes for the children in order to increase test scores. Likewise, families that have low income are not able to afford prep-classes and are at a great disadvantage at getting high SAT scores. 
	On the last category, the SAT is clearly not able to prove who is more intelligent or who will be more successful. Just as a student from Haverford School said, ""But do these test prep courses or private tutoring sessions actually make you smarter? Of course not. A student who starts off at 2000 and is able to score 2200 after two months' worth of tutoring sessions is likely not at all more intelligent or more capable of handling a college workload than he was two months before. He has simply grown familiar with the test after taking a dozen practice tests, he has systematically memorized a few hundred vocabulary words that he will forget in half a year's time, and he has brushed up on some grammar and math rules that he had learned before and forgotten, a process that will repeat itself once again. The simple fact that a score can be altered through learning certain techniques and becoming familiar with the test exposes its imperfection and gives reason to doubt its overall effectiveness (Antanavicius, 2011)"" The SAT is a test that can be studied for and that does not measure how students will do in college. In fact, the University of California- Berkeley decided to cut the SAT in the admission process because there was no direct correlation between freshman year grades and SAT scores (Chan, 2012) 
	After a thorough research about the SAT and its contributions, it is clear that standardized testing and specifically the SAT have some benefits worth recognizing. Nonetheless, the amount of disadvantages this test brings far exceeds the amount of advantages it does. The test doesn't include certain subjects, it is a disadvantage for low-income families and it does not show who is smarter or will be more successful in college. Therefore, potential solutions to this problem would be using subject tests more often or putting more weight on high school transcripts for admission processes.

"Advantages and Disadvantages of Food Therapy 
Food therapy is defined as a way of dieting rooted in Chinese understanding of effects of food on human organisms and can treat some kinds of diseases in a slow progress based on traditional Chinese medicine theory. On the other hand, medical treatment is a treatment that only uses medicines and often has a short period to recover from all kinds of diseases. From one peer-reviewed journal article, on dietitian from Hong Kong, China indicates that food therapy compared to medical treatment has abundant advantages and this use of dietary modification in disease is prevalent among Chinese people. (Koo, 1984) And in my personal opinion, food therapy is a high-quality way to treat diseases can be demonstrated from three perspectives: brings a healthier life to human beings, is painless compared to traditional medical treatment, and has a lower cost of recuperating. 
First and foremost, food as a treating substance must be safer and has less negative effects compared to medicines while provides necessary nutrition for growing and staying health at the same time. As we all know, medicines come from chemical material synthesis and not all the chemical substances are good for our body. Recently, I read a peer-reviewed journal article; the authors indicate that most of the hypertension medicines often have some side effects to rest part of the body, especially the heart. (Sacks & Campos, 2010) Then if patients choose to use food therapy, it will be safer and usually has no side effects. 
Secondly, people just eat fresh and delicious food to treat diseases seems less painful than having bitter medicines or terrible operations. As far as I am concerned, eating is an enjoyable thing. Imagine that patients just eat the food and the nutrition brought by food help patients recovered from diseases, what a wonderful thing. That is actually what food therapy works. For example, if a person has serious cold, doctors tell the person to have a lot of bitter pills to release the painful brought by cold, but eating such a terrible medicine is another painful. However, people who use food therapy to cure cold will only request to have ginger with sugar, an old way told generation by generation to treat cold. I believe ginger with sugar is much tasty than medicines. Also a newspaper writer indicates that it's better to eat than pop in medicines. (Walia, 2011) 
Last but not least, food is a common substance in daily life and the price of fundamental food materials for treating and keeping health is absolutely cheaper than the price of medicines, some chemical synthesis for recovering. When people are sick, they often choose to have some medicines to cure diseases. These medicines always cost a lot of money. I remember that I spend almost 100 RMB to buy medicines just for a slightly cold one time. Sometimes, when people have more serious diseases, like heart disease and diabetes, it will cost more on medicines, even 1000 RMB one period. In contrast, food as a daily intake substance is absolutely cheaper. If people use food therapy to treat diseases, it will cost less because whenever people have disease or not, they always need to eat. 
On the other hand, food therapy also has some disadvantages. Many people think that food therapy isn't effective enough compared to general medical treatment since the treat process of food therapy is too slow and treat result is not obvious. In ancient China, there is just one method to cure disease that is traditional Chinese medicine which also includes food therapy. With the development of western medicine in China, more and more people realize that this treatment takes short period of time to recover and seems more effective, and then they gradually choose western medicine to treat instead of fundamental food therapy, a slow process of treating. Another disadvantage of food therapy is the local limitation. Food therapy is based on traditional Chinese medicine and just familiar with Chinese people. That means that most of the dieticians and patients from other countries never heard of food therapy in fact. I had an interview with a nutrition professor in Purdue University. She told me that dietitians use another way called medical nutrition therapy, a treatment that people use to treat diseases based on the different stages of diseases in U.S and she never knew about food therapy and traditional Chinese medicine theory. 
Although food therapy seems ineffective and cannot known by people all over the world to become a main treatment as soon as possible, I still believe that food therapy is a competitive treatment from healthy, painless and economic these three points. Undoubtedly, food therapy needs a lot of further researches to perfect the therapy and make it suit to more situations. I also hope that food therapy as a traditional Chinese treating method can be spread from China to other countries and combined with different kinds of food and nutrition theories, and then be completely developed and widely used.

April 8, 2016 
	In this day and age, usage of social media has been a common situation in human lives by its convenience of contact, functions of life sharing and entertainment. At the same time, lots of effects are carried out by social media. After I did the research and interview, I found that some people are inclined to be strong believers in the extreme claim that usage of social media brings positive effect on human. Perhaps sound and attractive as their argument seems, but it can hardly bear closer analysis. Accordingly, I, without hesitation, advocate that effect of usage of social media is negative on account of the following reasons and examples. 
	Firstly, social media can create many distractions for college students when studying. To be more specific, social media has become one of the technique of studying such as blackboard, online class and homework submit. One research mentioned in this article showed the usage of social media of studying because the result showed that nearly 100 percent of college students used the Internet for academic purposes(1). Actually, most students can not put all of their attention into studying while social media is used as the studying technique according to the survey of 1774 college students in America. The result was 51 percent, 33 percent and 21 percent of these college students reported texting, using Facebook, and emailing when doing schoolwork.(1). Another study showed the higher rate distraction caused by social media, 85. 9 percent students in U.S colleges and 72. 5 percent European students diverted their attention when using social media to do schoolwork(1). All the researches indicate social media becomes a wide use method to college students, but it can make students divert attention when using it to study. 
	Secondly, usage of social media become a medium of cyber bullying, and it can carry out serious problems. Social media provide the best way for people to share their feelings, emotions, and their personal pictures with friends, family, and even the public. Cyber bullying happen when personal pictures videos are used to make fun, get abusive posts by others and get some negative comments under posted pictures. Actually, it has become a common and serious problem in society. A survey of 613 college students if they have cyberbullying experiences. As a result, 35 percent of them were cyberbullied before during social media.(2)Another result indicated 55 percent of teenagers get cyberbullied during the use of social medial.(3) Under the condition of the wide-happen of cyberbullying, it harm students a lot according to my interview with Mr <name> In his option, he thinks college students could feel deep blue when they face cyberbullying, and few of them want to share this with families or teachers so they will keep the upset in their minds.(4) A very famous cyberbullying case was The Megan Meier Case. Tina's 13-year old girl hanged herself in the bedroom closet to end her life because she was cyberbullied by a boy named Josh Evans on the social networking website My Space.(5) Usage of social media makes lives become funny, but it also brings cyberbullying which is really harmful to people. 
	Thirdly, there is a strong connection between the usage of social media and the formation of self-concept. According to the article University students' Motivated Attention and use of regulation strategies on social media., the Pearson Correlation between the usage of social media and students' self-concept is 0.658. It seems like 0. 658 is a small number, but in the scale of Pearson number between -1 and 1, it actually indicates a strong correlation between the two factors. From my perspective, it is unwise for a human being to depend so largely on the social media when a college student is trying to build self-concept and we cannot let social media to manipulate us especially mentally. Self-concept gives rise to personal value, and it can motivate personal behavior(7) People who have good self-concept can maximize the results because they know what their abilities are, and what they can do(7) As a result, in today's life full with social media, even a college student might get lost and started to be doubtful about his life. It is necessary to restrict the usage of social media because the severe consequences brought by the misusage are dreadful. 
	In conclusion, I believe that we should use less or depend less on social media because it brings many unexpected results. Social media brings distractions for our academic life because it is addictive and those with weak self-control might get lose in the social media world. It is also the medium for cyberbullying, one of the worst things could happen on campus. Cyberbullying could destroy a student mentally and lead him/her to commit suicide. Last but not the least, social media weight too much on people's formation of their self-concepts and it is just simply not wise to value social media excessively. What I mean is not to ban social media, but to restrict it.

"Changing Experience for Chinese Students 
Nowadays, a second large wave of studying abroad is currently underway in China. The number of Chinese international students in the United States keep increasing, and Chinese students became the majority of international students in American universities. However, there are still many misunderstanding about Chinese students, and the most common one is to consider all of the Chinese students undergo a severe psychological depress when they first come to the United States, which is also called ""culture clash"". Compared the Chinese international students decades ago, the current Chinese students actually experienced little culture clash. 
According to Daniel Chirot, a professor of International Studies and of Sociology in University of Washington, the major causation of this situation is policy change. He indicated that after the ""open the door"" policy, people in China got to know the information about foreign countries including the United States through many ways such like American movies, novels and US Television series. Moreover, the policy change also stimulated the economic growth. More people can afford traveling or studying abroad, and people who plan to go abroad can know many knowledge about foreign customs and lifestyles through those who have been to abroad. Therefore, people who will go to the United States, to some degree, are well-prepared, even though sometimes they do not realize it. 
Professor Daniel Chirot also argued that advanced technology recent years has contribute to this situation by allowing people in different countries exchange their values and opinions. Daniel Chirot said that although there are still many people regard China as conservative, traditional and exclusive, China is trying to be open. Benefit by the technology, Chinese people can communicate with foreigners and people living abroad through social network, and learn a lot about foreign life, even though they do not know each other in their real life. These communications actually are the exchange of values, and you can know how a person from another country see a same thing differently, which attributes to the better understanding of foreign cultures by Chinese people. 
There are some studies argue that Chinese international students still experience hard time of adjustment. For example, the 2011 study, ""Chinese students' experience at an American university,"" shows that Chinese students' experience of culture shock is majorly presented in terms of academic experience, socialization, and cultural adaption. However, in a 2012 study of ""Acculturative adjustment patterns among Chinese international students,"" the author pointed out that there is no single study of international students' accumulative adjustment with the consideration of personal differences among individuals. According to the author, even students from a single country have different language ability, acculturation status, and familiarity of American culture, and these differences can make a big difference in adjustment period. The author also mentioned the Berry's (1997) assertion of the importance of studying existing factors prior to acculturation; in fact, Berry said that any study that ignores any personal variables (in this case, may be pre-existing psychological distress) will be incomplete, and will be unable to comprehend individuals who are experiencing acculturation. 
Besides the personal differences, the author of ""Acculturative adjustment patterns among Chinese international students"" also emphasized the importance of using updated data. We can know from above that because of policy, people nowadays have more knowledge and information about foreign life than people in decades ago. Therefore, using updated data is necessary to a study with accurate outcome. The author of 2012 study indicated that most studies about culture clash experienced by Chinese international students based on the data that collected decades ago, which is a major causation of incorrect outcome. 
The 2012 study, ""Acculturative adjustment patterns among Chinese international students,"" which used updated data with the consideration of both longitudinal aspects and personal differences, shows us that majority of Chinese international students nowadays do not experience sever psychological distress during their initial cultural transition to the United States, some of them even show a decrease in their level of psychological depress. Therefore, overall Chinese students nowadays actually have a smoother transition period. 
To sum up, the studies of Chinese students' acculturative adjustment process need to consider not only the personal differences among students, but also the data used in study. China is moving forward and ignorance of the changes of times may lead to inaccurate results of the study.

Diverse Alternatives Arise from Two-child Policy 
In recent months, two-child policy has been a popular topic of discussion in China. When in the subway, I usually heard people said that two-child policy came into effect, and they could have two lovely children. In my view, two-child policy will be a benefit policy for single children, but it will not be a feasible policy to solve social problem China have confronted now. At the present time, plenty of people believe that two-child policy will be an effective policy to fix China's aging workforce and shrinking population. However, on the basis of what l have learned, two-child policy will be only able to slightly alleviate the social issues in a short term. 
Many people believe that two-child policy can permanently counter the aging problem and shrinking population in China because people can have two children. In the case, China will have higher birth rate and more workforce. However, according to the estimated data on population trends in China 2016, Zhao & Gao pointed about that China's population would continue to grow until 2024 and then gradually decline. This means the aging problem and lack of workforce will reoccur 
Zhao & Gao, 2014 
after 2024. There are three reasons to explain that phenomenon and prove that two-child policy will not be an effective policy to resolve aging workforce and shrinking population. First of all, owing to the meteoric development of biology and medical, people are going to have further extension of life span Zhao & Gao, 2014, p. 665. The lower death rate means the elderly population in total population won't decrease. China will still be the ageing society. Secondly, at the presents, feminism is a popular topic around the world. Women have higher social status and have more freedom to choose whether or not to born children. Some of female believe that if they have two children, it will have impact on career development. Last of all, Since the birth of children, parents need to provide them with milk powder, diapers and abundant nutritious food. Even though tuitions of public schools in China are cheap, parents need to pay heavy costs for remedial classes which are not affordable for low-class families. The expensive costs will cause many parents don't have ability to have two children. A survey shows that many Chinese parents intend to have one children instead of two children because of financial burdens. Stuart Gietel Basten, 2016. In conclusion, two-child policy will not be a feasible policy to fix aging workforce and shrinking population. 
Two-child policy will change single children' personality and daily life. Since l were a child, l wanted to have siblings who can share with me their happiness and sorrow. Whenever l saw most of the foreign children have siblings, l was really envious of them. Whenever when l faced with many complex math problems, l thought it would be nice if l had a smart brother or sister. Whenever l felt afraid after l watched horror movies, l expected to have a sibling who can accompany me and give me comfort. Having siblings will change the personality of single children. Nowadays, most of the Chinese children just think about themselves, even not respect other's advices. Having siblings can help them to be more cooperative and generous instead of being egocentric and withdrawn. Furthermore, when single children' parents and grandparents get older or get serious illness, no one can help them to take care with their relatives. They need to ask for a long break which might influence their career development. If they have siblings, they will not become too exhausted and have less financial burden in medical fees and treatment fees. Fortunately, two-child policy improve single children' personality and daily life. 
To summarize, people should be convinced that two-child policy will not counter the aging workforce and shrinking population, due to the faster development of medical and biology, the higher social status of female and the expensive costs of having children. Thus, l positively believe that the aging workforce and shrinking population will not be fixed in a long term. Importantly, two-child policy is beneficial to single children. Singe children will become more persist and less selfish, and having siblings can help them take care with their parents and grandparents which reduce their mental and financial pressure. Two-child policy will be a helpful policy for single children, but not for society.

Health Insurance Marketplace: The Drawbacks 
	We all want the best for ourselves, our loved ones and our properties. Therefore, we do our best to protect ourselves and our loved ones from unfortunate accidents and mishaps. However, there are times when we were unable to protect ourselves and our precious belongings from natural disasters, dangers and accidents. Due to our crucial need of security, we purchase insurance as a form of protection against unfortunate incidents for instance, vehicle accidents, bodily injuries and diseases. Well, insurance does not protect us directly against these incidents like an armor does but it works as a guarantee that the expenses incurred from these accidents will be taken cared off. As we know, health insurance is one of the most important type of insurance. However, not all people afford to purchase one because of financial difficulty and lack of information. In order to make health insurance affordable to those with financial difficulty, Health Insurance Exchange (Obama Care) was introduced. This program was also introduced to curb the insanely huge profits of for-profit health insurance providers and to ensure that insurance companies provide better quality insurance with an affordable price. Even though Obama Care is a program pregnant with a lot of social benefits, I still think that the benefits do not outweigh its costs due to several reasons which I will present in the following paragraphs. 
	A lot of Obama Care supporters believe that it is a good program that helps tens of millions of uninsured Americans to gain access to an affordable, high quality health insurance through Health Insurance Marketplace. Over half of uninsured Americans can also get free or low cost health insurance and some can get help on out-of-pocket costs using state's Health Insurance Marketplace. However, to realize this noble cause, the Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to purchase health insurance, but with subsidies to make sure the insurance are affordable. Why is it mandatory for everyone to purchase health insurance? Well, based on my interview with <name> , Health Insurance Marketplace works by using the Law of Large Numbers which means a large number of participants are required to spread costs evenly and to reduce the cost of insurance by attracting younger, healthier people into the program. It is undeniably a good social cause however a lot of people disagree with the implementation of this program because the government introduces new taxes on medical devices and pharmaceutical sales (Roland J., 2015). This program also berates some parties such as high earners, large businesses and health insurance providers since these new taxes affect them. 
	In another perspective, a lot of Obama Care proponents believe that this initiative helps to control the insanely skyrocketing profit of health insurance providers and at the same time protects clueless consumers from insurance companies' tactics that might increase patient healthcare costs or restrict their healthcare coverage. According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), insurance industry's profits in the third quarter of 2015 was $44 billion which was $6. 2 billion more than the profit earned in the first nine months of 2014. The $44 billion in 2015 was the highest nine months total since 2007 (Hartwig, 2016)! It is undeniably true that some of these insurance companies make huge profits in providing insurance protection to consumers however, even with the implementation of Obama Care, do the consumers really benefit economically? 
For this assignment, I asked a lot of my American friends on their opinions towards Obama Care and a lot of them said that they are more willing to pay for the fine imposed for not purchasing the insurance since it is relatively cheaper than the cost of purchasing one. Besides, some insurance companies and healthcare providers are planning to withdraw themselves from this program because they are losing profits. For example, based on an article titled ""How an Insurance Company Screwed Up on Obamacare"" on the Los Angeles Times website, the executives of the United Health Group which is the United States' biggest private healthcare provider threatened to leave the Health Insurance Marketplace (Obama Care) as early as 2017 because they have been losing millions of profit due to Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange plans (Hiltzik M., 2016). Due to the pressure faced by insurance companies to maintain the unrealistically low cost of exchange plans, providers are being reimbursed at financially unsustainable rates thus causing a lot of physicians and hospitals to decline to accept insurance plans issued through exchanges. Ironically, this refusal to provide affordable care negates the intention of this program to make health insurance accessible to all. Another issue that is good to look out for is not only does insurance providers, hospitals and physicians are opting out from Obama Care, some families who were previously insured before the ACA resort to opt out from this program. They did that because they discovered that it is more reasonable to pay the individual mandate penalty and purchase regular health care than to pay for monthly premiums for an insurance coverage which physicians and hospitals are opting out from (La Couture B., 2014). 
	Apart from that, Obama Care is believed to help employees of businesses with more than 50 employees to get health insurance coverage by awarding them with tax credits to help lower their costs. This action is undeniably good to improve employees' social benefits however, it is projected that another 3 to 5 million people could lose their company-sponsored health care plans since these businesses will find it more cost-effective to pay the penalty and let their employees purchase their respective insurance plans on the Health Insurance Exchange. Apart from that, based on a report by Congressional Budget Office (CBO), it is estimated that there will be 2. 3 million fewer full time workers by 2021 as a result of the ACA-a bad sign for the growth of the economy (The Effects, CBO, 2012, para 3). This is because some workers will choose to forgo employment after obtaining coverage under the ACA, while some employees will voluntarily reduce their working hours. They do that because as their income rises, they will have lesser insurance subsidies and they may even have to pay for the new taxes like the high earners, so the workers will have less incentive to work more or at all. There is also a probability that the employers will cut employees' hours, hire fewer workers or offer lower wages to new employees to avoid or compensate for a new fine on employers that do not pay for insurance of employees who work more than 30 hours per week (Goldfarb & Goldstein, 2014). 
	As a conclusion, Obama Care is indeed a program intended to increase the social benefits of low to moderate income individuals and small businesses. However, it has some major drawbacks as the result of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act which brings benefit to the poor but burdens the health insurance companies, hospitals, high earners and not to forget, the economy. Even though it is still early to judge the effectiveness of this program, we can clearly see how this program has some negative effects that will bring loss to a lot of parties in both short run and long run. The negative effects include implicit taxes imposed as a result of the healthcare subsidies, falling profits of health insurance companies, reimbursement at financially unsustainable rates and the attitude of a group of employees and employers who take advantages on the health insurance subsidies for their own benefits which in the long run will hurt the economy of the United States. 
So, the government must be tactful in handling these negative implications by increasing the fine on employers who deliberately cut employees' working hours or offer lower wages to new workers so they will take their employees' welfare seriously. Apart from that, I think that the government must also be considerate to the insurance companies involved in the exchange program by lifting certain burden from them like unrealistically low insurance price to maintain their interest to cooperate under this program.

"The Indispensability of Traditional Meeting 
Lots of companies use virtual meeting to communicate within companies, however, I think online meeting cannot replace traditional meeting to enhance the connection between headquarters and subsidiaries of companies. Virtual meeting is a way that managers can have conference by the online program. The other way is the traditional meeting that managers hold conference in a specific location and talk face-to-face. Although online meeting has many advantages, the vital status of traditional meeting cannot be replaced. The utilization of traditional meeting can enhance the connection between headquarters and subsidiaries; moreover, meeting workers face-to-face can improve the employees' loyalty to companies, in addition, traditional meeting has better effect than online meeting. 
Traditional meeting plays an important role to strengthen the connection between headquarters and branch companies. According to Loppacher, Cagliano and Spina (2010), managers in headquarters send trustworthy auditors or executives to subsidiaries to check financial performance and conduct conference to listen to the reports. Auditors and Executives meet employees in person in subsidiaries can help managers in headquarters know the most reliable information of branch companies. In the face-to-face conference, employees in subsidiaries can talk more details about the performance of branch companies; also, subordinates in branch companies can ask any doubts to the executives or auditors from headquarters; moreover, executives can deliver the expectation from the managers in headquarters. If auditors find any data that need to be interpreted, a face-to-face meeting is the most effective way to ask questions and solve their confusion on time. However, if auditor did not visit subsidiaries instead of checking financial report online, they have no chance to ask question on time if they are confused with financial report. So tradition meeting can help auditors who visit subsidiaries to solve some specific problems efficiently. 
Meeting employees in person can improve workers' loyalty to companies. My interviewee <name> said that executives could encourage employees by the visit of branch companies. The encouragement of executives can motivate employees to work harder and promote the morale of workers. The more energy and endeavor that employees put into the company, the more loyalty they have to the company. In the traditional meeting, most employees have the chance to meet managers in person rather than communicate by inanimate computer. The living human own the attraction that abiotic technology can never have. The tedious working life of employees needs some thing to stimulate so that workers feel more comfortable to work. Also, if employees feel they are unable to finish some assignments and they doubt their working ability, they can schedule a traditional meeting to talk to managers about their difficulties. So managers can give more instructions about the mission and stimulate employees to make sure they do not lose the confidence. Workers' loyalty is essential for a company to develop better, and the traditional meeting can enhance the loyalty of employees, so managers must meet subordinates in person to encourage them and increase their morale. 
In recent years, many companies use virtual meeting to communicate within companies. Online meeting is convenient and can decrease the transportation and miscellaneous fees if sending executives or auditors to branch companies. Also, online meeting does not limit the location of meeting. Workers can have virtual meeting anytime and anywhere. For example, the head office of a company is in British, the company has three affiliates that are in different countries respectively, managers of each affiliates and the head office can use online meeting program to have conference without going to a particular location. Another advantage of online meeting is that it saves time and takes advantage of time efficiently. Some international companies have subsidiaries that are distant from headquarters, so auditors or executives waste much time to go to branch companies. If they use online meeting, they can use the time they go to subsidiaries to have virtual meeting in order to take advantage of time efficiently. However, the online meeting does not have such good results compare to traditional meeting. Although online meeting saves time, it cannot attain such good effect that traditional meeting have. Managers in headquarters can only get some superficial information of subsidiaries through online meeting, but they cannot gain specific information without meeting employees in person. If executives visit to subsidiaries, they have opportunity to conduct traditional meeting to many workers to gather more details about subsidiaries' condition so that they can expand their control scale of branch companies. 
In conclusion, traditional meeting is irreplaceable for managers to communicate and gain information from employees. Meeting employees in person cannot be replaced by online meeting since managers cannot attain their goal if they only use online meeting. However, only meeting subordinates in person is not an efficient way, companies can combine online meeting and traditional meeting to attain a better stage.

"Families Deserve Paid Paternity Leave
Renee Copp
Belknap
English 105
April 20, 2009
Paid maternity leave has been given to women for several years. Now many people feel as though men should be given the same option as women and be paid to take time off from work following their child's birth. There has been an argument for some time now that these men deserve equal rights as parents. So why shouldn't mothers and fathers have the same rights to their children? Each parent is just as important in their child's life as the other, times have changed and children do not just depend on their mothers anymore. Actions can be taken to help new dads spend more time with their kids.
Paternity leave allows an expectant dad to take time away from work at the time of the birth (or adoption) of his child. In the United States there are currently no laws to help fathers get time off to spend time with their new family. In Sweden parents get 480 fully paid days parental leave. 6 months are reserved for the mother, and 6 for the father, they can be used as and when the parents want until the child's 8th birthday, and in France plus other countries some dads are required to take a certain amount of leave after their child's birth (Rigoli, 2007). This policy in Sweden has a huge impact on some of the most important years in a child's life. Unfortunately as of right now there is only one act in the United States that is in effect to help fathers take leave. Defense Authorization Act helps fathers in uniform obtain some time off to be with their new family. The Defense Department also decided that it would be best to leave it up to each service branch to determine how to handle the new policy. Fathers in uniform can now take time off to be with their newborn. The military branch has chose to give them up to 10 days off for the birth of their child. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Luis Lujan said he's happy with the new policy. ""Every little bit helps. It is kind of cool that the Navy is pursuing this. With both of my kids, my wife had a Caesarean section. It is considered major surgery, so she was not very mobile. It helps that I don't have to dip into my earned leave for the next child."" Even just having 10 days makes a huge difference in the difficult and complicated process of having a child (Abramson).
In the United States parents can technically get 12 weeks unpaid parental leave. Does this really make sense to people? Unless parents have saved a large amount of money there needs to be some sort of income after having a child. Many things need to be purchased for a baby plus both parents need to make sure they are taken care of also. Let me give you an idea of how much an infant can really cost. First you need a cradle, bassinet, or crib for your baby to sleep safely this plus sheets, waterproof mattress pads and two light blankets this will cost about $350. 00 to $400. 00 at a reasonable price. Then a dresser/changing table can cost you about $200.00. Next you need a car seat and stroller and for a good deal you can get those for about $250.00. Now you need the essentials like diapers clothing, formula, bottles, wipes, bathtub, soap, shampoo, well I guess I'll end there you should get the
point by now. An average middle-class family spent about $10,220 on a baby during the first year of life, according to a 2005 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Polder). Now do you still believe that a family can live off no income? After seeing those numbers I do not think a family could comfortably live off even one full salary. Having a new family is such a wonderful and happy part of your life that should not scare anyone into not spending time with their family.
Although money is a leading concern I my biggest worry is when fathers do not have any time away from their job at all. New mothers who have just given birth cannot get any help from their husband or boyfriend if they are at work for 8-10 hours a day. Many mothers like Navy officer Luis Lujan's wife must go under the knife and have a Caesarean section caused by complications. This is a major surgery that can leave the mother in pain and immobile for a few days or even weeks after the birth. How is a mother supposed to take care of a new born child, them self, a husband, household, and any other kids they may have? I interviewed a family friend named Keathanne Wright who had serious complications during her pregnancy that left her bed ridden for a few weeks. Two days after labor her husband had to go back to work and she was left at home with a two day old baby. She was fortunate enough to have family in town that could take time off of their own jobs to care for her and the baby. During the interview she admitted that even though she was extremely grateful for the family that cared for her, she really just
needed her husband by her side and not having him there left her slightly depressed.
This can happen to many new mothers, studies have shown that 50% to
80% of all new mothers experience the baby blues or postpartum blues. This is a mild case of depression that usually occurs 3 to 4 days after giving labor. The baby blues can be caused by physical changes in a women's body, fatigue, or anxiety over baby. This type of depression will usually last up to two weeks or even longer (Epigee). Now imagine yourself in her position, unable to care for herself and her child alone while being depressed and without the one person that she needs. Is this really acceptable?
""Children are more likely to suffer development problems if their fathers do not take paternity leave or spend enough time with them when they are very young, according to an analysis of thousands of babies born around the turn of the millennium (Sacks)."" Later on in the article Sacks states, ""A report published today by the Equal Opportunities Commission and based on research tracking 19,000 children born in 2000 and 2001 found emotional and behavioral problems were more common by the time youngsters reached the age of three if their fathers had not taken time off work when they were born, or had not used flexible working hours to have a more positive role in their upbringing."" Children need their fathers in their lives, from infancy into adulthood. There have been many studies proving that a father's presence in a young child's life has a huge impact for the child's future. Children are like sponges they absorb everything around them whether it's negative or positive. Events and actions that are shown during the child's first few
years can have an enormous impact on the child both emotionally and physically later on in life. As proven from these quotes having both parents in a child's life is
extremely important and can have serious effects in their children's upbringing. Not only do employers and bosses need to realize this but all parents need to know this too.
Earlier this semester I interviewed a new dad asking his views on paternity leave. Working dad Benjamin Wojack said, ""I feel as though it is extremely important to be there during the labor and after the baby is born. No mother should have to do this alone and I would never want to leave my wife's side during this complicated yet amazing time in our lives. I was able to talk to my boss a few months in advance to prepare the company for my absence. Everything worked out nicely and I was able to take four weeks off after my daughter was born and let me tell you, those four weeks were the most changeling and remarkable four weeks of my life."" After talking with Wojack I wondered if I could actually find a father that would opt out of spending time with their newborn and after speaking with 8 fathers each said that they would love to be offered paternity and agreed there should be a law in place making this happen. Now this shows to me that if we were able to not only have a law supporting paternity leave but also a law to insure dads and his family that there was no way he could lose his job then most fathers would absolutely take leave.
While speaking with these fathers I brought up to each one that I feel as though times have evidently changed too rapidly for the U.S., and most seemed to
agree. Parenting has changed in the world and the U.S. needs to catch up. With little public debate, the United States has chosen a radically different approach to
maternity leave than the rest of the developed world (Geissler). Today is 2009 not 1956 it is not just the mothers job to care for the kids anymore, we need to move on. When we see countries with paternity plans like Sweden, France, and Iceland it puts us into shock. In 2004 nearly all-Icelandic fathers used their entitlement to three months off work on 80% of their salary (BBC). How did we get so off track from everyone else? Are Americans really all about money and job stance, is that as deep as we can get? Well yes, dads spend more time with their kids then 50 years ago but not the time that is really necessary. Every little moment counts. Once your child is 14 and you realize you should have been there more when he or she was younger, you will have regrets, and who wants that? Fathers can cook meals do, laundry and change a diapers just as will as any woman so what's stopping our country from letting this happen? Some people are stuck, their feet so far down in the sand that there is only one way, its all the mothers responsibly men just earn the income. This era of stay at home moms and working fathers has been revolutionized. Come on America lets move forward and take the plunge! We need to convince people that men are just as capable as women to care for a family; it is now a team effort.
And last but not least men are idiots for not taking paternity leave. According to Nathan Hegedus a recent and soon to be father of two, ""It's the chance to nap. The chance to ponder NBA playoff match-ups or your favorite baseball team's pitching rotation. The chance to hang out on a bench in the sun with a friend,
but really it's all about naps."" Hegedus spent six months on paternity leave with his daughter last year. And will soon be home with his son for nine or ten months next
year. ""Yes, parental leave is hard, often grindingly hard. It is harder than any job I have ever had. It is likely harder than Barack Obama's job. All the diaper changes, all the food planning and cleaning and crying. You never get a moment to yourself. Your work day lasts all day, yet when I was on leave with my daughter I got a nap almost everyday."" It should not be career killer, it's only a few months then go back to work and begin where you left off. But of course here in America it is. ""Still, dude, it is your own fault you are not trying to change the culture, you are not making noise about your wife getting maternity leave, and you certainly are not fighting for your own time with your kid. It is a cultural paradigm reinforced by jerks."" Says Hegedus.
Man, did he just take the words right out of my mouth, make some commotion about what you want and what your family deserves. If you want it, get it. It's your right to fight to be at home spending time with your child. Oh, and to get a few naps in.
So now is the time where we need to take action. If you are a soon to be father whether your wife is having a baby or you're planning on adopting, speak with your boss a few months in advance. Employers need to be aware that paternity leave is becoming more popular each day. Show them how you feel about spending time with your baby and what you need from them to be able to accomplish this. All you need to do is compromise. It may take some hassling but it is worth it, just ask the fathers that are home now. I'm sure most will agree that it is hard but always
rewarding in the end. Begin with what you think is fair to ask of the company, I would suggest asking for four weeks off 80% salary paid this is a reasonable offer. You could begin the negotiation even stronger ask for four weeks fully paid, you never know what could happen. Offer to work from home so you can still be an asset to the company. Work it out, you and your family will be so grateful in the end.

"Final Draft 
Food in Dining Courts: the Reason of Obesity? 
Nowadays, people are paying more attention to obesity because obesity can lead to many other diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and vascular abnormalities (Baker, 2007, p.2330). One of the important reasons of obesity is the high calorie food. During the time when I was having my meal in the dining courts, I found that some people were apparently suffered from obesity. Then a question came into my mind: is the food in dining courts the main reason of obesity? After doing a series of research, I found that the food offered in the dining courts meets three important aspects: freshness, diversity and nutritional balance. So I hold the view that the food in dining courts is healthy enough for us. 
Healthy diet firstly comes from fresh and clean food ingredients. The dining courts at Purdue do a good job to ensure the reliability of food ingredients. <name> , the supervisor of Ford dining court who has been working there for seven years, told me that the majority of frozen meat, bread and milk come from food stores at Purdue, Piazza Produce and Dean's ( <name> , personal communication, October 15, 2015). In order to keep the food ingredients fresh and clean, all fruit and vegetables are local food. Some of them even come from the student farm at Purdue. <name> , a student in the engineering department who has meals at Ford dining court every day, also agrees that the vegetables are really fresh. He told me that the fresh lettuce is his favorite food in the dining courts even though he is not a vegetarian ( <name> , personal interview, October 14, 2015). 
A healthy diet should contain diverse food. The diversity of food ensure people to be able to intake adequate daily required nutrition. Take the Ford dining court for instance, it offers more than 20 different kinds of food just for dinner and more than 40 kinds of food in total every day. Inside every menu, there are several kinds of meat such as Corn Dogs, Beef Gyros and Catfish Strip, vegetables like Tempura Batter Vegetables and Lettuce Salad, fruits like bananas and apples, and other food like Sausage Pizza and fries (Dining Menus, Nov. 30th, 2015). <name> also told me that ""the menus are different every day and are on a cycle of five weeks"" ( <name> , personal communication, October 15, 2015). 
The diversity does not equal to healthy, but the menus of the dining courts are quite balanced. The menus are designed by certified people. <name> told me that the dining courts hire chefs and system dining court managers to build the menus ( <name> , personal communication, October 15, 2015). They know that people nowadays are more health conscious and they designed healthy menus. For adults, a healthy diet should contain food, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains (WHO, 2015). Vegetables and fruits are adequate. Bananas, apples and oranges are served in the dining courts every day. Lettuce, spinach, carrots and green beans can be found and people can make their own vegetable salad in the dining courts. Rice and bread are also unlimited. In a word, the dining courts serve several kinds of food that are supposed to be in a healthy diet. If you look at the everyday menus, you will discover that these healthy food are the majority. 
However, some people might disagree with my opinion. Indeed, the dining courts also serve fries, pulled pork slider and other fried food. But they are not the main reasons that lead to obesity at Purdue. First, what you choose to eat does matter. The dining courts offer buffet, which means that you have freedom to choose your food. One example is the beverage. According to <name> , even though there are more than ten types of soft beverages being offered in the dining courts, the most popular drink is the water ( <name> , personal communication, October 15, 2015). Students do know that drinking water is much healthier. People should learn how to contain the energy they intake every day. According to the suggestion by World Health Organization (WHO), adults should intake less than 10% of total energy from free sugars and approximately 2000 calories per day (WHO, 2015). The dining courts do a great job in guiding people to eat healthier. All the calories content for food are labeled. Third, unhealthy food is not the only reason of obesity. Western societies display an increased tendency toward sedentary lifestyle (Vilchis-Gil, 2015, p.2). Not taking enough physical activities is also considered to be the reason of obesity (Rivera, 2002, p.121). 
In conclusion, the food offered in dining courts is not the main reason of obesity. The dining courts offer clean, fresh and diverse food, including junk food like hamburgers and fries. But people are not forced to eat them. Opposite, the dining courts show us the information of food and guide us to eat healthier. So it is our own responsibility to choose healthier food to eat.

Extended Argument
The Controversy of Cleopatra VII's Death
Cleopatra is a well-known ancient ruler and pharaoh of Egypt. She was seen both as a goddess as well a human monster. The queen was known for her beauty and deception and was backstabbing towards men. She quite often used her sexuality to her advantage to advance her own success as well as her Egyptian Empire. Cleopatra was both beautiful and smart and is now known as a major component of ancient Egypt today. Her death may always be a mystery because there is no solid evidence to prove either perspective, however, scholars who have researched her death give educated accounts of what happened in 30 B.C. creating a huge controversy today.
Many wonder how Cleopatra VII came into power. Elizabeth Story Donno discusses in her article, Cleopatra Again, how exactly Cleopatra's family came to power. Jones makes it know that Cleopatra was a descendant of Ptolemy I, who was a general of Alexander the Great's army. She was the last pharaoh of the Ptolemaic rulers, ending their reign in 30 B.C. (231-2) Cleopatra and family took on many behaviors of Egyptian pharaohs, including titles and marriage between siblings to ensure royal bloodlines.
Most of Cleopatra's fame today surrounds her downfall and death. Her downfall began with the battle of Actium where Octavian and the Roman Empire began to defeat the Egyptian queen and her husband Mark Antony (181). With the invasion of Octavian and the Roman Empire is what defeated both Cleopatra and Antony. Antony took his own life at the battle in Alexandria. However, Cleopatra's death came about with a bite of an Asp. Today scholars and researchers still debate whether Cleopatra decided to claim her own life, or if someone else should be to blame.
Cleopatra's Death as a Suicide
Prudence J. Jones, in her book entitled Cleopatra: A Source Book paints Cleopatra's death as a tragic love story. After the battle of Actium, Octavian's (Roman) troops moved in to invade Alexandria, Egypt; where both Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony were defeated (see figure 1). Mark Antony attempted suicide under the assumption that his love (and wife), Cleopatra, was already dead when in fact she was not. As soon as Antony learned she was indeed still alive, he ordered his men to take him to her where he died in the queen's arms (181-3). Cleopatra's was left heartbroken and defeated, leaving her with very few options.
Figure 1
Many sources agree that Cleopatra's death was in fact a suicide. The Life and Times of Cleopatra, a book by Arthur Weigall discusses the reasons why the Egyptian queen would want to kill herself. Weigall explains Cleopatra felt there was no reason to go on; she experienced a huge downfall, lost power of her kingdom, was now facing becoming a servant to the new ruler Octavian, and worst of all she lost her husband (415-7). Research shows that many scholars believe Cleopatra VII wanted to die with honor and dignity instead of embarrassment and humility. Weigall believes Cleopatra did end her own life and decided to do so out of desperation to keep honor to her name and out of grief over her husband Mark Antony's death.
So how exactly did Cleopatra the VII die? Michael Grant's book, Cleopatra, verifies that Egypt's queen died from the bite of a poisonous Egyptian snake, known as the Asp. (216) Jones, Weigall, and Grant all paint a similar story about Cleopatra VII. All three sources claim that Cleopatra, after the loss of her kingdom and her husband, had her servants sneak in the Asp in a vase of fruit. She allowed the snake to strike her, spreading poison throughout her bloodstream. Grant explains Cleopatra chose to die of snakebite because that was the least painful form of suicide she could accommodate; also considering appearance, Cleopatra knew this would leave very little destruction to her corpse (218-220). However, scholars question this ancient death still today.
Similar to the belief of how Cleopatra died, Jones, Weigall, and Grant all have doubts about the death. None of the three scholars can one hundred percent confirm that Cleopatra's death was a suicide. Almost all scholars who have researched the death believe Cleopatra took her own life, however; there is a lingering suspicion that the queen could have died at the hand of someone else. Cleopatra by Ernle Bradford explains how no one can know for sure the cause of her death because there is no evidence. Bradford personally believes Cleopatra's death was a suicide, but does not close out the option of murder. (271-5) With desperation setting in, Cleopatra had every motive to take her own life, but despite the motives, murder cannot be completely ruled out. Now comes the question, if Cleopatra VII did not take her own life, then who did?
Cleopatra's Death as a Homicide
Octavian had motive to want Cleopatra dead. Cleopatra Reassessed, edited by Susan Walker and Sally-Ann Ashton explains that Octavian made it known he wanted Cleopatra alive so he could imprison her and make her a slave, it would have caused the most humility to her. (111) However, knowing that Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire once overtook Cleopatra only to have her once again regain power, Octavian had every reason to be anxious and want her dead. The only sure way to make sure Cleopatra VII could never again regain power of her former kingdom.
Although I found no sources that completely support that the pharaoh's death was a murder, I have found sources that really dig deep and question the death as a suicide. The Death of Cleopatra VII, by B. Baldwin really doubts that Cleopatra's motives to kill herself were stronger than Octavian's motives to have her dead (181). Baldwin goes on to say that Octavian wanted to ensure she would never rise to power again, and he knew the only way he could be sure was if she were dead.
Other sources such as Richard C. Harrier in his article, Cleopatra's End, propose the idea that Octavian helped Cleopatra carry out her final wish. Harrier continues to explain that Octavian felt badly after he saw all Cleopatra had gone through and decided to really help her out (63-4). This is a very unique idea because Octavian wanted total destruction for Cleopatra. Harrier brings up the idea that maybe her death ended up being a mercy homicide.
Cleopatra's Tragedy, by L.J Mills disagrees with Harrier. He believes that Cleopatra's death was a suicide, however, he also believes her death was a murder. This might not make sense, but as I learned Mills thinks Cleopatra attempted to kill herself with a different, less poisonous snake, when her suicide attempt failed and Cleopatra was weak and fragile Octavian sent in a snake that would kill her, the Asp.
My Perspective on Cleopatra's Death
After being well informed by many sources about Cleopatra's death, I formed my own perspective on the subject. Although most, if not all scholars believe Cleopatra's death was a suicide with a small suspicion of possibly being a homicide, I personally do not think it was either. The idea that the tragic death was either one or the other was such a simple explanation of what took place centuries and centuries ago.
In my opinion, I strongly believe Cleopatra VII died from a mixture of suicide and homicide. Walker and Ashton made a strong point that Octavian had motives to want the former pharaoh dead. After research, I side with those few scholars who believe Octavian was one who ordered the Asp into Cleopatra's vase of fruit. However, I do not believe that Cleopatra was clueless. I think the queen knew the snake was on the vase and that Octavian now wanted her dead. What would happen next would be in her own hands.
Learning that Octavian wanted her dead, Cleopatra started to have thoughts of dying. I feel that she could have avoided the snake and avoided the poisonous bite; but as she started to think Cleopatra realized how easy things would be if she ended it all. She started to consider her options and realized she truly did want to die. Cleopatra saw it as a win-win situation in my eyes; Octavian would have control of Egypt like he wanted, and she would not have to live a life of a servant and prisoner. With the death of Antony, she felt she had nothing to live for, neither love or power.
I feel Cleopatra viewed this option of death as classy and minimal pain. She would not have to humiliate herself anymore by leaving a gruesome corpse. Personally, it seems that Cleopatra realized Octavian had won. Instead of living a miserable life of shame, she ultimately decided to end it all, and she was able to escape the grief and pain of the loss of Mark Antony. My theory of Cleopatra's death is different and not explained by scholars, but it does make sense because both Cleopatra and Octavian had reasons and motives to want her dead.
Cleopatra's death remains a mystery still today, the ancient 30 B.C. death will always remain controversial due to the lack of evidence. Whether one thinks her death was a suicide, murder, or even something radical such as my perspective, no answer can be proven wrong. Some scholars such as E.E Stoll in his article Cleopatra, have much faith that with modern technology will find a break through and put an end to the mystery (152).
One of the most controversial deaths known to society, Cleopatra will live on and continued to be studied and researched until every option is exhausted. As time goes on, technological advances may prove to have a new break through of what actually happened to Egypt's famous pharaoh. If Cleopatra's death were ever to be completely solved, it would change Egypt forever. Egypt is so mystical and mysterious, if the tragic death of their queen, Cleopatra, were solved, half the mystery of the pyramids and the foundation which Egypt were built upon will be no more.

"Genetics plays the most important role in obesity 
Argumentative essay 
9th April 2015 
Purdue University 
Genetics plays the most important role in obesity 
Obese people are often branded overeaters who don't exercise. <name> on of my interviewees, who just finished his post graduation, said this to me while interviewing him. A person is governed by his or her genetics, some may have very good genes others may not. The others are often subjected to diseases so they should take extra care for themselves. After interviewing <name> and doing research on obesity, I found out that of all the factors that effect obesity, genetics is the most crucial part. For example some people do not gain fat no matter how much they eat, this is because their metabolism is high this is all because of their genes as opposed to people who gain a lot by eating a very little amount. 
	Obesity in most cause is hereditary. But having a defective gene, which causes obesity, is not always bad. According to the article Obesity: Lifestyle or genetics, ""having a tendency to be overweight may well be a sign of superior breeding"". People who have more tendencies to become fat have superior genes than people who do not. ""People who today may become obese were built to survive times of famine, to ensure the survival of the human race. The scrawny ones wouldn't have lived."" It is estimated that people as much as 80 percent have genes which will lead them to obesity. Obesity is often a genetic disorder and is responsible for 50 percent of obesity cases. Exercising and being active is the two most important actions that can lead to a healthy life, however people who have tendencies to become obese wont be able to burn fat so easily, so it is harder for them to see a healthier life-style. For those people who cannot reduce fat by dieting and being active the best bet would be surgery. Though surgery has its own risks it can help reduce 50 percent of their weight and can help them lead a healthy life. 
	""Over the last three decades, the prevalence of overweight and obesity have increased rapidly and the latest World Health Organization (WHO) estimates suggest that 1. 6 billion adults (aged 15 years and over) were overweight and 400 million were obese in 2005""(Fawcett & Barroso, (2006), para.2) and its on the rise. Obesity is a international public threat and economic burden. Having obese relatives increases one's risk for obesity. Obesity is not inherited like other diseases like diabetics or Huntington's but rather involves multiple genes( Lyon & Hirschhorn (2004)). There are multiple different ways to find out the genes involved in obesity such as linkage analysis and association studies. In general obesity is a common disease caused by many factors, with heredity playing a crucial role. Although scientists are not clear as to which single gene disorder causes obesity various animal models suggest a wide variety of possibilities. Certain people cannot reduce weight more than up to a limit this is because they have reached their genetic limitation after which it is almost impossible for them to reduce further. 
	""The first monogenic obesity syndrome to be discovered was the lack of a hormone called leptin which is produced by fat cells and serves as a signal to the brain that there are adequate nutrients around"". People who do not produce leptin due to a genetic defect lack this signal. There brain cannot sense that they have had adequate nutrition, which leads them to constant eating. In short people who lack leptin feel like they are in constant starvation and eat a lot more than they are supposed to. Although the monogenic obesity syndrome has been very informational it only affects a small group of people. There are various other genetic factors that can cause obesity which have not yet been clear yet. 
Conclusion 
	Obesity has been the most common type of malnutrition and one of the greatest with health hazards to life in the World today. Having a better understanding of the genetic contributions to obesity especially common obesity and gene environment interactions will generate a better understanding of the causal pathways that lead to obesity. Obesity is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental causes. The predominant one is genetics, and changes to the environment will be essential if we are to tackle the current epidemic In brief genetics play the most important role in a persons physic along with other factors.

"Some countries allow genetically modified food but others decide to ban it, and it is still one of the most controversial issues that people debate over. GM food is a technology that alters the genes of our food for higher a higher production of food. This technology was introduced about 4 to 5 decades ago into consumer's sights. The hope of this technology is to bring up food production at a stable point so the price of food won't fluctuate. However, many scientists and consumers do not view GM food as an plausible practice due to the possible harm it might cause to our body. In the US, about 80% of the foods we eat today are genetically modified, but the US government is not willing to spend the money to put labels on the GM foods. Consumers do not have a choice, but to risk their own health while consuming GM food. Thus, the US should put labels on food packages that contain GM food materials. 
	Many scientists who support the idea of GM food claim that the food had been tested over and over again before they were released for the consumers. However, this claim was false.(Schubert,2014). Scientists usually take few copies of GM foods and test them over and over again to make sure they are safe. Yet, there is something called mutation. Even though the probability of mutation is very low, when scientists make hundred and thousands of copies from the same copy of genes, mutation will be much more likely to happen. It is impossible and too time consuming for the scientists to test every copies of the GM food and sometimes, this is how mutated food goes into animals and our bodies. ""It is often claimed that ""trillions of GM meals"" have been eaten in the US with no ill effects."" (Hilbeck,2013). However, it was not because GM food really had no effects on human bodies, it was because there are no studies to be done to associate GM food with the health effects of GM food consumption. Why? Because GM foods are not labeled so it is impossible to trace the consumption of GM foods. (Hilbeck,2013). If we really want to know whether GM food cause harm to our bodies, labeling is an inevitable step. 
	Regulations on GM foods are also very limited. Biotech companies that are private do their own safety assessments. FDA, also known as the Food and Drug Administration does not provide any precaution for the possible harm of GM food, nor do they require companies to do safety testing of the GM foods. FDA is suppose to make sure the food we eat and the drug we use are safe for our body to consume. However, simply no regulations are imposed on these suppliers of GM food.(Barlotto,2013) Imagine if you own a company and you try to maximize your profit. Why would the companies bother the time and money to test and regulate themselves if no one is watching over them? Imagine what a ten year old kid would do if his parents are not watching over him, he would do anything he wants, and probably all the things that his parents do not allow him to do. This creates tremendous harm to the consumer sides. Since there are no reports directly point out diseases that are caused by GM food, biotech companies can usually get away with the reduced testing and reduced regulation. If no one is watching over these private companies that try to maximize their profits, labeling will allow consumers to watch over themselves. 	 
	What do the consumers really want? ""Consumers cannot distinguish the risks and benefits of the technology itself"" (Bredahl, 2001). Consumers with little awareness on this topic usually have negative attitude towards GM food. However, the further they know more about this topic, they still do not gain positive attitudes, instead, they gain stronger negative attitudes. Since people have negative attitudes, many Americans support labeling of GM food, ""according to a New York Times poll conducted this year, with 93 percent of respondents saying that foods containing such ingredients should be identified.""(Kopicki,2013). Despite the strong support for labeling, but why cant labeling laws get passed? Companies such as Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer, Bayer Crop Science, Dow Agrosciences, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association spend over 25 million dollars to prevent labeling of GM foods. This makes consumers wonder, what is there to hide behind GM foods? 
	About 80% of the foods in the US are genetically modified. However not enough tests and regulations were done to prevent possible harm from the consumers, and consumers have no transparency on what they actually eat. It is consumers' right to choose what they actually eat, especially if the food could harm our body. No matter how much money those biotech companies spend every year to stop the labeling, they still cant deny the fact the labeling is needed in the near future, for the consumers and data analysis on the possible harm of GM food.

Is it valuable and necessary to get aero equipment 
As the development of technology and science, wind tunnel first comes out to testing cars, but now, it also can be used to test road bikes, figure out how much wind force bikes should deal with during riding. With wind tunnel technology, a new kind of road bikes is born-aero road bikes. They called aero because they are much more aerodynamic than the normal bikes. They are stepping up on the stage of Tour France and TT (triathlon). At the same time, there comes the debates, is it valuable to get aero and is it necessary? Many people agree while others do not. Personally speaking, also as a cyclist, there are much more advantages for getting aero mainly because they can make bike faster and stronger, also save energy for riders, and I'll explain all of it to make them convinced. 
Aero on bikes 
Aero technology affect road bikes a lot mainly from aero equipment upgrade. Cyclists usually displace old parts from their bikes with aerodynamic equipment such as aero bars, aero wheels, aero frames and so on. 
As my first point of view, aero makes bikes faster. It is obvious for people to know the less wind force a thing against, the less air drag force it will get. With the help of wind tunnel, aero equipment is made in smooth shapes with cutting edge which make it sharp, the same origin as a car with a spoiler. From the front view, the bike just looks as thin as a string. As a result, it reduces the surface area contact against wind. And here is an example from Specialized.com. It is an experiment that they built an aero bike using wind tunnel supported by Mc Laren. In the same condition with same wind speed, same rider and same riding speed, it turned out that the bike became the fastest bike they had ever made just because it had new design and equipment which made it getting more aero. 
Next, aero also makes bikes stronger, because when cyclist rides fast, wind speed will increase as the riding speed increases. In order to protect the frames and cyclists, bikes should be made stronger. And what is amazing is, carbon fiber can make bikes aero. Also it is strong enough to hold against huge wind. So that is the reason why many bikes are made of carbon. A research provided by Bike Rader is aim to find out the limit of shape changing on different materials under ultimate condition. The result shows that, frames which made of steel change shapes first which means steel is weakest, and then comes to the aluminum. At last, carbon frames become the strongest one. 
From I shown above, it is easy to understand that aero can make bikes stronger and faster. 
Aero on cyclists 
Aero technology not only can be used on objects, but also on people. 
Firstly, aero makes cyclist pedaling efficiently. With the aero pedals, cyclists can use less energy to move the bike forward because aero pedal lock their feet so there is no useless energy used during pedaling. Take my experience as an example. On the first ride, I was riding to climb, it was tough to pedal the bike because I felt that basic pedals cannot absorb all of the energy to make bike forward. A week later, I took a climb using aero pedals, and nothing seemed tough for me as the first ride. It felt like when I pedaled, the bike just responded quickly without any hesitation. As the words said in the website Bike Rader, aero makes cyclists easier to ride. What is more, the author of the article published in BR, Jeff, provides a more efficient skill for cyclists which is using drag to get more aero. He says that this allows cyclists to ride in straight line, the leader gets the most wind force while other behind him will get drags, with the help of aero equipment, they will be riding much easier and more smoothly. 
Secondly, aero clothing and helmets make cyclist feel comfortable and relax when riding against the wind. Aero clothing is made to be smoothly enough for wind to pass by and aero helmet not only give cyclist good protection, it also reduces drag because it has things like spoiler that can direct the wind pass through human body easily. Ben Hady, school cycling club leader, actually done an experiment few days before. He took two rides with the same route and the similar air condition, the only difference is he wear aerodynamic clothing and equipment for the second ride, but in the first, he hadn't. By comparing the time using, 2h34min and 2h13min, it is obviously to see how fast he rides with aero. But what is more, Hady said that he felt different after the ride. For the first ride, the whole bottle of water is gone, but there is half left for the second ride. Hady indicates that it is really easy to ride with aero and he feels relax because it helps cyclists against wind, it makes air smoothly passed by. Another example comes out from famous rider, Lance Edward Armstrong, also the test rider of a famous bike brand, Treck. When its first aero bike came out, Lance was the first man who ride it and he said that: this is the most wonderful and fastest bike I have ever ridden. You can reach your top speed with easy. 
However, there is a big disadvantage that can make people get away from aero equipment and that is the price. The price is always high with the rare technology of wind tunnel testing and fashion, usually they are over 500 dollars for basic clothing and over 1000 for frames or wheels or so on. So some experts state that people with little skills on cycling is not so necessary to have them. Also, people think that there is little chance for them to ride in big team and with skillful teammates, and they indicate that there is no need to take aero equipment with them to work or go shopping. But still, I think aero equipment worth that money, just because they provide cyclists with so much convenience and I can fully use them efficiently. 
So here comes the conclusion, since then, I still strongly insist that aero equipment is so valuable just because it saves energy for riders and speeds up bikes, it makes riders feel relax and efficiently when ride bikes on hard. Because if riders ride bikes for a long period they may feel uncomfortable with their bike such as having no power to pedal and feeling bad with sitting on the seat or bend their knees for too long. And with the help of changing to aero equipment, cyclists will no longer feel that uncomfortable and just like I said before, they can save a lot of energy and prevent their knees to be so hard. And they are necessary for cyclists to experience the extreme speed and also necessary for cyclists who truly love racing and would like to improve their skills just because aero equipment not only protect yourself from strengthen the bike, but also give a lot of advantages for riders.

"Should People Trust Nuclear Energy 
Purdue University 
Should People Trust Nuclear Energy 
	In the twenty first century, the shortage of fossil fuel energy is becoming more and more serious and clear. People and scientists are seeking new energy resources to ensure people can continue living on this planet with sufficient energy. Nuclear energy is one of the most common and practical new energy that can produce enough electricity with reasonable occupation of land. But the past accident that happened in Chernobyl, Ukraine, Three Mile Island, and the most recent accident that happened in Fukushima made people wonder if they should trust nuclear energy; this have became one of the most controversial topics. People seem to be afraid of nuclear energy by the impacts of those three accidents. It is important to discuss if people should continue trusting nuclear energy, because we need sufficient amount of energy urgently, safely, and neatly. Based on my research, information support that the past accidents of nuclear energy were mainly caused by avoidable human mistakes from either operators' sides or designers' sides; moreover, the safety records could show that those issues could be minimized by more comprehensive training and better devices. 
	Due to the serious consequences of three recent nuclear energy accidents-the Chernobyl Nuclear accident in Ukraine, Three Mile Island nuclear Accident in US, and Fukushima Nuclear Accident in Japan, a lot people lost trust in the nuclear energy. 
	The earliest nuclear accident was at Three Mile in 1979, United States. This accident was caused by avoidable design defects and uncomprehensive training, and finally caused reactor melt down. According to WNA (2012) that ""The operators were unable to diagnose or respond properly to the unplanned automatic shutdown of the reactor. Deficient control room instrumentation and inadequate emergency response training proved to be root causes of the accident (Three Mile Island Accident, 2012)"" Based on WNA's report (2012) the accident was caused by the avoidable design failure that could not provide enough information to the controller, which was the inaccurate indication of the reactor's valve, and also the controllers' uncomprehensive training (Three Mile Island Accident, 2012). Therefore, the accident in the Tree Mile Island was caused by avoidable human mistakes, the accident could be circumvent without the designers' mistakes and the controllers' misunderstanding. WNA (2012) suggests that there were no injuries or death resulted in this accident, but people began to feel 'uncomfortable' with nuclear energy (Three Mile Island Accident, 2012). According to the United States Nuclear Commission (2013), the accident of Three Miles Nuclear Power plant affected the whole industry of nuclear energy, because people were scared and became not to trust nuclear energy. (Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island Accident, 2013) In order to ensure the safety and regain the trust from people, the United States Nuclear Commission issued numerous changes to ensure the safety of nuclear energy. According to United States Nuclear Commission (2013), the major changes were improving the design and equipment standard to ensure the isolations, clarifying the human responsibilities by strengthening training, improving the emergency preparations, and strengthening the regulations. (Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island Accident, 2013) 
	Chernobyl Nuclear accident, which happened in the year of 1986 at Chernobyl, Ukraine. Chernobyl accident had the most serious consequences ever, and gave people more fear over nuclear energy. The WNA (2015) suggests that this accident causes about 5% of radioactive reactor core, which is about 5200 PBq divulge into the air (Chernobyl Accident 1986, 2015). The WHO (2005) report shows that ""A total of up to 4000 people could eventually die of radiation exposure from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP) accident nearly 20 years ago, an international team of more than 100 scientists has concluded (Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident, 2015)"". The information of those two reports give us a view of how serious the consequences are. But the accident itself was not totally due to the nuclear reactor itself, the major trigger was human mistakes as well. The WNA (2015) report that the accident was triggered by two stuff that were not well-trained operate the reactor with defect that was not mentioned in operation procedures (Chernobyl Accident 1986, 2015). WNA also suggests that although the responsibility of decreasing the reactor's operating reactivity margin should be taken by the operators, but the designers should have considered the defect of reactors and emphasized the safety instruction in the procedures (Chernobyl Accident 1986, 2015). Those information all suggest that the accident was caused by avoidable human mistake; either from the operators' sides, or designers, sides. Due to the huge consequences that the accident caused, more people joined in to question if nuclear energy should be trusted. 
	 The Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan is the most recent nuclear accident in 2011. The WNA (2015) intestates that although the accident seems to be triggered by unavoidable natural disaster tsunami that disables the electricity of cooling system, but the serious consequences are actually caused by human error as well (Fukushima Accident, 2015). According to WNA (2015), the stuffs of the nuclear reactor operated a restimation of the sustainability of the nuclear reactor, which received a value higher than the designed value. Some reinforces were made to the nuclear reactor, but they were tested to be insufficient in the accident (Fukushima Accident, 2015). The more serious defect is that the regulation branch was not function individually with justice; the investigation finally discovered the omission of the regulation branch. From the report of WNA (2015), the nuclear reactor noticed that there are potential dangers might cause the electricity disable, however, the regulation branch did not supervise any reinforcements of the nuclear reactor; the regulation branch even told the operators that there is no need to reinforce it. The disabilities are caused by the lack of emergency operation experiences and an incomplete manual. Also, the culture of Japan made them not willing to question authorities and powerful side, and obey the authorities with no principles make the regulation become a difficulty (Fukushima Accident, 2015). Therefore, Fukushima accident was also caused majorly by human mistake like those to accidents introduced before, but the Fukushima accident was unique, because it's also related to culture difference. 
	Basing on the information that provide by authoritative organizations, it's clear that the three most serious were all caused by avoidable human mistakes whether in the end of designers or the end of operators; it's not because the nuclear energy itself has. 
	Prof. <name> who is an assistant professor at the <name> Department of Purdue University pointed out that people tend to be afraid of things that they don't understand, and nuclear energy is just one of those things problems. Due to this reason, media also tend to make nuclear energy looks dangerous either because they don't understand this field or because they have to make news looks serious so that more people would watch their program; as a result, fear would be separate around people and make people feel afraid (Personal interview, Nov 2, 2015). 
	However, the truth is that nuclear energy had a good record throughout the safety records of nuclear energy. WNA (2015) suggest that the three accidents mentioned before were the only three accident, Chernobyl accident was the only one caused serious consequences (Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors, 2015). Moreover, according to WNA (2015), ""16,000 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear power operation in 33 countries"" (Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors, 2015). Although the impacts of disasters could be tremendous, but people should not lose trust on nuclear energy due to three accidents within 16,000 cumulative reactor-years. 
	Also, engineers are always improving the system. According to WNA (2015), the western nuclear power plants are all installed with containments, which are like containers that isolates the reactors with outside to prevent any leak. As an improvement of safety, those Russian made reactors are all closed to ensure the safety. (Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors) Therefore, people could prevent nuclear energy enter an unsafe, and incontrollable situation. World Nuclear Association (2015) suggests that in order to achieve the convenient of cooling, the designer would chose locations nearby the cost, thus, tsunami or flooding could be threats to the safety; although the natural disaster could be a trigger of nuclear accident like Fukushima nuclear accident, but engineers make improvements on the structure to prevent an accident like nuclear accident. For example, some French reactors are close to the sea, engineers build sea walls to prevent flooding and tsunami; although Fukushima accident was caused by tsunami, but Fukushima's sea wall could be useful if they would have the regulations like today (Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors, 2015). Therefore, the risks could be controlled with will managed and rigorous operations. People should trust nuclear engineers' technologies, which they have ensured 16,000 reactor-yeas operations. 
	Moreover, people should not just reject nuclear energy because nuclear energy is the most practical high efficiency clean energy over others; reject nuclear energy would cause energy shortage and economic issues. According to the WNA, after the Fukushima nuclear accident, the result of the polling about the public opinions of nuclear energy shows that about 90% of people oppose the development of nuclear energy; therefore, German is shutting down nuclear power plants due to the wide protest on nuclear power; the half of the electricity in German is now powered by fossil fuel (Nuclear Power in Germany, 2015). WNA suggest that the cost for German to replace nuclear energy by other new energy would be extremely high about 1000 billion, moreover, the new energy that is planning to be replaced would not be as efficient as nuclear energy (Nuclear Power in Germany, 2015). Prof. <name> suggests that ""German had to import electricity from other countries to ensure the electricity usage; ironically, the electricity they imported was generated by nuclear energy"" (Personal interview, Nov 2, 2015). Therefore, people should not reject nuclear energy just because the fear of not understanding nuclear energy. 
	Based on the research, the risk of having accident could be minimized. As the world is having more and more environmental issues, reject nuclear energy would not help the world to recover its environment since there isn't any new energy as reliable as, and as practical as nuclear energy. Although Prof. <name> said that engineers could not eliminate the risk since there would be situations that system could not deal with, human must be operating the system no matter how well the system is designed; however, comprehensive training and well-designed system could minimize the risk. The media should do their research before reporting professional topic like nuclear energy, since nowadays people are usually getting information by media; report with misunderstanding or selling strategy would only make people to have more fear over something they should trust. People who are not trusting nuclear energy could also find out some knowledge from academic paper and try to understand this technology, except those people who are pretending to sleep. In conclusion, people should trust nuclear energy as it has a good safety record within long term with minimized risk by modern technologies.

Future shopping will be online 
Online shopping is playing a more and more important role in people's daily lives. With the development of online shopping, logistics industry has boosted a lot. The whole process of online shopping needs the cooperation of these two industries. Online shopping not only boosts the logistics industry, but also provides many benefits for people. From my perspective, companies should not build or rent retail stores. It is better for them to improve their online shopping services, and make online shopping replace real malls. 
Another reason is that air pollution in shopping malls is quite severe. According to an essay I found on the Internet, the air pollution in the shopping malls, which open for nine hours, is more serious and is more harmful to human body. For example, some shopping malls want to attract more costumers, so they have some restaurants in the malls. These restaurants create cooking fume, which can result in insomnia, hypomnesis and so on. Formaldehyde is also a big problem for malls, which open upon completion of decoration. I also notice that, during weekdays, there are not many costumers in the malls. So if the malls open all the time, it will cause waste of resources. However, if people shop online, these problems do not exist any more. 
The last reason of improving online shopping service is its advantage. Online shopping can stimulate the countries' economic development, especially the logistics industry. Firstly, according to a survey, the total transaction fund in China on 11th November was 5. 75 billion in 2013, but in 2014, it was about 57. 1 billion. These figures clearly show that online shopping enlarged the volume of logistics industry. Furthermore, online shopping provides people with different diplomas. In this modern city, the competition for graduated students is very severe. Many of them are unemployed, even if they have a very high education level. However, everyone can be an online shop owner with or without a diploma. Only the quality of goods and services provided by online shop owners are concerns of online shoppers. Also, as stated before, with the expansion of logistics industry, the employment has raised a lot. Furthermore, Online shopping makes it easier and more convenient for online shoppers to purchase all kinds of things around the world. By clicking keyboards at home, shoppers can get commodities within few days via delivery companies. According to Mr. <name> chief executive officer of an online shopping website, online shopping websites always provide reviews from former purchasers, so the shoppers can compare the qualities of goods. Mr. <name> also mentioned that coupons are given to the old costumers. So the more customers buy on the same website, the more they will save. 
Some people believe that online shopping cannot replace real malls, because they think they may get fake goods. I used to worried about this, however, the policies of the online shopping websites make me completely trust the quality of their goods. For example, Amazon provides free return and free shipping to costumers. If costumers receive goods that they do not like, they can return it without any extra fees. Also, all online shop owners must provide their own ID cards and identities to have their shops- they are bounded by laws. Some people also say that in poor areas the economies are not so developed that people there do not have access to the Internet. However, society and technology are changing, network coverage areas are becoming larger. So, I believe in the near future, the economies in the poor areas will be much more developed than today, and people there will all be able to shop online. 
Online shopping has more advantages than shopping malls, thus it is better for merchants to enhance their online shopping services. The land used for shopping malls now will be used for the infrastructure constructions, and the air pollution issue in malls will not affect people's health anymore. I believe that online shopping will finally take the place of real shopping malls. Although there are defects of my opinions, I think the advantages of online shopping will overshadow the disadvantages, and online shopping will be the mainstream trend.

Argumentative Essay 
Draft #2 
Education System 
With the dramatic changes over the few decades, overall world's culture seems to put more and more emphasis on the education system. People started to acknowledge the discrepancies between the different countries' education systems and started to rank the education system. Apparently, one study says that South Korea has always been ranked high in this, but the United States has been ranked average while the other study claims that the United States education is further improved than South Korean education. This essay will look at both sides of the argument. Then, it will explain how the United States education system is better than South Korean education in terms of efficiency because of the freedom of using the spare time, the variety fields of study that students can pick from, and the qualified education students can get from the United States colleges. 
The first aspect to point out is that the United States students have more freedom to use their spare time than the South Korean students. This simply means that the students in the United States is more freely involved in the extra activities, such as sports, music, and volunteer works. For example, a lot of students in the United States like to play variety of sports. On the other hand, the Korean students hardly spend any time in those activities. <position> <name>, with whom I interviewed, would agree with this statement. <name> said that, ""In the past, Korean students were barely involved into any activities. The students back then thought that the extra activities were unnecessary."" He experienced both of the Korean and US education. Therefore, he fully understands the differences between two education systems. He thinks that this is the reason why the Korean students used to have less freedom to use their spare time than the American students. 
On the other hand, some might argue that the Korean education system is more effective than the United States education based on the world education system rankings. Nonetheless, this is not necessarily true. Although the scores of the South Korean students may be higher than the scores of the United States students, a lot of students in Korea lack in their creativities. For example, according to my interviewee, <position> <name>, there is a main shortcoming in the South Korean education system. He said that the main shortcoming is the style of teaching by rote. Teaching by rote is not an effective way of studying because the students with this kind of style may do well on the test, but it is easy for them to forget the context after a while. On the other hand, the students who actually think through the context and study it will have a long-term memory. Therefore, the Unites States education style is much more effective than the South Korean education style. 
The last aspect to point out is that the United States students are almost guaranteed to achieve a qualified education from the colleges. The United States colleges have a high quality of education. As mentioned above in this essay, the United States has far more world class university programs than South Korea. For example, in the article, ""An American Imperative: Public Education,"" Resnick stated that the American education is well adapted to the changing world. It is one of the most important things that even the education system is changing along the culture. If either one cannot keep up with the other one, the discrepancy can be made and eventually the education system will be in no more use. Therefore, because the United States education is keeping up with the culture, the United States students are guaranteed to receive a qualified education from the colleges. 
From these three arguments, one could conclude that the United State education system is better than South Korean education in terms of efficiency because of the freedom of using the spare time, the variety fields of study that students can pick from, and the qualified education students can get from the United States colleges. Nevertheless, while talking about the education system, it is kind of pointless to say that one is better than the other because one can adapt the better aspect from the other one and it will even make a better combination of two.

"Should Alcohol be Legal in Saudi Arabia?
Saudi Arabia is one of the most important countries in the world. Saudi Arabia reached that position among countries for many reasons, such as oil, but they did not start work on domestic issues until King Abdullah became king in 2005. King Abdullah has made a lot of changes in Saudi Arabia rules. King Abdullah is trying to improve the country and make people live better than ever. However, alcohol is a subject that King Abdullah has never discussed or even given the chance for anyone to study the idea of legalizing. Legalizing alcohol is a subject of argument in Saudi Arabia. These sides are social, health, and culture.
Some people in Saudi Arabia believe that the Saudi government should legalize alcohol. These people want to legalize alcohol because they are drinker and they do not want to travel if they want to drink. Also, international companies want to legalize alcohol to get some for their foreign workers. Alcohol should stay illegal in Saudi Arabia because the Quran strongly shows how alcohol should be illegal.
People in general want to feel freedom and not see themselves as slaves. Nobody can meet all people's needs because people will never have just one opinion. Alcohol is one of the things that people have different opinions about. Some people think that Alcohol should not be legal in Saudi Arabia for many reasons. A confidential source, who will be called M.A., lives in Saudi Arabia as a citizen and works in King Fahad University as Professor. He does not want to allow alcohol in Saudi Arabia. According to M.A., ""Alcohol can have many negative affects in the Saudi Arabia culture and give the possibility for crime to increase"" (personal interview). M.A. Many people in Saudi Arabia agree with M.A. because they want to keep the society relatively crime free.
On the other hand, some people think that the effects of alcohol depend on the person so not everyone who drink alcohol will become a criminal. People who support legalizing alcohol say, since there are drinkers in Saudi Arabia, why does not the government allow it, because it is a personal issue. Even people cannot drink in Saudi Arabia legally they will drink outside Saudi Arabia. According to Alarabiya news channel, ""Manama is the place to be for Saudis seeking to escape what is seen as the rigid laws of their country. The Bahraini capital offers a gamut of debaucheries from drinking and clubbing to prostitution, an illegal yet widely available industry"" (Bahrain makes the, 2009). These people think they should be able to drink legally inside their own country instead of being criminals by Saudi Law.
The government has legalized alcohol for people who work for Saudi Aramco, which is a major source of revenue in Saudi Arabia. Within Saudi Aramco compounds people are allowed to buy and drink alcohol. A confidential source, who will be called T.A., is a Saudi citizen who worked for Saudi Aramco for fifteen years. T.A. said, ""The Saudi Arabia government has allowed alcohol for Saudi Aramco because Saudi Aramco is the main oil company in Saudi Arabia and they use a lot of foreign workers to get the oil"" (Personal Interview).
Saudi Aramco is the reason that most international companies want to legalize alcohol for their workers. The government has to be equal to all companies because that will make investors invest their money in Saudi Arabia. Legalizing alcohol can help Saudi Arabia to make many international companies work for the Saudi economy, which will help Saudi Arabia in many ways.
Alcohol can make many health side effects on human body. Most alcohol side effects appear in the long term and that is the reason most people do not care about these side effects. Alcohol can make brain damage, breathing may stop, heart disease, liver failure, intestinal cancer and many other side effects. Most people want to live more, but they do not work on that. People who want to live more have to care about their body system. Everyone body system have limit that cannot be cross. These side effects can kill the drinker, which will not only affect on the drinker is also will affect on the drinker's family.
Family is one of the most important things that alcohol can have side effect on. Alcohol can take over any family and destroy it. Alcohol can affect on the children in the drinker family. According to Bill Urell, that 28.6% of the children in the United States are affected by alcohol via member of the family. . According to Bill Urell, alcohol can make seven common problems for families. These problems are violence, marital conflict, infidelity, jealousy, economic insecurity, divorce, and fetal alcohol effect. These problems happened in the United States and they did many studies and research to solve these problem but they still having these problem. Saudi Arabia has to see the United States as an example and see the problems that alcohol would make in families.
Alcohol can affect on people and make them drive while they are drunk and that can make them killed. The United States has stated that that there is many car accidents happened in the US because the drivers are drunk.
Alcohols have many side affect on the Saudi traditional. One of these side affects is that alcohol can make some people irresponsible about their decisions. People in Saudi Arabia really consider any word they say and alcohol can affect that. Also, alcohol can affect on relationship because drinking alcohol is unacceptable in the Saudi society. Alcohol is not acceptable in the Saudi society because religion does not accept it.
Religion is what Saudi Arabia has been used to make laws. The Quran is the source for the Saudi constitution. Saudi Arabia is the only country that makes their constitution based on the Quran and that is one of the reasons make Saudi Arabia the most religious country for Muslims. The second reason is that Saudi Arabia has the most two holy places in their land, which most Muslims want to visit these places. The Quran has shown clearly that Muslims are not allowed to drink, sell or even have alcohol for their guests. It is written in the Quran:
""O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed. (90) Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink and games of chance, and to turn you from remembrance of Allah and from (His) worship. Will ye then have done? (91) Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and beware! But if ye turn away, then know that the duty of Our messenger is only plain conveyance (of the message) (92).""
Muslims have to obey what Quran tells them to do or not to do. That is why the Quran is one of the reasons Saudi Arabia does not allow alcohol. Saudi Arabia feels it is the only country that can protect Islam and Muslims. All Muslims around the world must come to Saudi Arabia at least once for Hajj. Saudi Arabia is an example for Muslim world. For that reason, King Abdullah will not even give people the chance to discuss legalizing alcohol.
In conclusion, the Saudi government has done a lot of work to make Saudi Arabia what is it now, a safe country with a strong Islamic culture. . Some people believe they should have the freedom to drink in Saudi Arabia but other believe it is against the Quran . The government have their reasons to make alcohol illegal, but modern life and the needs of international companies are things that the government has to consider. Alcohol should still be illegal in Saudi Arabia because legalizing alcohol could cause many bad effects and change the culture of Saudi Arabia.

"Some Rules of Exercise Must Be Followed 
	These years, more and more people start to work out in order to obtain more physically attractive bodies and healthier lifestyles. I am also a big fan of exercising. I have been working out for 2 years, and I really enjoy it. Every time I see myself in the mirror, I feel really pleasant because I can clearly recognize the result of my effort. However, happiness is not the only thing work out gives me. There is also some knowledge I attained when I try to explore the most appropriate ways to work out.	There are always arguments about if there are some specific ways or rules to follow. Some people think there are no specific rules to follow when working out, because everybody has different habit; whatever fits them the most is the best. I believe that although people are admittedly different, there are a series of basic rules everybody has to keep in mind. Although people has different habit, their body structures are similar. For that reason, there must be some specific rules of exercise that fit everybody. 
	First of all, since people have similar body structures, the way bodies react to food intake should be similar too. According to a study by Meyer, Manore and Beming (2012), food intake is the only way people can restore energy loss during working out, and there are specific rules to follow when one choose food after exercising. There are three things need to be paid attention to - protein, carbohydrates and water. Protein is a basic ingredient of muscle. After working out, muscles have done plenty of work and lost some energy. It makes the muscles have the trend to grow. Only with enough protein intake, the muscles could grow in a decent condition. Thus, protein intake is significant for those who wants to build muscles. Good protein sources are chicken, beef, fish, egg whites and protein powder (Aceto, 2005). Carbohydrates, normally called sugar, together with water assists metabolism, which is a body function that consumes body fat (Meyer, Manore and Beming, 2012). Aceto (2005) states that fruits, vegetables, oatmeal, potatoes, rice and pasta are decent choices for carbohydrate intake. In order to build a more physically attractive body, one needs to ingest adequate protein to build muscle and proper amount of carbohydrate as well as water to consume body fat. Therefore, due to the similarity of how protein, carbohydrate and water affects bodybuilding, I believe there are some specific rules must be followed when choosing food. 
Second, efficiency is one of the most important thing when working out. In the interview I conducted with a professional fitness trainer named Gefeng, he claimed that choosing a proper location to work out is essential because it affects the efficiency. For example, going to a gym provides higher efficiency than at home, because first of all the big equipment in the gym helps people to work out more effectively. Also, the guidance and protection from fitness trainers helps to improve efficiency too (personal communication, October 16, 2014). In a following interview, Gefeng stated that place is not the only thing that affects exercise efficiency. Exercise activities, length of working out period and frequency also play important roles in efficiency. How those things affects efficiency does not really differ between different people, because people's bodies have very similar reaction to how they exercise (personal communication, December 10, 2014). Thus, I have reasons to believe that there are some rules need to be remembered considering the efficiency. 
		Another aspect needs consideration is injury prevention. Injury is the last thing one would want when doing sports, because it hurts and slows one's speed of achieving his/her fitness goal by keeping him/her away from the gym for a while. According to article What Are Sports Injuries (2009), accidents, poor training practices, improper gear, improper body condition and lack of preparation activities can all possibly lead to sports injury. People could get injured due to similar reasons, because their body structures are similar. Hence, no matter how different people are from each other, I believe there are rules to keep in mind in order to prevent injury. Article 10 Tips to Prevent Injuries When You Exercise (2013) claimed that there are some tips one should remember when exercising. And the tips provided in it are all focused on the same cause of injury that was described in article What Are Sports Injuries (2009). Based on these two articles, I believe exercise injuries are all caused by similar reasons, and there are some specific things people can do to avoid getting injured. 
	All the information above showed that when working out, there are some particular rules to keep in mind considering things like food choice, location, injury prevention and so on. For each aspect, people should do sufficient study in order to obtain enough knowledge. Only if people discover proper rules of exercising and follow them properly, they can work out effectively and safely.

"Beyond as a Biology Graduate
	What is the most important factor pursuing a career in biology? Many biology students want to know the important factors that would guide them to work toward a certain career such as research technician or biology professor. In order for students to pursue a career in biology such as biology research technician or biology technician, it is most important for students to have interest and passion about biology careers and want to learn more about the career they choose to pursue.
	One of the reasons why the student's interests toward certain biology career is most important is that student's interest allows student to be more engaged in studying and specializing into a career of interest. For example, a student who has interest in biology and teaching will focus on field of education in biology; student who love to do research and spending time in labs will become a research technician. Dr. Kathleen Eyster from Basic Biomedical Sciences, University of South Dakota, recommended that students should assess their personal interests in terms of choosing a career in biology fields (327). Without an interest, student will not be engaged in learning to get the knowledge for the future career. Hence it is important for student to first find career of interest and with that interest get a hold of courses that help student to get to that specific career. Student with interest in specific field will help him or her to focus more and try hard to achieve student's goal in that specific career field.
Another reason why student's interest is most important factor in choosing a career is that student will have to stick with the chosen career for quite a long time to become an expert in that field. Biology professor Dr. <name> <name> <name> from Purdue University studied his field of biology for long time since as a university student. Dr. <name> said, ""I like biology and working with students in the university."" It was possible for him because he had great effort and interest toward his field of biology and teaching. Majority of the careers requires a person to invest years of experience in that field in order to become a professional. If the person lacks interest in what he or she is doing, it will be difficult for him or her to stay on focus in learning. Consequently that person will be unable to spend time effectively seeking for knowledge on his or her career field. In addition if the person does not study more into a field then he or she will stay in the same place for years without advancement to higher position in career field. Therefore it is important for students to find biology career that most interest them and be prepared to spend long time in that field to become an expert.
Even though student's interest is one of the factors in pursuing a career in biology, a mere interest of individual is not the most important factor among other significant factors such as skills and education. According to Dr. Eyster it is vital for student to have specific skills such as critical thinking skill and persistence in career (323). Dr. <name> further noted organization, managing time, and getting along with people will help in biology career as well. Normally it takes four to six years to advance from BS to Ph.D.; and education during these years in university will build on and help student to have solid knowledge to be successful in career. However student without a strong interest in specific biology career will not study and practice skills necessary in chosen career field. Student selecting a career of interest allows student to plan out an efficient study plan to pursue a specific career. In reality student invests money and time to study and learn the skills required in specific career. By constructing an efficient study plan such as taking specific courses in the university will both save some money and time for the students. In order to make an effective study plan, student individually needs to do a research about the career in detail and sort out courses and skills required in the field. Therefore by choosing a career of interest students can efficiently plan out their study plans and take effective courses to pursue specific biology careers.
Interest in career motivates students to learn more and eventually specialize into specific biology career. Among factors that help students to pursue a career in biology, the most important factor is that students need to have an interest toward a specific career. Factors such as skill and education are essential as well, but without an interest students' motivation for studying for certain career would drop fast. It's recommended for students to think and research about careers that are interesting to them the most. At that point students then could focus in studying and preparing the path for that career. The interest that students have toward certain biology careers will help student to construct efficient study plan, engage learning about courses related to the career, and spend long time in that career to become an expert.

The Production and using of Nitrogen Fixation Fertilizer: Biological or Industrial
	For thousands years, human have known how to utilize fertilizer for high yield of agricultural production. Babylonians, Egyptians, Early Germans and Romans are all recorded as using minerals and manures to enhance the productivity of their farms. Today, the most efficient and widely-used kind of fertilizer is nitrogen fixation fertilizer. It is extremely important for today's global agriculture industry. From ""Nitrogen Fixation"" written by Richard Robinson, published on Encyclopedia.com in 2002, we can see that the modern agriculture systems depend on nitrogen fixation by alfalfa, clover, and most importantly, nitrogen fixation fertilizers. There are two kinds of nitrogen fixation fertilizer, which are biological nitrogen fixation fertilizer (""BNFF"" for short) and industrial nitrogen fixation fertilizer (""INFF"" for short). A lot of controversies has been going on about the topic of which is the better nitrogen fixation fertilizer to be produced and used on farmland. Industrial or biological? My statement is that both these two kinds of nitrogen fixation fertilizer are important and necessary for agricultural production. In this argumentative paper, I want to talk about my understanding of nitrogen fixation fertilizer.
BNFF is naturally produced by nitrogen fixation. The process of nitrogen fixation is a part of nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen cycle is a process that is carried out through both biological and physical processes. In the article ""The Nitrogen Cycle: of Microbes and Men"" by John Arthur Harrison (2003), in nitrogen fixation, the author showed that nitrogen uptakes through organismal growth. In nitrogen cycle, the nitrogen in atmosphere cannot be used directly, the nitrogen in atmosphere can only be absorbed and utilized by plants after being processed through nitrogen fixation. In this nitrogen cycle, after the animals eat the plants, a part of the protein is broken down by animals' digestive system, and nitrogenous wastes like carbamide are produced in this process. And then, along with the nitrogenous substances in plant and animal remains, these nitrogenous wastes will be broken down by microorganisms in the soil and forms ammonia (NH4+). By the digestion of bacteria in soil, the ammonia is transformed into nitrate (NO3-) that can be absorbed and utilized by plants. At the condition of oxygen (O2) deficiency, the nitrate (NO3-) can be transformed into nitrite (NO2-) by the bacteria in soil, then transforms into gaseous nitrogen and returns to the atmosphere. This process that nitrogen being converted between its various chemical forms is called nitrogen cycle. And BNFF is the product of this process, it is a great fertilizer source to be utilized for agricultural production.
	Different from BNFF, INFF is a kind of artificial nitrogen fixation fertilizer. With the help of today's fertilizer producing technology, we can produce industrial nitrogen fixation fertilizer in a chemical way which requires high temperature and pressure, also metallic iron as catalyst. Tom Philpot's ""A Brief History of Our Deadly Addiction to Nitrogen Fertilizer"" provided us the information that at the end of 19th century, the fertilizer industry pushed the development of global agriculture. As the increasing of population along with the development of industry and the military's demand, artificial nitrogen fixation became one of the most important topic all over the world at that time. July 2nd, 1909, Germany physicist and Chemist Fritz Haber used the temperature of 400 and the pressure of 200 atmos, and metallic iron as the catalyst, successfully made the artificial nitrogen fixation for the first over the world. This artificial nitrogen fixation is called the industrial nitrogen fixation, which is utilized to produce INFF. At that time, industrial nitrogen fixation was a great innovation, this technology played an important role in global agriculture, met the demand for both industry and military.
	In the controversies about which nitrogen fixation fertilizer is better for using, some people hold the statement that BNFF is better than INFF for using in agricultural production due to following reasons that I have concluded:
1. Low cost
The cost of producing INFF is very high, the production of this kind of fertilizer takes a great amount of energy to get high pressure and temperature, this is also why the change of INFF price is so closely tied to the change of fuel price. Instead of being produced in a chemical way, BNFF is produced by nitrogenase catalysis in normal pressure and temperature, transforms nitrogen molecule into ammonia that can be absorbed and utilized by plants. According to ""The Economic Impact of Future Biological Nitrogen Fixation Technologies"" written by Loren W. Tauer (1989), although natural nitrogen fixation consumes energy, the amount of energy is all provided by the plant by utilizing photosynthesis. This means that biological nitrogen fixation fertilizer is a true natural fertilizer, the cost of producing this fertilizer is nearly zero. The cost of producing fertilizer by processing biological nitrogen fixation is much lower than by processing industrial nitrogen fixation.
2. High yield
BNFF also has a higher efficiency on increasing the crop yield than INFF does. For example, the seed treatment with rhizobium leguminosarum is a use of BNFF. H. C. Huang and R. S. Erickson wrote ""Effect of Seed Treatment with Rhizobium Leguminosarum on Pythium Damping-off, Seedling Height, Root Nodulation, Root Biomass, Shoot Biomass, and Seed Yield of Pea and Lentil"", published by ""Journal of Phytopathology"", in January 2007, the article shows us that after using the seed treatments with rhizobium leguminosarum in pea, there has been a significant increase in seed increase of pea (31-37). Experiments demonstrated that in same condition, the pulse which be treated with rhizobium leguminosarum can increase production by 10 to 20 percent.
3. High absorbing ratio
When INFF be used in cropland, only a little amount of the fertilizer will be absorbed by the crops, and the rest part will become gas or be washed away by water, and may cause water pollution <name> <name> personal communication, March 3, 2016). Comparing to INFF, BNFF has a great advantage on absorbing ratio. Most part of biological nitrogen fixation fertilizer can be absorbed by crops directly. The rest part can damp off along with root nodule, and be stored in soil for later use <name> <name> personal communication, March 3, 2016). And therefore, BNFF's high absorbing ratio gives BNFF higher efficiency comparing to INFF.
4. No pollution
From the interview with Dr. <name> <name> I got to know that the using of INFF is harmful to the environment and ecosystem (personal communication, March 3, 2016). Because of the low absorbing ration of INFF, a large amount of INFF has been washed away by water into underwater, rivers and ocean, and cause terrible water pollution <name> <name> personal communication, March 3, 2016). According to ""Biological Nitrogen Fixation"" written by Stephen C. Wagner, published on Nature Education, in 2011, we can see that the use of industrial produced nitrogen fertilizer has led to worldwide, ecological problem, such as the formation of coastal dead zones. Most nitrogenous fertilizer will transform into nitric nitrogen during the using. This can cause nitrate pollution in rivulet, underground water and the ocean. Also, the INFF that used in soil releases nitrogen by denitrification, this amount of nitrogen will disturb the natural nitrogen cycle. Because of BNFF's high absorbing ratio and the nature of being stored in soil, BNFF has the advantage of not causing any environmental pollution, and this advantage is exactly what we need nowadays <name> <name> personal communication, March 3, 2016).
By looking at the advantages of BNFF after comparing to INFF, we can see that BNFF take absolute advantages. However, I believe that BNFF and INFF are both necessary for agricultural production and only managing both of them well can make the highest yield. I have such statement because of the following reasons:
1. Increasing Yield
Dr. <name> mentioned that although INFF is not as efficient as BNFF, it increases crop yield for a considerable amount (personal communication, March 3, 2016). Comparing to traditional fertilizers, the advantage of INFF is obvious. It has a higher efficiency on increasing the crop yield and the production per human worker. According to Berg J. M, Tymoczko J. L, Stryer L.'s ""Nitrogen Fixation: Microorganisms Use ATP and a Powerful Reductant to Reduce Atmospheric Nitrogen to Ammonia"" published by ""W. H Freeman and Company"", INFF can efficiently increase crop yield, it increases a much larger amount of crop than traditional kinds of fertilizer do.
2. Being Manageable
BNFF is hard to be managed, because it is in the soil, so it is also not able to be collect for later use. If the farmers want to use more fertilizer on a certain spot, they cannot only rely on BNFF that is left in the soil from the previous season on this field. According to the information Dr. <name> offered in the interview, INFF is manageable for agricultural works (personal communication, March 3, 2016). Comparing to use BNFF, using INFF can allow the farmers to put the fertilizer exactly where they want and how much they want. This means that the farmers can control the amount of this kind of fertilizer they put into the soil by analyzing the specific situation of a field and managing the fertilizer.
Because of INFF's nature of being manageable, Dr. <name> emphasized that just because that BNFF does not have the ability to be collected and managed, the use of INFF is extremely important and necessary (personal communication, March 3, 2016). I believe that INFF is the key to fertilizer and field management. The kind of fertilizer farmers use depends on the kind of crop farmers grow on the field. For example, on one field, the farmers grew beans last year, if this year the farmer still grows beans, the BNFF that was left in the soil from last year is enough for this year's beans to use. However, if the farmer wants to grow corns on this field this year, the BNFF will not be enough for the corns to use, and as a result, the farmer would need to apply amount of INFF for the corns to use.
	I believe that for higher yield, we need both industrial and biological nitrogen fixation fertilizer. And I am sure that in order to increase crop yield, managing the use of nitrogen fixation fertilizer and keeping the balance between using nitrogen fixation fertilizer and protecting the environment will be today's most important and difficult mission for agronomists and farmers to accomplish.

People should learn more and care more about LGBT teens. 
Homosexual people have been receiving public discriminations for so many years and there have been many issues going on with young LGBT people, such as homeless, violence and psychological problems. Most people are not familiar with LGBT people, they normally have bias on LGBT people and be afraid of this community. I think that people should learn more about the LGBT community and should treat LGBT teens equally. 
First of all, we should find why the discrimination happens. In 
a society that is dominated by heterosexuality, the mainstream values tend to conceal and oppress the people who are different and distinguishable from one social group, religions also put great pressure on LGBT community from hundred years ago. Back in times, LGBT community were invisible and some LGBT people were regarded as criminals or sick people who did not have freedom and rights to love and to live. Although now LGBT don't have threats on living, the misunderstanding still exists between different sexual orientations. I think people could not deny the existences of other kinds of sexual orientation. LGBT people are just humans and they also prove the diversity of the nature. Homosexuality is not a kind of mental or physical problem and they should not be regarded as a weird social group. Kids keep receiving wrong ideas from their parents, society, religions from a generation to next generation and then LGBT people are suffering from social judgment every single day. To eliminate discriminations, my suggestion is that social organizations should provide information about LGBT people to the public and let them know that LGBT people also need care and protection, they are not monsters or sick persons, they were born with their sexual orientation just as who were born with a fixed gender that no one could make their own decision on it. I believe that if people are willing to learn more about LGBT people, they will understand the harsh circumstances of this community, we might not feel how painful it is for LGBT people, but the world would change even with little understandings of each other. 
Second, the LGBT teens are the most fragile people under current social norms and I think that school, family and other social organizations should also provide resources for LGBT teens. It is positive to see that there are more social medias for LGBT teens to consult their psychology issues such as motivation of suicide, also, LGBT people are organizing LGBT teens to share their experiments online and make them feel safe which means teens can find a place where have empathy from people who care about them. Parents should support their LGBT teens and should not kick them out due to sexual orientations. LGBT teens are also child who need love and care, parents need to protect their children. 
LGBT people need to be treated equally. They are human, so are we. We should not classify them as something apart from us. Nobody wants to be resented or inapprehensive. The nature has great diversities, for human, we have different skin color, gender, or shape. The differences between sexual orientations are also part of the nature, people should show respect, and treat each other equally and LGBT people deserve their own rights. The homosexual relationship is same with every heterosexual couple. 
Some people might argue that homosexuality is anti-nature because they could not reproduce. The fact is that many LGBT people would love to have baby so they do the adoption which is an action benefiting the society. People should ask themselves who leave those orphans behind. Some people think that people who be labeled by LGBT means they are doing something ugly such as sleeping around and might transmit disease. Do some of the heterosexual person have more than one sexual partner in their daily life? The answer is obviously yes. However, in a homosexual relationship, people also want to be loyal with their love one just as any other people in the world. 
In conclusion, people's discriminations toward homosexual people come from their lack of knowledge about this kind of people and make the harsh judgment depending on their own imaginations. Nobody will know the taste of an apple without a bite. LGBT people are under unimaginable social pressure. We should care about them, and learn more about them.

Video games have more positive effects than negative effects 
Most reported effects of video games - particularly in the popular press - appear to centre upon the alleged negative consequences (Mark Griffiths). It is true that almost every people around us have bad impacts on video games when we talk about them. Since we were young, parents warm us to stay away from video games and focus more on academic study, and how video games may ruins our life. But the fact is that video games actually have more benefit than people thing, we are just be blinded by public reports. When video games are designed to solve certain problems or to acquire certain skill, they will appear to be considerable success. 
Healthy care is always a top concern for people around the world, meanwhile, video games have link themselves to this topic. In some cases, rehabilitation can be applied with the help of video games. In Mark Griffiths' paper, he shows us a case which video games were used as a treatment tool for patient. A 13 year old boy with Erb's palsy use electronic games to improve his arm control. The authors concluded that the game format capitalized on the child's motivation to succeed in the game and focused attention away from potential discomfort (Mark Griffiths). Another case is that a time travel adventure game format is used to promote adolescents' achieve self-efficacy in HIV or AIDS. This game provides information and opportunities to high-risk people, warm them about what will happen. Safety information was received by participants, and participants get to know their ability to negotiate and conquer HIV or AIDS with potential partner. 
Also, because good learning principles can be incorporated in games, that's what make games improve toward good ways. People are quite poor at understanding and remembering information they have received out of context or too long before they can make use of it [Barsalou 1999; Brown et al. 1989; Glenberg and Robertson 1999]. So in the game System Shock 2, designers put information typically found in manual throughout the game, player can acquire the right information. These information is attached to context and appear constantly when player move through the game, make sure player have a clear idea of how these idea can be applied to that world. Another example I can think of is a game call Minecraft. I have play this game for a long time, it is a really attractive game. Inside of game, player can what to build, how to build base on how they want to. Changing the single element inside of the game make each people's game unique to others. Furthermore, this game can promote player's creative thinking. Player will try to decorate their house in different styles, or defend themselves from dangers through multiples ways. This game make players producers instead of consumers. Too often, students in schools consume, but do not produce, knowledge, and rarely get to help design the curriculum [Brown 1994]. 
Other than entertainments, video games can also be use a research purpose, by using it as research tools. The reason why many people love video games is that they are attractive and full of fun. Some people believe they have the potential to be used as research value to approach learning. Some important skills maybe enforce by video games, like spatial visualization ability, eye-hand co-op, and tactical thinking. Video games can be used as research tool because they have great diversity. And also they are really attractive for people which make participants focus longer in the research than they used could be. Last, they are entertaining and stimulating for participants. 
Although video games have such useful quality, but they can still cause addictive and make player lose self control. One of my participants <Name> indicated that she will invest lots of money to her games. She will use the money to upgrade her items and each cost 20 to 30 dollars, the sum of that is considerable large. For a person who does not have a stable income, this is a behavior of losing self-control and addictive to games. 
Even most people assume video games have more negative effects on people. But the fact is, video games have more potential benefits than we think. We should widely use their good to overcome what bad they have on us.

Credit Cards Negatively Impact on Students 
Using credit cards affects negatively on the financial status of students. Some people may argue that credit cards provide simple and convenient services, making students feel that they have access to free cash that can be used to purchase products they like. However, this feeling stimulates impulsiveness among students and influences their financial condition in a negative way. Students access to a credit card, fail to control their spending habit, and this repeated action makes students compulsive and impulsive on spending. Using credit cards causes serious problems for students as they develop a huge amount of credit card payments and end up in a financial crisis where they fail to save anything and end paying everything for monthly credit card payments. 
	College students are greatly vulnerable to the use of credit cards and they are not mature enough to handle money. Students have less or no experience with managing their money. Age of students is an important period to build a financial plan for students. However, if they misuse and overuse the credit cards, they start to have compulsive spending habit after they apply to credit cards. Many students lose self-control and make impulsive payments, and develop habits of purchasing everything they desire through credit cards. I had interviewed an expert, <name> to discuss students' use of credit cards and the negative effects of credit cards. <name> emphasized the significance of financial management. He said that Students have to construct the healthy financial status in early age to accomplish the steady financial status in the future. Also, the interviewee mentioned that the ""credit cards tempt users to spend more than necessary."" Students hold credit cards with a misunderstanding of credit cards. They treat the credit as their income and overly use the credit cards. As a result, failure to control their spending habits increases their debt and leads to poor credit rating when they fail to pay back the bank before the deadline. 
	Moreover, Credit cards make students are deprived of their saving ability. Services that provided by the credit cards companies stimulate students' spending that uses over the balance even there is a lack of cash. Having credit cards offer the convenient services that students pay or buy immediately without having money with people themselves. However, this convenient service can end up with a terrible outcome. Before students realize the negatives of aspects of using credit cards, they already use the money that they saved and they may not construct the saving habit. In addition, overspending leads to the development of financial anxiety among students as they do not have the financial resources or incoming income to pay the debt back (Limerick & Peltier, 2014). Using credit cards make students blind that they cannot see the future and cannot save their money. 
	Furthermore, many students end up in a risky financial condition as their credit dries up and they do not have the money to service their debt (Robb & Pinto, 2010). As students cannot suppress their impulsiveness, they discover products and services that they desire. Impulsiveness leads to continuous overspending, debt overload, long-term expenses on a credit card, and prevents students from financial gains. Credit card companies charge significantly large interests to students for their services. These large interest payments are above the principal amount that needs to be paid back. Consequently, they are already in a huge amount of debt from the careless spending and large monthly interest payments, However, if students try to save the money and keep the proper budget line, students can collect the money for the future life and they can gain yearly interest from the bank. It is much better than they end up spending huge amounts money by credit cards and pay interest back to the bank. 
Use of credit card has several negative consequences on students who destroy their financial management as they not only need to pay huge interest payments and monthly late fees. Also, using credit card forces students into financial trouble who do not know how to handle their finance. as they spend on products and services that are beyond their financial abilities. The result is seen in their financial condition as students end up in the financial crisis. Their financial condition faced danger when they need to pay the principal amount and the interest payment. Using credit cards also have long-term negative impacts too, as students develop huge credit card debt and develop poor credit ratings. It is important that students fully recognized about how credit cards work and they need to aware the possible negative effects of the using credit cards that can face with the financial crisis.

"Turbochargers vs. Superchargers
If you like to go fast, you want a fast car and fast cars need fast engines. One of the best ways to go from an average of 166 horsepower in your car to a car nearing 1,000 horsepower that can go one quarter of a mile in under 10 seconds is to turbo charge or supercharge your engine (Agency). Superchargers and turbochargers both increase engine performance but neither has been proven better than the other, as evident by an article in The New York Times about Volkswagen's twincharged engine with both a supercharger and a turbocharger working together. The author of the article states that ""Engineers are still trying to determine whether turbochargers or superchargers are superior at increasing an engine's performance"" (SHERMAN). In the last 50 years or so, the debate has become more technical as drivers are looking into forced induction options to push their performance engines. It seems that all the disadvantages of using a supercharger are eliminated by using a turbocharger which in turn has its own disadvantages that are eliminated by using a supercharger. The ideal setup would be a combination of both which, although it has been done, is very complicated and rare. To choose which one is better is very difficult and also depends on the application. This paper will discuss how turbochargers are superior to superchargers for racing applications; however the advantages of superchargers over turbochargers in other applications will be addressed, as well as typical engines.
Forced induction engines are merely engines that contain a unit to compress and force additional air into an engine. This additional air creates more power. These units generally include superchargers and turbochargers. Both have been around since the early twentieth century, and have been used for various applications. Turbochargers were even used on aircraft during WWII. Today, Racing is a major reason why people may decide to supercharge or turbo charge an engine. Racing requires high speed and fast acceleration. Both superchargers and turbochargers can provide better performance for racing than a normal engine containing neither unit. Turbochargers, specifically, provide high amounts of boost to increase acceleration and make your car move very quickly. Although superchargers can do the same, turbochargers can produce more boost than a supercharger is able to, because of the turbochargers many advantages.
Turbocharger Air Flow
1 Compressor Inlet
2 Compressor Discharge
3 Charge air cooler (CAC)
4 Intake Valve
5 Exhaust Valve
6 Turbine Inlet
7 Turbine Discharge
The following is a diagram to help better understand the process of the turbocharger. It shows the flow of air, how the turbocharger is powered, and how it creates power.
(Turbo Tech 101 ( Basic ))
Outside air enters the turbocharger through the compressor inlet (1-2), a turbine that sucks air in; it then travels through the intercooler (3) where it gets cooled before entering the engine. It then enters the engine through the intake valve (4) of a cylinder, after the combustion process it exits through the exhaust valve (5) and into the turbochargers turbine (6-7). As exhaust passes through this turbine, it simultaneously spins the turbine on the compressor inlet (1) side of the turbo. This causes the turbine to draw air into the turbocharger and the engine and begin the cyclical process; this is how it is able to draw more air into the engine (How 2009). That technical explanation may be confusing; so, think of the turbocharger like this: it cannot suck more air into the engine until high amounts of exhaust are being pushed out of the tail pipe. The exhaust gases spin a small turbine that is inside the exhaust (6-7). This turbine is hooked to another turbine (1-2), so as the exhaust turns the first turbine, that turbine spins the second one that it is hooked to. The job of the second turbine is to suck air in and compress it. All the air it sucks in is forced into the engine for higher performance. So essentially, you need more exhaust to get more power, which is why it takes a small amount of time for the turbocharger to build up boost.
The supercharger works similarly, except that the exhaust is not what powers the turbine to suck air in. On a supercharger, a belt from the engine's crankshaft spins the compression turbine sucking air in, compressing it, and forcing it into the engine. It is a slightly simpler design than the turbocharger. To help illustrate the idea of the supercharger, below is a picture showing a supercharger in a car as well as the pulley and belt from the engine that drives it. There is also a diagram showing the basic air flow and powering of the supercharger.

Turbochargers have several other advantages over superchargers. The first one is weight; the turbocharger weighs significantly less than the supercharger (Nice). This is not a big difference; however, it is something to consider when dealing specifically with racing. This is because when racing drivers look want high amounts of power to go fast, but if their car weighs too much, it will put more load on the engine and not be as fast as a lighter car. The second advantage of the turbocharger is that it does not provide boost at low RPMs. RPMs are the speed at which the engine is spinning; it stands for revelations per minute. A lack of boost at low RPMs is good for racing because if you have too much boost at the start, you may end up just spinning your tires in place for a short period of time (also known as a burnout) and not getting a good start (Boodasingh). It is also important because when simply driving through town, the low boost from a supercharger could reduce fuel economy as it pumps more air into the engine, requiring more fuel to be burned. This is something that the turbocharger avoids by producing boost only at higher engine speeds (De Mere). Another important advantage of the turbocharger is that it does not require power from the engine for power. It uses exhaust that would normally be wasted. This is significant because drivers do not have to sacrifice any power from the engine to make power; it uses wasted energy (Ferrari). Nevertheless, there are a couple major disadvantages to the turbocharger. These include the following: lag in power delivery, lack of long-term durability because the parts wear out quickly, and modification to the engine necessary to ensure the turbocharger does not destroy the engine. When applying a turbocharger to an engine, it is necessary to lower the engine's compression ratio and increase the strength of its internal parts as well as the transmission to avoid destroying imperative parts of the engine due to the extra horsepower. However, turbochargers are still superior to superchargers. As for applications, because turbochargers provide greater peak power, they are mostly used on high RPM applications such as 4 cylinder engines in import style cars. Some cars that can be purchased stock with a turbocharger include the Subaru WRX STI, the Mitsubishi Evo, and various others. Not as many cars come from the factory with a turbocharger or supercharger as much as fifteen or twenty years ago when many more cars came stock with turbochargers. The turbocharger has important advantages compared to the supercharger, yet the supercharger does have some advantages over the turbocharger.
The main advantage that the supercharger holds over the turbocharger is that the supercharger can produce an immediate boost and do it at very low engine speeds (RPMs). Because the turbocharger is powered by a turbine in the exhaust system, it produces what is called turbo lag. This lag is because as the driver steps on the accelerator the turbocharger cannot produce an effective amount of boost until there is an increase in exhaust flow to spin the turbine and produce a boost. The supercharger lacks this problem because it is powered by a direct connection to the engine's crankshaft pulley via a belt. Because of this, the supercharger can immediately produce boost as soon as there is an increase in the engines RPMs (De Mere). This is not always desired as mentioned above, but it can be useful for faster starts in racing if you can get a good start. It is most useful in applications such as trucks or muscle cars with V8 engines. This is because V8s contain high amounts of torque and generally do not run at as high of RPMs as smaller engines. Trucks are usually used for low end power with low engine speeds whether it is for pulling or offroading. Because a supercharger can produce good boost at very slow engine speeds, it can provide a significant amount of extra power for trucks. A notable supercharger that has been gaining popularity recently is the Toyota TRD Supercharger. These superchargers provide a very noticeable increase in horsepower and torque and are a great addition for big trucks. In an article about the new supercharger applied to a Toyota Sequoia and a Toyota Tundra, it was stated that the ""New TRD Supercharger [was] Reportedly Rated at 504-Horsepower for [the] 5.7-Liter V8."" That's a significant 123 horsepower increase from the normal 5.7-liter V8 without the supercharger (Levine). Even with these advantages, there are some disadvantages. The main disadvantage of the supercharger is its use of engine power for it to work. It runs off the engine's power to create power and generally produces less peak power than a turbocharger. Although the supercharger has many advantages, the turbochargers advantages are more significant. On the other hand, the average driver may not need a turbocharger or a supercharger.
Some people may not need or want increased engine performance. This is why daily driven type cars, not sport or performance cars, generally come stock with naturally aspirated engines. Naturally aspirated engines are those that contain no form of forced induction. Because forced induction engines force greater amounts of air into the engine, they require more fuel to be burned and therefore reduce the overall fuel economy of the vehicle. Forced induction would probably not be beneficial to any daily driven vehicles even though it increases power. With the constant increase of technology there are certain options to conserve fuel and gain performance, such as superchargers with clutches that only engage at higher engine speeds, as well as other various options. However, these options come at a much greater cost and are not as common as normal superchargers, turbochargers, or naturally aspirated engines. Naturally aspirated engines may be the best option for the majority of drivers.
After looking at the options, consider which one fits you. A simple naturally aspirated engine to get from one place to another without wasting too much gas. A supercharged engine, or a turbocharged engine for high performance and power. For power and performance the turbochargers advantages outweigh those of the supercharger. The turbocharger is lighter, more fuel efficient, and doesn't rob engine power. There are many options out there to get more power from your engine. Although, if you are looking for a powerful engine; turbochargers definitely meet all the needs of a modern performance vehicle to give you a ""boost"" to the finish.

"The relationship between TOFEL and academic success 
Why most of the universities in United Stated required international students to provide their TOEFL score for application? Is this score means everything for a student? Such kinds of questions bothered me a lot when I was preparing to study abroad. As an international student I know how hard it is for us to get a high grade in TOEFL, so when I heard that the minimum requirement for most of the universities in United Stated had increased I seriously shocked and I wanted to know the reasons. Some people support that TOEFL score has no relationship with academic success. But after I searched the Internet and made an interview with the director in Purdue admission office, I found out the reason: TOEFL score is actually somehow positive related with students' academic behaviors. 
Based on the resource that I found before, I support that TOFEL score has very important influence on academic success. TOEFL, based on the definition from ETS, is a test of English as foreign language. According to <name> personal communication, March 22th, 2016, TOEFL mean nothing except the test for English ability. University will accept a student with 80 TOEFL score also a student with 115 TOEFL score 120 in total. But university have to make sure the basic English ability for student to understand the professor. So the TOEFL score requirement for international students at most universities is just to determine students' eligibility. Also, the reason why most universities increase their TOEFL requirement is the increasing applications. Actually the increasing is about everypart of the application but just the data part like score is the most obvious one. So in his opinion, as long as one international students' TOEFL score match the requirement, which means the basic English ability, he will do well in the university. But if he doesn't match the basic requirement, he will definitely fail in the class. 
Also, the requirement of TOEFL, in general, varies between undergraduate and graduate programs. In fact, this requirement varies from college to college in one university. This is based on the research from K, Jacob N. 2007, Relationship between TOEFL score and academic success for international engineering student. This research did a lot of methodological data collection, also including data analysis. So the result is based on the data calculation. The researcher did a lot of survey to find out the difference between the ""university overall GPA"" and the ""engineering student GPA"". Also some of other college students like college of business and college of arts & science. Although the relationship between TOFEL and ""engineering student GPA"" is smaller than we thought, the major that needs writing or speaking skills, is tightly related to TOFEL. Moreover, the GPA of students of college of business and college of Art & Science are quit relatively with TOFEL K, Jacob N. 2007. 
Furthermore, a Canadian Psychological Association compared the academic behavior of students who have different TOFEL score. It shows that students with higher TOFEL scores perform better in academic, and I really agree with this statement. TOFEL score can be evaluating the applicants' English ability. There is an example of my friends, Alice and Jim. Their major is communication which needs students have higher speaking and writing skills than others. Alice gained an A in com114's course and could understand other courses' contents easily, because her speaking and listening grade of TOEFL is 28 and 27. Such high grades show that she is able to speak and listen without barrier. On the other hand, Jim worked hard and final gained 21 and 19 in speaking and listening. Although he reached the minimum requirement of TOEFL in Purdue, he is still difficult to understand what his professor saying. Listening section in TOEFL is similar to real universities' courses, so such a simulation can greatly test the students' abilities to understand the courses. Moreover, the speaking section is related about topics of daily life and opinions of academic knowledge. Jim could not express his view clearly when he was taking TOEFL test. It is normal that he cannot communicate with others or perform well in his communication course. In conclusion, their TOEFL scores tightly connect with academic behaviors. 
In summary, no matter the information I found on newspaper, website, and interview, the TOEFL score has slightly but critical relationship with students' academic behavior in university. The reason why university requires TOEFL score is to make sure international has basic English abilities to understand when they are taking classes and finishing homework. Imaging that a student from non-English country who has poor TOEFL score cannot understand the extra credit getting by I-clicker and the homework due date or time. How poor his score could be at the final because he can't even understand the question! This is the reason why university needs TOEFL. Also, the reason for increasing TOEFL score is the increasing number of international students, so universities need to find a way to choose their students. Actually not the TOELF requirement increased. There are many requirements like essay also increased, but they are just not so obvious like ""score"" increased. Nevertheless, a student with higher TOEFL will definitely feel easier when they get into university, even though the advantage is not evident.

American Culture Imperialism on China's Society: Enlightenment and Predication 
American culture imperialism on China's Society remains a huge issue, as I perceive on modern era. However, because such imperialism is quite dispersed within too many aspects or governments are too focused on economics development, Chinese people seem pay so little attention to it. As I have done research on it for a long period, I find cultural imperialism is playing much more important role on the disparity between China and America. The trend somehow reveals that Chinese not only have to pay attention to it, but also have to study thoroughly about how it originates and what we can see it in the future. Personally, I would like to present this circumstance with different aspects embodied on Chinese's society. Therefore, I believe American cultural has imperialism on China's society on many aspects. 
In the first place, movie industry is a huge market where this situation happens the most. According to the recent statistics of 2015 movies so far, we see that American movies possess over ninety percent of China's box office revenue. Besides, there are only two movies on the top ten of the list. There is something worse that I concern: The real cause probably is because our citizens are too busy and take movies as relaxation. Thus they never think or care about why this happens. As decades have passed, we automatically take it as usual. The fact is movie industry is huge on recreation market and has so many related industry which contributes a lot to the imperialism. In this way, there is no reason why Chinese have to deeply concern about this issue and discover how we can improve on it. 
Secondly, I would talk about the whole entertainment industry which includes sports, pop music etc. As a basketball fan, I have watched NBA for almost ten years; Also as music fan, I have listened to American music for a long time of period. First of all let's have a look how many profits American entertainment industry gain from Chinese for the past five years. As statistics, only those jerseys, albums and concerts can only be counted with billions! That is so huge when we pile them up. In china, we have similar sports league and renounced singer. But why we cannot be successful as they do? As I perceive, there are many little details that could cause the phenomenon. For instance, players are required to receive college education before they step into NBA. This is important because they are cultivated in a professional sportsmanship. For singers, they are not only singers. They have successful records companies behind, experienced manager, excellent producing team and perfect assistant. All those people who work in a long time can lead to good chemical reaction which made their success quite easily than others. In comparison to what we have in China, it is not surprised that why imperialism is so significant. 
Another point that can be ignored is the fast food industry. Although brands such as Mc Donalds, KFC and Coca-Cola have been consumed by Chinese by billions each year, people seldom understand why this enthusiasm never retreat for such a long time. As I perceive, those ""cultural"" belongs to modern cultural, which means they originated from just very short time ago. Their success can be mostly concluded to their marketing strategies. For example, Fast-food chains are professional in studying Chinese appetites and frequently improving menus in order to achieve people's highest satisfaction. For beverages and other cuisine business, they are very good at selling methods. For instance, Coca-Cola does not only have different favors, but also different volumes of drinks which create huge convenient for customers. Also they pay lot efforts to designing delicate outlooks. These little detailed improvements might seem irrelevant to their huge success. However, as the old saying ""Rome wasn't built in one day"", those details contribute a lot to American's culture success as accumulation in the long run business. 
The fact is that when there are proponents, there must have opponents. Most people who think folks overestimate this issue keep two opinions: They either think culture is not such an competitive power as economics or military force or they consider cultural imperialism is just something people create but do not exist. I would like to talk about the second issue first. The reason why people use the word ""imperialism"" is because it really exists. A very common phenomenon is the language. Think about how many millions children are learning English today. What behind the scene is that language dominates most of industries and let America takes advantage of many fields. What's more, many kids of the new generation are raised up with cartoons like Disney, Hollywood movies and eating imported snacks. As a result, they take this issue naturally thinking American cultural and products are just better then ours. Back to the first point, there are many evidences showing that cultural are becoming the number one factor influencing China's development. For instance, the reason why so many American companies put all their efforts on Chinese market is because we have such huge population. So every move they take, it cause such huge impact that other dozens of countries couldn't have. Take example of Los Angeles Lakers an example. As an successful team with glorious history, its influence is incomparable. Consequently, their related products such as jerseys, hats and clothes are earning huge profits in China. Also because of such effect, they prefer to arrange more matches in China. Not to mention other teams such as Yankees, Patriots etc who produce unimaginable revenue each year. Not only sports, high technologies such as Apple, Dell who has renounced reputation also are very popular among China. In this way, it somehow have huge impact on China's development. As I perceive, as more Chinese recognize American's lifestyles and ways of thinking, we cannot prevent such large-scale imperialism from happening. 
To sum up, American Cultural Imperialism has such huge impact on China's society and it will continue for a long time. The reason why it is somehow invisible to people is because we have to see the things from a different angle. It could be a good thing if Chinese pay much attention to it and learn the good sides from it; it can also be a negative issue if Chinese just take those for fun and never think what is really behind.

Positive aspects of homesickness 
Feeling homesick is a natural reaction most of us experience when we move on from place of our life to another and leave important relationships behind. Freshmen in collage are a group of people who will easily get homesick. If a student feels sad and lonely, thinks about people at home all the time, wants to go home every weekend, and just feel generally depressed, then he or she is probably homesick. Most people probably just recognize the negative side of homesickness; however, I believe that despite homesickness leading to various negative aspects, it also brings a significant amount of positive aspects. 
	For my first reason, I would like to point out that getting far away from home also means getting independent from parents, which is good to feel confident doing things on our own. John Osborne who wrote ""Homesick in The Modern World"" believes that students contact their home relatively fewer times makes them able to differentiate their new world and new identity from their old identity that they had growing up with1. When I'm just by myself and can make my own rules, it is an introspective and empowering moment because I am the sole controller of what happens. Also, independence helps gain perspective on our life because it is good to just be by ourselves and spend some time to relax just thinking and enjoying our time alone. If we can be self-reliant and do things on our own, figuratively and metaphorically, then we are in result in charge of our destiny and are strong enough to survive new our foreign lives. 
	The second reason that feeling homesick have good respective is that we do benefit from this kind of challenge. John Osborne claims that a part of adjusting to a new place is discovering ways to use one's skills. It seems like when we get into a completely new environment and surrounded with strangeness and loneliness, the difficulty we face in turn forces us to grow as an individual. With challenge, we are able to discover more about ourselves and what we are good at; we are able to grow as a person when we engage in introspective thinking. I have to admit that I used to think it was possible to ""stop the waves"" and avoid all the challenges life throws at me; however, after I felt homesick since being at Purdue for a couple of weeks, I realized that the only way to face such an incredible life changing challenge was to stop running away from it and to instead try to conquer it. So, instead of trying to make life free of challenges, all we need to understand is how to best ride the waves because challenges are going to come our way from time to time. 
	The third reason that justifies my opinion that feeling homesick can be good for us is that we can benefit from meeting new people and making some new friends around us. John Osborne had two good friends at Vienna, the place he felt homesick when he just moved to, and they were the people who made he feel like staying there a little longer2. When you meet new people, you can be potentially introduced to new opportunities and explore new ideas. You don't want to miss out a specific angle on something just because you never took the time to address it with someone. In addition, by meeting new types of people you expose yourself to new knowledge and increase your knowledge on a variety of topics. In the end, the benefits of meeting new people far exceed not getting out there taking chances. 
	Many will argue that being homesick for a long time will influence academic performance, make freshmen feel stressful, and can even lead to depression; therefore, it is totally bad thing to students. I believe that some of the words hold true, but I would still say everything has two sides; it truly depends on which perspective you are taking on. Even the experience of homesickness gives to a student makes him or her feel upset, one will cope with this sense of feeling more easily in the future. Even students are far away from relatives and friends and likely feel unhappy, but the independence the get will help them a lot with managing their own life and building up their personality. Even the challenges students will face probably are the toughest issue they ever experience, but challenges help shape our character, round out any rough edges, give us lessons we need for our future success and most importantly allow us to realize that we absolutely can manage through anything that comes our way. 
	People may still think that students who feel homesickness have a hard time adjusting to the new environment so they barely have friends. However, people who is always willing to make new friends will pour themselves out in the new environment actively, try to meet and talk with more people, and make new friends eventually because the new environment is the motivation of them. Most people will somehow try to talk to others, even if they are shy and not that talkative, because they are forced to make friends by the brand new surroundings or they will feel extremely uncomfortable because of nobody to talk to. So, only under some pressure and challenge, skills will be stimulated. 
	I believe that homesickness has its positive aspect by making us experiencing something new, gaining independent and forcing us to challenge ourselves. Although there are shortcomings in this opinion of mine, I believe that the benefit students will get will overshadow the negative effects of homesickness.

"Video Games: A New Era of Sports? 
A few days ago, Kobe Bryant just retired from NBA, which is a real and traditional sport association. Myriad of people in the world sat in front of televisions and shared this moment with each other. We all say that this twenty-years long journey of a man is a miracle and we all feel the power from a basketball athlete. And half a year ago, on the other side of the earth, an eminent player of Star Craft, Lee 'Flash' Young Ho retired from his team. Flash's career created a new and hard-to-reach height for every Star Craft player. Until today, many players still respect him as the greatest player of Star Craft. They are elites in different domain and both respected by people. As I say, an e-sport player can be treated as a traditional sport player. Therefore, video games should be seen as a sport just like how people treat video game players. 
But, not all people respect Kobe Bryant, Flash as the same kind of players. Many people don't believe that basketball, video games could be categorized as sports. They used the definition from Merriam- Webster Dictionary as a kind of evidence: ""Sport is a contest or game in which people do certain physical activities according to a specific set of rules and compete against each other."" Mish et al. 2004 They emphasized 'physical activities' and mentioned that video games can contain a part of competition, but none of them requires high physical ability. In addition, games like Star Craft need participants play computer games, they should consider the accurate time to push forward and conquer their enemies' territory in order to win a match. These players fight for themselves and do not need to collaborate with others. However, for those traditional sports, like basketball, team spirit is vital to win. In effect, those people think video games are totally unrelated to sports. Matthew Clough, 2016 
Are those statements above true? For me, the answer is no. After I read an article which supports that video games should not be classified as a sport. I noticed there was only one comment at the bottom of the page. It said in a cynical way: 'If stupidity has mass, then you are a black hole. -----from gamers'. As a truth, video game players trained day by day and their APM can be over 1200-means more than twenty actions done by keyboard and computer mouse in one second. People cannot reach such a value of APM without any training. In this way, e-sport gamers also require to have strong bodies. Furthermore, those professional players understand that they can only get a few dollars, no more than ten thousands of dollars by playing games one year. For instance, the whole bonus pool of GSL Finals usually is only one percent of Kobe Bryant's salary which is twenty-two millions of dollars. But they still practice dedicatedly and diligently. Most players dedicate best time of their life into video games. The debut of Flash was at the time when he was only 14 years old. And he left his stage eight years later. At the same age, we are in school and quarrel with our parents. For their dedication, video games are more popular among different generations and becoming a beloved pastime, sport. Thus, they should be esteemed as athletes. 
From what Matthew Clough said, it is stupid and ridiculous to make team spirit equal to sports. There is no doubt that most physical sports need cooperation, good assist and support from your teammates. But, to rebut this, the first thing comes to my mind is table tennis Ping-Pang and then boxing, high jump, long jump. So many sports could and should be done by one person. Players may get aid from their coaches, analysts and medicals, but in the match, on the way to break records and limits, there is no team spirit. Thus, nobody is able to say that video games should not be classified as sports because video games don't require team spirit, no need to mention those games what are played by several members, for example LOL DOTA... And of course, as I said before, a strong physical exertion is also a demand of video games. 
In the future, VR equipment becomes common in people's life. More jerk need to be done while playing computer/video games. As a truth, not all video games can be seen as a sport. But for those games including athletic ability and mental strength, when played in VR instruments, would be more like, even same as those conventional sports. 
But still, VR is an illusion right now. Keyboard, Computer mouse and Game grip are still the trident of video games and discrimination of video games always exists. I still remember the day of GSL finals, the host said to the champion Im MVP another South Korean Star Craft player and audience with tears in his orbits: 'My parents said to me, Jones, it is just a game, quit it.' Yes, so many people are 'racist', not for ethnicity, but for matches. Nevertheless, before the light from dawn, there always is full of dark. I also remember that host said in the end:"" Being here today, people from all over the world, share this moment. It is nothing that money can do. It is a miracle."" Exactly, it is a miracle and it is a new era.

"Chinese E-business is Bound to Step into Maturity 
Because of its convenience and low-price, almost everyone has been involved into the mania of shopping online in China. Indeed, e-business provides consumers a platform where they can buy whatever bargain they want without walking out of their bedroom. At the same time, consumers want to avoid being trapped by annoying traffic jams. However, dishonesty of sellers and the fact that consumers lack confidence in internet banking services have become the most critical barriers restricting the success of Chinese e-businesses. To solve these difficulties, some people think positively that the cooperation between the government and consumers is bound to settle the problems. On the contrary, others believe that trust is not so easy to form after long time experiences of deception. In my opinion, any behavior which goes against the law can be controlled by a mature regulation system. 
As the main character of the commerce, the government take the responsibility of protecting the rights of consumers. There is lack of the regulation that restrict the qualification of online sellers which leads to the confounding e-market. If the government carries out the new laws or rules aimed at the standard of the operation of the e-business, the dishonest behavior of sellers will get greatly reduced. It is normal that every seller desires to make more profit. So it is necessary to eliminate the devious methods by the power of the laws. Only by being faced with the restriction from government can Chinese e-business step into integrity. 
Besides the effort of government, the consumers should make use of the rating system to distinguish which is with good quality. Although it is easy for online sellers to cheat consumers on the quality of the goods, the reputation got from rating system is no doubt helpful to identity which one has better feedbacks. For example, the completed rating system gets rid of lots of illegal deals in Amazon and E-bay. American consumers make advantage of these rating system to leave responsible feedback. Moreover, the new consumers can turn to old consumers for help. Any confusion like if the size of the shoes is suitable will get settled on this useful platform. You can hardly find fakes in the American e-business. Therefore, Chinese consumers also should evaluate the sellers by rating their goods sold before. 
On the contrary, lots of people refute that these solutions just flog a dead horse. The number of online sellers in China is too limitless to control the whole e-market. Anyone who wants to sell goods can have the eligibility to sell them online. That's why there are so many fakes in the e-shop. However, I am opposed to this opinion. Recent years, Chinese government and public have taken action to resist dishonest behaviors in e-business. China first introduced its Consumer Protection Law in 1993. Twenty years later, in 2013, the law's first revision was made. ""3/15 Consumer Protection Day"", para1 The new law still works nowadays. There are many improvements compared to the old one. For example, the delivery fees for returning the product shall no longer paid by consumers. And the deadline for consumers paid back is seventh days after returning the product. This is known as the ""seven-day unconditional return"". ""3/15 Consumer Protection Day"", para3 Besides that, the new law said that advertising agents and e-trade platforms should take the responsibility if they sold harmful products. Also, organizations and individuals that endorse those goods and services will share responsibility as well. ""3/15 Consumer Protection Day"", para4 In another words, there is no false advertising any more. The new law sets regulations on the e-commerce industry for the first time. ""3/15 Consumer Protection Day"", para5 The consumers can return unsatisfactory products by multiple ways before the deadline. 
In any case, with more and more problems of Chinese e-commerce appearing, corresponding solutions have to be come up. The government should carry out some laws or regulations to punish the dishonesty of the deal online such as goods of bad quality and fictitious discount. The consumers should make use of the rating system to identity which one had better feedbacks. There is no doubt that e-business will grow increasingly. However, the e-market will lose control without the regulation from government and supervision from consumers. The cooperation of the government and public is the vital part of e-business operation. Frankly speaking, not only the consumer needs an organized e-market, but also the seller, who wants a favorable platform where they can compete with each other fairly. Consequently, Chinese e-business will step into maturity soon with the effort of its Chinese supporters.

"Living with roommates 
Never have human beings enjoyed such ""huge and great"" connection between each other by the innovation of computers and phones, and, most of all, Internet. While having a wonderful time chatting with friends with a highly advanced tool, people start to forget the ability to solve conflicts among individual in a mature way. One projection of this scenario occurs when people have roommates. Most people on this earth have had or still have roommates to live with for various reasons. Along with this popularity, there are problems. As I mentioned in my previous paper, conflicts will take place as long as the roommates have a different expectation concerning to any aspects of life. So in order to solve these discords and have a delightful future, we need to take action; we have to face and solve the problems and we have to confront and communicate with roommates. 
To begin with this topic, we have to understand that there are a lot of people who have to live with roommates. The reason is really simple, that is people want to save money. From my personal experience, I know we can save a lot of money by living with someone else. When I went to look for an apartment to live, I got the information that if I want to live alone in a suite, 875 dollars per month will be cost to pay the rent, not to mention the expensive fee of electricity and water. However, I will only need to pay 410 per month if there are other 3 people to live with me. So in this economic era, it is really crucial for people to budget wisely, and living with roommates to share the living cost will be a smart choice. To sum up, sometimes, we just need to live with someone for couple of reasons. We cannot just run away from people just because we don't want to deal with human conflicts. 
After we have the understanding that it is a better option if we just live with someone, now the fact that there will always be conflicts between people also need to be learned. And if there is an issue, we need to solve it before it goes too far. What I mean here is ignoring the problems between roommates will lead terrible or even dreadful outcome. In April 2013, there was a murder in the Fudan University in China. The crime was committed by a student who was constantly annoyed by his roommates' lifestyle and then a fight between them finally led to the murder. Furthermore, A 19-year-old student was charged with fatally stabbing her roommate, and the reason she committed such a crime was so na ve even ridiculous: she was unhappy about music volume playing from an i Pod of her roommate. These are extreme examples caused by morbid psychology. In daily life, we can see a lot of people choose to move out and change roommates due to some grudge between people. These are all unhealthy way to dealing with a roommates' disagreement. Neither should we just run away from it, nor should we take drastic action, what we really need to do is sit down and talk about the problems. 
Finally, there is a lot of benefit when we successfully address a roommates' problem. As we step in to society, we will run into people who are different than us and have disagreement with us the skill of solving these problems need to be established and is valued by a lot of company. Plus, during the talking, we can really understand what the real problems are. Maybe the issues arise because of one party or maybe problems are caused by both parties, and the gist of talking is that, either way, people can learn and perfect themselves after realizing what they did is wrong. What's more, the correction among roommates makes people get progress and then great friendship may begin. 
Nevertheless, there are people who suggesting that someone just is rich enough to live alone and is quite fond of loneliness. In this case, I can only bless this kind of individuals for they have lost so much. Living with roommates has give people a lot of advantages. Living with someone means people will perform better on their working and studying stage (as is shown by an article in my synthesis paper); living with someone means people can always get help on time; living with roommates means people can expand their social circle. In a word, there are so many benefits that people will gain from live with roommates. Furthermore, there are people who, on the contrary, hold the view that it is unnecessary to talk, since some people just cannot be talked sense into. In this case, I believe people may need some extra help. If you are a resident in a university or a school, Residence Assistant is a great option to ask for help if your roommates are crazy enough so that you cannot even talk to them. If you rent an apartment, the landlord is a good option, but if the situation gets worse, you may need to call the media or even police. 
""Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing."" Says from a great man Rollo May. Only through communication and confrontation can people truly begin to know each other and then walk in others' shoes. If someone has the chance to live with roommates, I'd say: ""go for it."" If there are conflicts between them, I'd say: ""that's even better, because this is the chance of people getting progress and making friendship."" In the end, I just want every one on this earth can treat each other with love and patience, so the world won't be controlled by some computers or cell phones but be a better place for people to talk face-to-face and to live.

"The disappearance of softball in Brazil can be avoided 
Brazil was the host of the 2014 World Cup and will be the host of the Olympic Games in 2016, and for this reason, most people expect a great interest and commitment with sports from the Brazilian Government. However, this is not what happens. The Brazilian Government only cares about soccer, which leaves the others sports without almost any publicity, causing - in some cases - a tendency to the disappearance of some sports, including softball. 
This possibility of the disappearance of softball might be a result from the Brazilian Government opinion about Softball not being as important as Soccer is. However, they are wrong. Softball, as any other sport, can bring health to the body and mind of the athletes, but also, differently from many other team sports, softball can bring family together. And for this reason, something has to be done to guarantee the longevity of softball in Brazil. 
Softball in Brazil was never really popular in Brazil, and the responsible for that is part from the Brazilian government lack of interest in sports (except soccer) and also a part from the Japanese community. In their Immigration to Brazil, in 1908 (according to Gobrazil.about.com) the Japanese immigrants brought with themselves their culture, thus, they brought softball to Brazil. Besides softball, they also brought their tradition of ""isolating"" their community from the rest of the country, which resulted in the non-spreading of softball to the rest of the country. For this reason, even nowadays - more than a hundred years later - the majority of softball players are Japanese descendant. 
Although only the Japanese community had access to softball, they manage to gather enough people to be able to play the sport, but nowadays softball is losing so many athletes, that the Japanese community is not as much involved as it was before, which means that the possibility to the disappearance of the sport is becoming more real. 
It is extremely necessary to reinforce the importance of softball and its benefits in order to avoid its disappearance. For example, besides the cardio exercise that almost every sport provides, according to the journal article ""The science of softball"", softball also provides the visual acuity benefit. The visual acuity is the ability that softball players develop to a better visual hardware, which means that softball players have an ability to ""predict"" a movement or a play before it occurs. This benefit can also be used outside the field, because it enhances the overall ability of scanning and processing information, which is useful to daily decision-making. 
According to an interview with Camila Mayumi O. Silva, one of the most experienced softball players in Brazil, another benefit of softball is the possibility of building relationships as a kid (personal communication, October 14, 2014). In her interview, she acknowledged that softball helped her with her social skills and also brought so many good moments to her life, regarding her friends and the environment of the sport. In this way, besides the health benefits, softball also allows the good moments and memories that an entertainment can bring. 
Unfortunately, softball still is not available to everyone yet. For being not popular, the sport is very expensive, which most of the times is the reason that athletes are quitting playing it. None of the necessary equipment of softball, such as cleats, bats, mitts and helmets, are produced in Brazil, which makes the people interested in softball obligated to import from United States, most of the times. In this way, it seems that if softball was more popular in Brazil, the equipment will be more available in the country, and therefore, more accessible to everyone, making it more cheap. 
In order to make the equipment available for the softball players, first, something has to be done to increase the number of softball players, and according to Amber Patton, a top American professional softball player who gave an interview for ""The New York Times"" called ""Loving softball is easier than living it"" the way to increase the popularity of softball, is to publicize and get exposure to the sport. In her opinion, the advertisement and exposure of softball will increase the popularity and appreciation for he sport. 
In this way, in order to guarantee the visual acuity and the good moments that softball has to provide, first, something has to be urgently done to avoid the disappearance of softball in Brazil. Therefore, if the Brazilian government invest in as much exposure, publicity and advertisement to softball as it does for soccer, the popularity of softball in Brazil will increase significantly, and the disappearance of the sport will be avoided.

685 words. 
College students are encouraged to take internship as soon as possible. 
Each student wants to make as much effort as they can in order to succeed, not only during their time in college, but also after their graduation. In order to fulfill their potential, some students choose to take an internship during summer or winter break. This is simply because they believe that the importance of internship can never be ignored. For numerous benefits that internships provides, college students can take full advantages and apply these advantages wisely in the future job markets. Therefore, college students are encouraged to take internships as early as they can. 
The importance of internship can never be underestimated. Nowadays, the internship has enjoyed the high popularity in many universities. There are increasing large numbers of institutes, universities expend their major program into internship. Students are encouraged, even required, to take internship. This is simply because companies nowadays are no longer barely seeking students who only have high GPA. As students take internships, they can not only acquire real-world experience, but also reflect ability of engaged learning. According to Gilroy (2014), companies are seeking for potential employees who have tried one or several internship during their college time, stimulating more schools to put internship in students' graduation requirement. In that case, students who had internship during their college time are more likely to win the opportunities in job markets. Also, for my interview with Qixian Tong, who did three internships during his college time, he emphasized, ""Without his previous internships he would never get his current job"". Based on these examples, both Gilroy and Tong's experience show that internships are very important to college students. 
Moreover, the benefits that internships provide can also lead college students to future success. There are lots of benefits that internships provide, like professional skills, salary that companies provide, and network with internship's companies. When students take internship, they can enjoy these advantages at the same time. According to Greer (2013), most of internships would help students determine which specific area they want to work for in the future. This is beneficial because many students with certain majors still do not have clear images of what they want to be or where they want to work in. With this practical recourse of help, they will have some ideas about future occupations and working environments. For <name>'s example, he talked about his experience in Mc Kinsey is doing regular job, like morning conference, assigned work, and checking off work list, repetitively. It is not like what he did at school. After all, he admitted that it is little boring to take this routine work, but he does not hate his job and it is totally fine if his future job is like this. 
Some people may claim that it is better for college students to take internships at their junior or senior year instead of freshmen and sophomore, as for they have acquire enough knowledge and can work effectively as they join companies. However, this is not a comprehensive idea. Internship plays a role that connects classrooms and jobs. During the internship, students still can learn some interpersonal skills, acquire professional knowledge, and handle with the real world problem, which they will never learn when professor is giving a lecture. Future more, learning never ends after the classes. By taking the internship as early as possible, they can have opportunities to try to deal with these problems, practice what they have learnt in class, and find out their individual skills and goals (Coco, 2000). For the major, construction engineering and management, in our school, they require students to take internship every summer as their prerequisite for higher level courses. It clearly shows that students should take internships as early as they can. Therefore, there is no reason for students to expect to take internship in their senior year. The more internships you taken, the more working experience you will get, and the more chances you will win in the future job markets. 
To sum up, college students should pay more attention to internships, take full advantages of internships, and try to take internship as soon as possible.

"Cultural shock 
Can you imagine a college life without a close friend? According to a survey in 2012, 40% of foreign students in the US have no close friends on campus. This is one of the affects of cultural shock: the loneliness. These days, the number of international students in US increases rapidly. Most of them are facing some problems because of cultural shock. So what should they do to solve these problems. What is the best solution of cultural shock for international students. Some people hold the idea that students can solve their problems by themselves naturally. They think that students do not have to do something on purpose. I think cultural shock is a serious problem, if students do not treat it seriously, they will get in trouble sooner or latter.

"The beneficial aspects of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder which affects two to three percent of people all over the world. OCD can be briefly defined as ""a process of intensive worry followed by compulsive rituals or behaviors."" (Dr. Eiler) Commonly, OCD patients are used to doing such repetitive behaviors as checking whether the stove is turned off or the door is locked. Unwanted thoughts, fears and worries are some symptoms of obsession. OCD results from both biological bases and environmental issues. The public view some symptoms of OCD patients negative, because they think they are strange. However, there are some beneficial aspects of OCD. The benefits of OCD include risk avoidance, a survival advantage and improved quality of life. 
Those who ostracize OCD patients consider OCD is a mental illness, however, it actually has some benefits. Most human beings have the ability of noticing risk factors subconsciously, which is an over-activity area of the brain. Thus, this certain area results in obsessions and compulsions (Riadh, et. al. 1998). To be more precise, obsessions are ancient and repetitive phenomena, which people do them involuntarily. For this reason, people generate risk scenarios which they intend to avoid. In other words, people have the capability of identifying the risks in daily lives and they want to prevent them happening. With this process, people could avoid harm without experiencing it. The aforementioned indicates that OCD has a positive origination that is a risk avoidance process. 
Not only does OCD originate from a positive process, but also OCD benefits people's survival. For example, there were two cavemen called Bernie and Charlie. In fact, Bernie was an OCD patient while Charlie was not. When they slept, Charlie was afraid of nothing and was so relaxed. However, Bernie was worried about lots of things, such as whether there would be bugs, snakes and tigers. So he slept inside the cave where he could listen to Charlie's scream in case he would in danger (Fredric, 2012). When people are not at a place that is safe enough, they should have the intention to avoid danger. Due to Bernie's OCD, he noticed a lot. He and his friend would be less dangerous to some extent. That is to say, Bernie had the consciousness to avoid risks, but Charlie who was a relaxed person did not. What's more, Edna, who was Bernie's cousin, was a cavewoman with OCD. When she was pregnant, she washed her hands quite often. She did know the mold which would do harm to her body though she knew nothing about germs. Edna always stayed away from sick people and the smoke. She never drank berry juice and took drugs. Last but not least, Edna had an extremely healthy diet. If she had some worry about the food, she would let the dog had a try first. Because of Edna's OCD symptoms, she was the only person who had more than three children in the tribe and raised them healthily. From the experience of Bernie and Edna, we can conclude that in some situations, people with some symptoms of OCD which can make them have a survival advantage. 
In addition to being a survival advantage, mild OCD can improve the quality of people's daily lives, like making materials extremely tidy and clean. Suppose a person has OCD, in his home the bed is made tidy, the plates are washed shiny, the floor is mopped clean, the books are neatly arranged. The visitor will have a good mood by visiting this beautiful house. 
Moreover, if students have a little OCD, they will be used to checking carefully whether they have already done homework everyday, and make up study materials for next day's courses. Hence, they will be less likely to make such mistakes like forgetting to do homework or to bring essential study materials to class. During my interview with Dr. Eiler, who is a staff therapist at PUSH, she said that ""A little OCD could make people focused. Many successful people have a little OCD."" OCD can be considered as a continuum, ranging from mild to severe. If people have mild OCD, they could take advantage of the benefits of OCD, like perfectionism, carefulness and tidiness to improve the quality of study and daily lives. OCD is not a totally harmful disorder, if people have a little OCD, they have some habits which can increase the quality of daily lives. 
In conclusion, OCD originates from a risk avoidance process, OCD patients have a survival advantage and a little OCD could make people focused which could improve people's daily lives. Although OCD is a mental illness, the public should also be educated to pay attention to the beneficial aspects of OCD.

The X-ray Crystallography Helps Avoid Diseases 
	Viruses are everywhere and they never stop bothering our life, because they are always looking for chances to infect our body system to process reproduction and diseases. Virus is very tiny so it is hard to observe and defend them. To better understand virus and how it protects us away from disease, scientists invented a technology to visualize molecular level things, which is called X-ray crystallography. Because the structural information of bacterial and viral proteins can be collected and analyzed in detail by analyzing the density of electrons in X-ray crystallography, I believe the X-crystallography is the best technology to study the atomic and molecular structures including the bacterial and viral proteins. However, some people argue that X-ray crystallography will never be a good technology because its limitations such as its inability of examining proteins that cannot be crystalized. For the argument of the limitation of X-ray crystallography, I will provide examples and data to support my statements. 
	First of all, the X-ray crystallography is extremely important because it can help researchers determine the viral protein structure. It is commonly acknowledged that the activities of life forms mainly rely on the complex and specific proteins, while the complexity and specificity of proteins are based on their structures. X-ray crystallography is widely used for observation of atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, including viral protein. By exposing the crystallized viral proteins to X-rays, the diffraction of X-ray beams could be obtained. A crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal by measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams. The electron density helps researchers determine the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal, as well as their chemical bonds, their disorder and various other information. X-ray crystallography is proved to be an effective way to study viral proteins by scientific researches. In 2015, Dr. Michael G. Rossmann in Purdue University studied the EV-68(Enterovirus 68, which was a virus that could cause respiratory disease among children) and determined its viral protein structure by X-ray crystallography. Based on the 3D image of EV-68 protein portrayed by X-ray crystallography, Dr. Rossmann's research team found a specific viral protein molecular shaped like a pocket, which was proved to be a receptor for signals of infection. The molecular was named as ""pocket factor."" Based on the finding of pocket factor, it is practicable to develop a new drug which can exactly inhibit the binding of ligand to the pocket factor and prevent the respiratory diseases. 
	Besides, compared to other similar technology, X-ray crystallography is more flexible. When I interviewed <Name>, she mentioned that the cost of X-ray crystallography was lower than other technologies. For example, although NMR technology (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) has similar function with X-ray crystallography and can measure objectives that cannot be crystallized, the cost of the experimental implementation is increasing with the higher strength and the complexity of the determination in NMR, while the cost of X-ray crystallography is much lower. Also, X-ray crystallography is very flexible because it can be used to corporate with other technologies. For instance, X-ray crystallography is usually worked with cryo EM (cyroelectron microscopic), which is a technology to gain polarity of samples in structural biology by putting the samples at cryogenic temperature and observed the samples by electron microscopy (EM). The combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo EM could significantly increase the accurate of data. Researchers usually put the crystal into cryo EM map and obtain several kinds of data including the quality of fit, the number of noncrystallographyic symmetry atomic and their positions, which are necessary for building the 3D image of the viral protein. By fitting the crystallographic techniques into the lower resolution cryo EM maps of larger assemblies, the accurate of the calibration of electron microscope can be increased. 
	However, some people argue that X-ray crystallography is not a good technology to study virus because of its limitations. Some people state that the X-ray crystallography cannot analyze molecular and atoms that cannot be crystallized. They also point out that the X-ray crystallography could only measure and observe the tertiary structures and quaternary structures of proteins while proteins can consist primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure and quaternary structure. According to the articles I found, although X-ray crystallography is limited when the protein cannot be crystallized, it doesn't mean it can be replaced by other technology. For example, XFEL (X-ray free-electron lasers) is also used to measure protein structure no matter the protein can be crystallized or not. However, The X-ray beams in XFELs are so powerful that they may cause damages on the proteins, which means XFELs actually cannot replace the X-ray crystallography. What's more, because the viral proteins are the keys for virus to infect and reproduce, there is no doubt that the protein structure is very complex to process specific function, it is very rare for that kind of proteins to be made up of primary structure and secondary structure. In other words, most of viral protein are actually composed by complex proteins which are mainly consist of tertiary structure and quaternary structure, it is not necessary to observe and measure the primary structure and secondary structure. 
	In conclusion, according to the article about X-ray crystallography and the interview of the researcher who is studying virus by X-ray crystallography, although some people show opposite opinions, I prove that X-ray crystallography is the best technology to study viral proteins.

"We Want You! To Go to College 
Purdue University 
	Here's the situation: you are a person trying to find a job which will help to support yourself and your family. But how will you distinguish yourself from all the other hundreds of people trying to get the very same job that you want? The answer is simple; the answer is college. Yet so many people decide they don't want to or need to go to college. In this paper I will be discussing the importance of having a college degree because in my research I have found that many people are opting out of attending college. Which is not a good thing, in fact, regardless of how you afford it or what your living situations are like you need to strive as hard as you can to go to college. In order to be more successful, well rounded and sufficiently educated one needs to obtain a college degree. 
	So how does a college degree help you to be more successful? Allow me to explain. Mostly everybody has to have a college degree if they want to get a job that pays well. The minimum wage is $7. 25 in most of the states and there have been many studies that have proven that that is not enough to live on, let alone support a family. All the jobs that pay well require the employee to have some sort of higher education. Well wait a second, you might think, ""well what about factory jobs? Don't those pay well?"". Well yes, factory jobs do pay a fair amount better, but not that much better. Factory jobs are laborious and hard work that pays $11 an hour on average Factory. This isn't that much more money than a fast food restaurant and the type of work is a lot more demanding. So how does one become more successful? Like I said previously, the key to becoming successful is to get a college degree. In this graph from http://www.pewresearch.org illustrates that people make more money depending on what type of degree they obtain, if any. 
In other words, people are significantly more successful when they have a bachelor's degree or even an associates degree. If people want to be more successful than going to college is obviously the way to go. This has been proven consistently since 1965. 
	College makes people more well rounded. In order to discuss this, matter we need to establish the meaning of what being well rounded. Webster's defines being well rounded as, ""including many different things: having a lot of variety."" This can be taken to mean different things, however, I interpret this definition to mean that you have been exposed to many different things and have been changed/influenced by many different things. College is definitely a time of change and a time to experience new things. Which makes it a great time to learn about new things, experience new things and try new things. A lot of people would agree with me on this point. The counter argument to this point is that the price of college isn't worth what you get out of it. Now this is hard to defend because a lot of people have different ideas about what they will take away from college besides the obvious degree. However, there was a study showing that a majority of the people that attend college would consider college to have paid off or will pay off. 
This graph also comes from http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/11/6-key-findings-about-going-to-college/. This graph shows that people were happy with their college experience. So the argument that college is not worth it is invalid. That means that college is a great time to become well rounded and it is worth it. 
	My final argument is the most important reason as to why someone must go to college. That reason is as follows: as the earth we live on becomes more and more advance we need to know more. As a human race we need to be more educated and informed about the world we live in so that we can make well educated decisions. In order to do that we need to get more than a high school education. In other words, we need to go to college. I am not the only one with this view either. Dr. Neil de Grasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist who said in an interview about education that, ""You need to be educated. that's the least you should demand out of yourself"" Tyson. He was talking about college. You need to go to college. This world we live in is a crazy place and it's time we educate ourselves. 
	I have provided sufficient information for the readers to understand that going to college is imperative. Regardless of the price, you need to strive for college and a higher education because college is important for you and our world. In order to be more successful, well rounded and sufficiently educated one needs to obtain a college degree. I cannot stress enough the importance of college and educating yourself. Hopefully with the information provided has been enough to convince you to attend and better yourself and our world.

"Argumentative Essay: The future of Japanese tourism 
On March 11, 2011, there was a 9. 0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that happened in Japan, and lead to the meltdown at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant which caused a dramatic decline in Japanese tourism. However, several points about the future of Japanese tourism seem optimistic. First is governmental supports for Japanese tourism, second is China becoming the fastest growing market, third is upcoming 2020 Summer Olympic Games, and the final one is the registration of Mt Fuji into UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
In 2013, with the economy recovery in Japan, governmental supports improved the current Japanese tourism. Euromonitor International (2014) and Grant (2012)'s reports that Government provides some support for improving Japanese tourism. After that, Japanese tourism began to growing continuously because consumer confidence and recreational activities are improved. What's more, government also offered lower visa requirement for south Asia directly increased the number of international trips to Japan to 10 million in 2013. The increasing number of visitors from Southeast Asia will have an excellent influence on the future of Japanese tourism. 
In addition, although the natural disaster and the nuclear crisis in 2011 caused international tourists not go to Japan, this situation began to change recently because China became the fastest-growing market for Japanese tourism. Euromonitor International (2014) indicates that the weakening Japanese yen attracts a lot of tourists for lower price to travel to Japan, With the help of increasing Chinese tourists, Japanese tourism will recover to their 2010 level in 2014, and they also predicts that the number of arrivals from China, South Korea, and Taiwan in 2014 will be more than that in 2010 and the number of domestic tourism in Japan will rebound to 305 million in 2016. This information directly shows that the future of Japanese tourism is bright. 
Furthermore, Summer Olympic Games and Paralympics in 2020 will be hosted in Tokyo, this global event will attract more tourists from all over the world. Euromonitor International (2014) predicts that hosting such a huge sporting event is also a great opportunity to assist Japan to reach its target of 20 million visitors by 2020 and broaden the international tourism market. The huge amount of visitors will help Japan reborn from the effect of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant and encourage Japanese economic recovery. This upcoming event will provide a huge group of potential customers for Japanese tourism in 2020, it can show that the future of Japanese tourism still have a lot of possibilities. 
Besides, Mt Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013 it attracted more people to come to Japan for this unique Japanese Mountain. Although Mt Fuji has been a world-wide well-known sightseeing place for both international and domestic tourists for a long time, the successful registration of UNESCO World Heritage Site will make more and more visitors come to see and climb the beautiful Japanese Mountain. What's more, there will be more local shops, restaurants and Japanese traditional hotel near Mt Fuji so that it also will encourage the tourism of surrounding towns and cities. This phenomenon shows that there are still a lot of people want to come to Japan because of the beauty and fame of Mt Fuji. 
In conclusion, the future of Japanese tourism will be optimistic. Although Japan faced the meltdown at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. The effect of that is not long-term, Japanese tourism began to get away from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in the recent several years. The continuous growth of Japanese tourism in 2013, upcoming 2020 Summer Olympic Games, China became the fastest-growing market, and the registration of UNESCO World Heritage Site of Mt Fuji which I looked into this paper showed that there are still a huge amount of visitors and potential tourists want to travel to Japan.

"Argumentative Essay Final Draft 
April 3rd, 2016 
""Danger"" of Artificial Intelligence 
In the past two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) is moving very fast that it sometimes even seems magical. Things like self-driving car, personal voice assistant, and all kinds of robots that we ever dreamed of all come true. As we enjoy the convenience AI has brought to us life, some people started to think that AI would threaten human existence like in the science-fiction ""future"" - ""The Terminator"" and ""The Matrix"". In fact, the current AI technologies are still way far from have some kinds of human level AI robots, not even nearly close to any sort of super intelligence that will take over the world. AI robots will threaten existence of humanity is only in our imaginations. 
Not only limited to learn existed human knowledges, AI machines are usually master of only one skill. Wei, an expert in AI at Wicrosoft, mentioned in the interview that Deep Learning is single learning object limited, which means that machines are unable to generalize and learn any information other than their original tasks. 
Compare human to machines, every normal person can draw upon their experiences to make an analyzation in every new situation, and try different ways to find an efficient to move on, but no machines are able to do these. So there is no way for a machine that is only capable of doing what we known and also not capable of doing everything we can to endanger us. 
	Some people would say that even Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates warned about the threat of AI, so they believe their words have to mean some things. And they speculate that AI would not be a threat to us with current technology doesn't mean the ""Terminator"" can't come true in the future. It is undeniably that Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates did warn about AI; however, if we look closely to what Stephen Hawking wrote, there is a precondition towards threat of AI. ""Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history."" Wrote by Stephen Hawking in Independent 201. ""Unfortunately, it might also be the last unless we learn how to avoid the risks."" (Hawking, 2014) So yes, AI could be a big problem unless we can't not control it, but AI machines are built based on what we have known, there should not be a problem of controlling for the things we made ourselves. Also on January 13, 2015, the AI community has signed a letter calling for make AI that helps, rather than destroys, humanity (Clark, 2015). Will a robot only be capable of creating do anything to threaten human society? Absolutely not. It may influence our society, but it won't become a threat. 
One thing AI does will affect human society is that, in the future AI will ""battle"" some job positions with us. (Marcus, 2013) AI robots are more efficient than human while doing some basic things like manufacturing, so when robots replace these positions, many will people lose their jobs. But as robots replace people, there probably will be coming up some new position like robot and machine supervisor that require high skill. So AI give a change for people who get replaced by robot work harder to become the robot supervisor, it's more likely that AI lift them up. 
The relationship between human and machine is partnership that is like the partnership between human and tool. ""The 'tool' will get ever better as they become more intelligent, and we will become better as well."" (Norvig, 2012) Instead of being afraid of AI, we need to learn to better use and control it. In my opinion, AI is like an injection of fresh blood to our world, and it will bring a better tomorrow!

"How Mobile Phones Influence Sleep
	Some people think the mobile phone does not influence people's sleep or not that much, and they always put the cell phone under their pillows or on the bed when they fall asleep. As far as I worked in the English 106I course project ""How Mobile Phones Influence Sleep"", I absolutely consider using the mobile phone before sleeping influence people's sleep negatively. According to Thom e S, H renstam A, & Hagberg M, (2011), Mobile phone use and stress, sleep disturbances, and symptoms of depression among young adults--a prospective cohort study, there is an exact link between mobile phone and quality of sleep from young adults, and mobile phones affect young adults' sleep in a negative way.
	Some people might argue that the size of mobile phones are much smaller compared to other electronic devices, how could they influence people's sleep. Based on the personal interview with Doctor <name> (majored in the medical technology at <place> University, got a master's degree, the chief physician in Neurology Department), firstly, the blue light from the screen of the phone could prohibit the content of the hormone melatonin. The hormone melatonin is a chemical tryptamine which could be increased by people's sleeping and help people fall asleep in an efficient way. Secondly, there is too much information (words, pictures, and other thoughts) input by using the mobile phone, and this information will stimulate in people's brain which is an adverse reaction to sleep well. Thirdly, using the mobile phone before sleeping could form a poorly conditioned reflex with people's sleeping habit and bed.
	Some of us probably will say they feel they do have deep sleep even though they use mobile phones before sleeping, and there are no influences to their bodies caused by the mobile phone. Based on my research, there are some symptoms have already appeared related to this kind of behavior. Fossum I N, Nordnes L T, Storemark S S, Bjorvatn B, & Pallesen S, (2014), argue that firstly, using mobile phones to text, surf, and play before going to the bed could be linked with the relatively late chronotype, which means the delay of biological clock. Secondly, people who have access to the mobile phone will not be energetic in the morning, compared with the people who limits to use the mobile phone. Thirdly, the phase delay of circadian rhythm could be attracted if using the mobile phone excessively before going to sleep. It is not hard to see that using the mobile phone before falling asleep could cause the relatively late chronotype, and if people who use the mobile phone excessively, they will not be energetic on the morning and also may have the phase delay of circadian rhythm, which related to our sleep and caused a negative way in quality of sleep apparently.
	Someone who has the high addiction level of the mobile phone might chuckle because they think the people who have the low addiction level of the mobile phone suffers the same results, which is poor qualitative sleep, as theirs'. I can clearly tell these people they are wrong. There is a detailed research, Sah n S, Ozdemir K, Unsal A, & Temiz N, (2013) focuses on the relationship between the addiction level of the mobile phone and University students' quality of sleep, and states the people who have the higher addiction level of the mobile phone, will have worsened sleep quality. In the research, they evaluate the addiction level of the mobile phone with the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Scale, and evaluate the sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which consists of open-ended question and multiple-choice questions (answer as very good, fairly good, fairly bad, or very bad). The 0 to 3 points will be given based on each question, and the higher scores denote the poorer quality of sleep. The result of the research shows people who have the higher addiction level of the mobile phone, will have worsened sleep quality.
	In conclusion, I would like to tell people that the mobile phone could influence sleep quality, cause some health symptoms, and also the addiction level of the phone has correlation with sleep quality. Furthermore, there are many people noticed that the bad side of the mobile phone caused on their sleep and they did not use their mobile phone before sleeping, in order to have sleep with the good quality. From my perspective, using the mobile phone before sleeping is bad for your sleep.

"Christian Churches Have Positive Influences on Chinese Students 
Argumentative essay 
16 April 2015 
Purdue University 
Abstract 
Many Chinese students are not familiar with Christianity. As a Chinese student interested in Christianity, I had the experience of going to the Greater Lafayette Chinese Alliance church during my first semester at Purdue University. In order to discuss the topic whether Chinese students benefit from Christian churches or not I combined my formal proposal, interview report and my synthesis paper. With the supporting ideas of my interviewee and several scholars, my argument is that since more and more Chinese students choose Christian churches as they study in the U.S.; Christian churches give those non-religious Chinese students positive influences. 
Keywords: Christian churches, benefits, Chinese students, positive. 
Christian Churches Have Positive Influences on Chinese Students 
Introduction 
Being taught materialism in politics classes, many Chinese students have limited knowledge about Christianity. As a freshman of Purdue University, I spent a large amount of time experiencing the bible study and Sunday worship of Greater Lafayette Chinese Alliance church in my first semester. After witnessing the rapid population increase of this Christian community and the significant similarities shared by the members of this Chinese church, I decided to study why Chinese students choose Christian churches when they study in the U.S. and whether churches have positive influences on Chinese students' life. I researched on the significance of high convert rates in Chinese Christian churches and proved that Christian churches benefit Chinese students. 
Methods 
Positive influences of Christian churches 
The fact of history has proved that Christianity has a positive influence on society so that Christians are able to be contributive in various fields. De Mar (2009) supports this idea in his work by giving several examples of great Christians who did outstanding contributions to the world. My interviewee <name> also admitted that her characters were changed after believing in God: ""I felt the deep love from him (the God) so I think I need to share this deep love to others. So I start to feel that I need to help other not because I want something back from them but because the Christ loves me."" 
Since it is clear that Christianity has the power to influence people, it also has a close relationship with international students studying in the U.S. Christian churches are conclusive communities that welcome both domestic and international students. Due to this characteristic, it is common to see international students who are considered as the minorities of the campus grow interest in Christianity and Christian churches. Lacina (2002) states that some students experience loneliness; others may have problems due to their unfamiliarity with U.S. customs and values (p.21). Although schools need to take the role of solving problems for international students, she illustrates that ""There appears to be no greater influence on cultural customs and practices than religion"" (p.23). Christian churches offer a solution to International students facing social problems. Hence, there are specific reasons for Chinese people to choose church communities. 
The article of Yang (1998a) introduces a common characteristic in many Chinese-American churches, that is, a high convert rate among adults. ""Most of them converted to evangelical Protestantism after coming to the United States"" (p.240). The article gives a conclusion that social and cultural changes in China, institutional factors and the universal challenge of modernity have impacted Chinese to become Christian (p. 254). Yang (1998b) in another article, conversion and identity construction: the role of the Chinese Christian church in the USA, also talks about the role of a Chinese church. It is a converting agency: the construction and re-affirming of a meaning system based on Christian faith is most important for the church and the participants. It is an assimilation agency: it is a home for the ""selective assimilation,"" holding traditional moral values but based them on the newly accepted Christian ground. It is also an ethnic center: it not only maintains Chinese identity by network construction, but also transforms the Chinese pride to a Chinese mission which stimulates Chinese Christians to evangelize to other peoples (p.?). 
Answering why Christianity have the attraction to Chinese people, Kuo (2014) indicates that ""Christianity with a Chinese character"" has been created because of the historical transformation of Chinatown and the practical help that the churches have rendered their parishioners in meeting their social and psychological needs. Similarly Wang (2004) presents her idea in her article that social-cultural changes in China prepare PRC students for accepting a religious belief, while the institutional context in the U.S. eventually lead them to becoming evangelical Christians. Chinese evangelical organizations have played a very important role in recruiting Chinese converts. The institutional contexts in the United States make it possible for them to claim a religious belief. The evangelical missionaries provide them a religion that is more acceptable to them (conclusion and implication). 
Conclusion 
Based on my research, Christian churches have the capacity to influence Chinese students. Churches are conclusive communities that offer chances for students to learn about Bible and Christianity. Students can also meet new friends from vast fields and seek for mental supports from seniors and priests in Christian churches. These advantages are attractive to international students, especially Chinese students. As Yang (1998a) points out, the historical and psychological factors both explained Chinese students' conversion to Christianity. For Chinese students, conversion doesn't necessarily mean switching from one religion to another. Students who were non-religious also convert to Christians because of the positive influences of Christian churches. As a result, the population of Chinese Christian churches has increased rapidly for the recent years, which makes the influence more powerful and widespread. Just as <name> said that God helped her to overcome her heavy burdens and to feel relieved and refreshed in social and academic life, I believe that Chinese students benefit from Christian churches after joining the church community.

Appreciation of Chinese Calligraphy Art 
As it is known, art and especially calligraphy art, always conveys the rich history of the culture and culture practice. Meanwhile, as it is also known, the subtlety and the obscurity are wildly served as the uniqueness of Eastern art, and the Chinese calligraphy art falls in not as an exception. However, the question behind raise along with the complicity and the obscurity, does it mean that the Chinese calligraphy art is not a universally appreciable? 
Firstly, calligraphy art is no different from any other sort of art. Appreciating it is to appreciate beauty. Like painting and photographing, not knowing the story behind it maybe a way for one to truly appreciate the patterns and the handwritings. Sometimes the story will get to interfere with one's judgment about the true quality of handwriting it along although the it may indicate the value. When a picture is poorly framed, the fact that it is not a well-taken picture in terms of appreciating photography would not be eliminated by any fancy story behind it. In a nutshell, appreciating Chinese calligraphy is like any other kind of art, a visual feast. Sometimes what we should do in order to really feeling a piece of art is to let go other interferences and be drenched into beauty of itself along. 
Secondly, other culture also enjoyed a complicated form of art as well. Chinese calligraphy art is not the only system that its beauty is attributed of both structures and philosophy. No need to mention the prolonged history of European calligraphy ever since medieval time, the Indi scripts, fascinating Arabic scripts and etc. These cultures are all embedded with astonish calligraphy art, and though it maybe different in ways for every single culture to interpret them, every culture is devoted into appreciating calligraphy. Therefore, I believe, calligraphy as a universally appreciated art itself definitely has some shared impact on various regions and consequently, so does Chinese calligraphy art. 
Thirdly, no one is born to be good at appreciating, even the knowledge about the culture one grown up with himself is acquired by learning. In another way, it's not a matter of the east or the west, it's a matter of getting familiar to the culture. There are countless examples of success in learning a different culture and cultural practices. The easterners are learning the west culture; the westerners learn from the east, people are always learning. Cultural related courses nowadays are wildly provided in colleges and other institutions, it seems to be way easier getting access to practically mundane cultural influences than ever. 
Someone may question that as an alien to a certain cultural group, due to the lack of periodical influences of the completed cultural practices, one may never be as good as a native about cultural matters. Well, it's true that alien may never be as good as natives, but that doesn't seem to be a problem of appreciating. While one appreciating, he is also learning. Whether one reaches a level of natives or not doesn't necessarily interferes with the process of learning. Besides, not reaching a level of natives do not indicate that one can't not appreciate the beauty of it since beauty is fundamentally universal. Others may concern that one might even be quite familiar with certain culture, but the appreciation may be interfered with other different cultural influence that one may carried himself thus misleading the original information that an art work may try to express. This concern is reasonable, yet misunderstands the true meaning of appreciating. There's no so-called original information, anything shown is interpreted, by others or maybe by one oneself. Appreciating is not evaluating. The goal of appreciating is to feel the beauty and the thoughts behind a piece of art work. There's no objective right or wrong about appreciation on a subjective concept - beauty. 
After addressing these statements above has made the point straightly clear - Despite the fact that indeed the differences among cultures exist, Chinese calligraphy art has the universal appreciablility as one of its feature. Its identity as a form of art, calligraphy as shared form in every culture and the access of learning are all factors contribute for it. 
Thus, what we should do in front of a piece of art is to be emerged and let go.

Dude, Where's my essence?
In today's society, the media seems to be everywhere and anywhere one goes. The media tends to get a hold on popular culture and uses those cultural topics to its advantage. One of these popular culture phenomenons is skateboarding. Since the arrival of its popularity in the 1960's, skateboarding has been about the joy of cruising the streets of wherever one is and having a good times with friends. Turn the clock forward to the present day and skateboarding has changed drastically. The media has definitely taken a toll on skateboarding and the way we view it now. If one studied the skateboarding culture in the modern age, they would notice that brand imaging is the heartbeat of the skateboarding industry. The issue with this new found image is that it destroys the beauty of skateboarding as an art-form. What the skateboarding companies are doing now is bowing down to corporations, which they once despised, and letting these large corporation turn these once-modest skateboarding companies into corporate monsters, seeming to lose sight on what really is important about skateboarding and are becoming more concerned on product imaging. While this issue may be terrifying to a true ""skater"", the upside to all of this is that skateboarding is getting recognition. For decades, skateboarders were considered outcasts by the general public. Now, they are respected for their creativity and their skill. Also, the skateboarding companies are gaining profits, which is excellent for the people who run these skateboarding companies.
Skateboarding, like life itself, has a mixed group of people. Skateboarding allows those groups to socialize and skate with one another. ""The styles of expression varied greatly, and the skaters classified each by association with a type of music or style of skating. Some of these included 'hippies', 'punks', 'skinheads',' frat boys', 'metalers' (i.e., those who listened to heavy metal music), 'rappers', and 'old timers' (e.g., those who did slalom skating as opposed to 'trick' skating)"" (Yiannakis 49). These groups of skaters can come together and share their love of skateboarding. As a skater myself, I truly do believe this concept because many of my good friends have been made through skateboarding. If one begins to skateboard, they can take on their own identity. ""Members of the subculture whom I observed used the materials created by the skateboarding industry, but they did so in a manner that did not fully support the industry's goal of mainstreaming ('Little Leaguing') skateboarding. Resistance to bureaucratization was also demonstrated in the structure and values of the subculture"" (Yiannakis 50). This quote states that if one can stay original and true to themselves, they can gain respect by their peers. I agree with this statement because when I purchase a product, I just want to skate it and I do not think much of the brand. People can easily confuse the competitive nature of skateboarding with professional sports. Skateboarding competitions are not made for people to see who is better, It is another chance to associate with other skateboarders. ""Most of those attending the contest were not actually competing but rather participating in the peripheral activities of watching, fraternizing, and skating apart from the contest. These skaters used the contest to meet new people, learn new tricks, and skate on new and challenging courses which they rushed to during the warm-up periods. In addition, many of the contestants were skaters who closely associated with the grassroots form of skateboarding but who defined and used the contest as an opportunity to meet personal needs as opposed to fully adopting the values of the CSA"" (Yiannakis 51). Contests are usually based on an ego one may have, but skateboarding manipulates the contest in a respectable manner. When skaters interact with each other, they have a strong tendency to hold the peace. ""My 2 years of observing skaters interactions confirm these statements. Skaters were very supportive of each other. It was common to see skaters who on their first meeting encouraged each other, gave tips, and laughed at their own mistakes"" (Yiannakis 53). Skaters are very supportive of each other because of their true passion for skateboarding and the willingness to share their knowledge with other people. It is quite simple to see that skateboarding is segregated from domesticated sports. ""The popular practice of skateboarding does not use rules, referees, coaches, or organized contests"" (Yiannakis 54). To further this statement, a female skater by the name of Pamela explains how skateboarding differs from soccer. ""Soccer is a lot of pressure.you have be as good if not better than everybody else, you have to be, otherwise you don't get to play at all. Skating you can't do that. You just have to push yourself harder and harder. Swimming is just sort of there, you get timed, now for me you go against the clock. Now when you skate you don't go against anything, you just skate. That's what it is"" (Yiannakis 54). This quote is a good example of the separation of skateboarding and a domestic sport because of all the rules and the details that hold back the fun of sports. Not only is skateboarding an active hobby, it is also considered an art form. A skater by the name of Doug relates skateboarding and art by saying ""A lot of them [skaters] are really involved with artistic endeavors, are very artistic. You can see the parallel; it's kind of a freedom of expression that skating is. How do you express yourself by playing football, playing basketball? When you're skating it's, basically skating reflects your mood at the time and how you're skating, what you are doing, you know, it's definitely, you know, a way to express yourself"" (Yiannakis 55). I agree with this quote because I can relate to not being able to be myself when I played a sport like hockey or baseball, which leads me to try skateboarding, in turn finding one of my true passions. By keeping the creative and individual spirit of skateboarding alive, finding social satisfaction and earning respect from others (i.e. fellow skaters), is inevitable.
Even though there are vast benefits to skateboarding, there are also downsides. Anyone who is familiar with skateboarding can tie in the likeliness of injuries happening. ""In the south-west the producer of 'Westward Report' found 100 recorded skateboard injuries during October, almost entirely among the 5-15 age group- the surfers who take up skateboarding in the winter are more expert and wear more protective clothing than the youngsters"" (Jefferiss 1349). The same source also emphasizes on the fact that ""For all sports injuries our incidence of fractures is 14.8"", but for skateboarding injuries it is 22.6"""" (Wilson 1349). Danger is undeniable when riding a skateboard without caution. A second example of the downside of skateboarding is the prominent disapproval of government officials. Love Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a highly recognized urban skateboarding spot and believed that plenty of skateboarding history happened there. Despite the history made there, government officials deny the importance of Love Park and have taken on the initiative of making sure skateboarding is discouraged there. ""Even so, Mayor John Street's administration had the plaza redesigned at public expense in order to deter skateboarders"" (Howell 2). One would consider this unfair in two respects. One is that the administration is redesigning the park, which ruins the preservation aspect of the park and the other respect is that the administration is using taxpayer money to abash skateboarders skateboarding there, who have the right to do so. With all these negative aspects in skateboarding, one could be scared of skateboarding to begin with, but one must also be very cautious when skateboarding at all times.
In the world of skateboarding, corporate America and the media are an unwelcomed mix. Corporations across the globe are constantly attempting to get a hold on the skateboarding culture. Sadly, the corporations do not use skateboarding in a considerate fashion. Instead, the primary focus of corporations involved in skateboarding is simply to make profit and nothing more. ""Our purchase of CCS was a significant step in capitalizing on this opportunity. Our fourth quarter profit from CCS was in line with our expectations.CCS has the opportunity to generate double digit operating profit margins during 2009, in line with those of Footlocker.com"" (Chapman). This quote was said by Matthew Serra, CEO of Foot Locker. CCS is a worldwide supplier of skateboarding products accessible by catalog or via internet. CCS has earned respect from the skateboarders who purchase products from them because of their care of customers and reasonable prices. It is upsetting to see that such a company has fallen victim to corporate America. The silver lining of this situation is that products from CCS are much more accessible to skaters if ordering products through the catalog or the internet is not an option. In a professional business mindset, small skateboarding companies are not the wisest investments. ""There are plenty of skater-owned skate companies that regularly make decisions that can only be thought of as foolish from a business perspective, decisions that are seriously irrational, deeply inefficient. To hell with efficiency and rationality. Unfortunately, sound business decisions and personal convictions are often incompatible. When there's some conflict between the two, you have to make a choice, and I think it's reasonable to fear that non-skate corporations will go for the rational, efficient business decision, because business is their only interest in skateboarding to start with-they have no personal conviction about skateboarding"" (Transworld Skateboarding). While it is true that small skateboarding companies are bound to fall by the wayside, especially in today's economy, It is small skateboarding companies that people do appreciate because of their dedication to skateboarding and their genuine desire to make skateboarding products. If one imagines, small skateboarding companies in the skateboarding industry can be compared to small businesses to the global economy, in the essence that they are the foundation of their market. Purchasing a skateboarding company is one small step for these corporations to do in order to make a profit without taking consideration of the skateboarding aficionado. ""This event was of course televised, so corporations were very much in the house. There were numerous banners all over the course promoting every sort of product you could think of. And even though there were banners displayed throughout the contest area, I noticed that there was not a single one for any skateboard company-which got me thinking we were basically out of what should be our element and sort of selling our souls for the deliciously decadent dollar without clearly being conscious of it"" (Transworld Skateboarding). To have these corporations being promoted and not having the courtesy to put up a banner of recognition for the skateboarding companies is ridiculous, which would be like putting a Chrysler ad in a Cat Fancy magazine. Skateboarding magazines and contests should be hobby-specific and should not be interfered with by irrelative products or companies.
Being that this event was televised leads skateboarding into the idea that skateboarding lifestyles should be portrayed on television. This idea caught on with people at MTV, which produced two shows called Viva La Bam and Life of Ryan. Viva La Bam is a show that portrays the daily life and antics of skateboarding professional Bam Margera. The show generally displays Margera doing wild stunts and making a ruckus at his local home with his parents and uncle. Occasionally, it will show Margera and his friends skateboarding, but not actually documenting the life as a skateboarder. The show distorts the image of Margera because he is a talented skateboarder and should be recognized as so, not through out of control stunts and unruly behavior. Life of Ryan is another show that mainly focuses on Ryan Sheckler and his life as a professional skateboarder such as showing all the details of his competitions and his life at home with his family and friends. Despite this show being more skateboarding specific, the status that Sheckler has reached is more of a superstar quality than a skateboarder. What these two shows have in common is that their money-making machines not only to the producers who produces them, but to the corporations that they are sponsored by make large amounts of money just because the people on these shows wear their clothes with their logo on it every time the camera is pointed at them. For corporations this is product placement at its finest and propaganda taken to an extreme.
There are many companies outside of the skateboarding world who make an effort to enter the market of skateboarding to give their company an image boost. One of the main companies to do so is Nike. Nike is a worldwide manufacturer of sporting goods of all sorts such as helmets, apparel, gloves, shoes, etc. One of their most recent business ventures was to enter the skateboarding market. To this day, they are very successful, mainly because their Nike SB Dunk shoes, which have been released in a near-endless variety of color combinations and special editions, have become a instant sensation with sneaker aficionados. When Nike first entered into the skateboarding market, the reaction was simple: skaters did not approve. ""One day, Nike had decided to sell special shoes for skateboarders. But there was a problem. Not the obvious problem of whether or not skateboarders actually required special shoes but the problem of skater resistance. As Kelly Evans-Pfeifer of the Goodby, Silverstein agency spun the tale, the problem when Nike 'decided to get into the skateboarding market' was that 'skateboarders did not want them there.' Skateboarding, it turned out, was 'an alternative culture' populated with difficult people who 'don't really like this attention they're getting from mainstream companies'"" (Heller 203). Nike overcame this hurdle with some respect because of their ability to make shoes. I find that when this quote referred to the skateboarding culture as difficult people made me mad because skateboarders just want things a certain way without asking too much and it seems that when Nike entered the business of selling skateboarding products, they expected to be welcomed, but they were not.
In conclusion, the business world of skateboarding is just as dangerous as the skateboard itself. The corporations that are buying up these skateboarding companies are not giving any consideration of the true skateboarders that are buying their products. In the previous paragraph, the recognition that Nike has gained from the skateboarding world is a small victory at best, being known as a company that sells a poor performing shoe that comes in all colors of the rainbow to satisfy a sneaker freak. But do not be alarmed by this onslaught of negativity. Die-hard skateboarders of all kinds of backgrounds are still keeping the individual spirit alive by making new friends while sharing and laughing about skateboarding. It is typically of today's skateboarders to be caught up in the hype of the skateboarding fashion and lose focus on the skateboarding itself. If one truly found the beauty and the art of skateboarding and embraced it, they would see how great skateboarding is. The skateboarding culture can holds itself without help from the media or giant corporations.

Physical and Health Course for first year college students 
The freshman 15 is the title that was given to the weight gain of many first year college students. Some of the causes include bad eating habits, lack of exercise and alcohol consumption. The weight gain can lead not only to physical health problem, social and academic deficiency ate also effects caused by this issue. To prevent the freshmen 15 and the effects, especially those that interfere with school, colleges and universities should require their first year students to take a physical and health education class. Although many may argue that these kinds of courses are a waste of time that could be used for more academic courses like math or science, it is important to dedicate time to prevent issues that will affect academic achievement. 
By providing an education on good nutrition habits, which is the main cause of the freshman 15, students would learn how to choose foods that are healthy for them an do not lead to weight gain. In addition, by having a balanced diet student will be able to perform better in college. According to Larissa Hirsch (2014), the freshman 15 can have negative effects on academic life because students experience a decrease of energy, attention, and concentration ability. Helping in the prevention of the freshmen 15 would also mean that diseases that can be caused by it, which Hirsch states include diabetes and obesity, would also be prevented. 
This course would also implement a required amount of hours in which the student has to participate in some form of physical activity. During college, many students do not make time for exercise and therefore they are just consuming calories but not burning them. This leads to weight gain. Evidence also suggests that exercise helps academic performance. For example, at Purdue University "" more than 1,820 students who visit Purdue France A. C rdova Recreational Sports Center at least 16 times a month earned a GPA of 3. 0 or higher"" (Neubert, 2013, p. 1). Based on this statement, exercise and good grades are positively correlated. 
Another factor that has an influence on weight gain is alcohol. Many college students become social drinkers or even stress drinkers. Alcohol and drug abuse is also one of the main causes of death, assaults, sexual abuse and injuries in many college campuses (""College Drinking,"" n.d.). It also interferes with academic life. According to the National Institution of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, one quarter of students have reported that their bad academic standings are due to alcohol abuse. Therefore teaching students about ""healthy"" alcohol consumption is an important topic that could be addressed in the course. 
All in all, there is a necessity of implementing a seminar and practical health course in universities in order to decrease the number of students gaining the freshman 15 and improving academic success rates. A course like this not only helps the student during college, but also in their future. The topic of the freshman 15 goes beyond the superficial physical effects. Bad habits that are not corrected early in time become difficult to eliminate later on. A student may start with 15 more pounds in college, and continue to gain weight consistently after graduation. This gives pathway to lethal conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes or obesity. This is why the earlier people get educated on how to practice a healthy life style; the less people will encounter these obstacles in their lifespan.

"P5D1 Can computer games be a hobby of children in school?

Can computer games be a hobby of children in school? 
	When I was young, my mother allowed me to play computer games only half an hour on weekends. Everything has relationships with computer games are seemed ""evil"" by parents and teachers. However, children who like playing computer games have no differences with some children like playing basketball. I think computer games should be accepted by schools as a kind of hobby of children. 
	Different children have different hobbies in school, most hobbies are appreciated by parents and teachers. If a children can draw a very beautiful picture, the teacher will consider him/her owning ""deft hands"". Nevertheless, if any child is known as good at playing computer games, he/she will be considered as ""addict"". It's really unfair, playing well on computer games need much more effort and skill than draw a simple picture. In a research paper called ""Testing E-sports athletes: A study on competitive gaming"" (2014) of Alexander Ferm and Simon Galle, who are experts of The Swedish School of Sports. They indicated that players of E-sports need a fast reaction speed, so they can react to any changes or orders given by their teammates in game, they also need a sensitive brain to think up for strategies, a good strategy can be an essential element of winning a game with enemies who have similar strength. (P5-P6) So children who can play computer games well should be good at reasoning and analyzing. Thus, why not throw stereotype away, give these children encourages? 
	Gaming can combine with educational things. For example, students in engineering major can play a kind of game which requires players to design vehicles which can pass complex obstacles and attacking of enemies. This game is actually a homework for engineering students to train their ability of imagination and designing, and students feel very glade to spend hours to pass the game. If the homework is multiple choice or analyzing, students must freak out if the homework take hours to finish. The fact is that homework in style of gaming can attract students to do it. I played a lot of games in back ground of ancient China and the World War II when I was young, so I could recall many events happened at those time periods, so I spend easy times in secondary school in history class. Combining academic things with computer games should be more effective in primary education, because children are easier to be attracted by things they are interested in. If teachers can perfectly mix class with something from computer games, children will be more willing to go for classes, so more children who do not do well in school because of they are not interested in classes will be more concentrated in their classes. 
	Gaming can train children's ability of designing and thinking, and it may be helpful in teaching, but people may think the harmfulness is larger than the benefit. The most thing people worry about is that computer games are addiction, some people believe that most children will get in addict if they touch computer games, if children get in addict, they will not be able to control themselves to spend more time on games; many children in deep addiction will escape from their schools for gaming. However, it's a good chance to train children's ability of controlling themselves. If parents and teachers can spend a little time taking care of the attitude games, they can stop children from getting in addict at the first time. Schools can give lessons of self-control. Although children are too young to understand any big principles, they know what is beneficial for them and what is harmful. So preventing children from addiction is not a very hard thing. 
	As a conclusion, computer game can be a very good hobby for children in school. Playing computer games in adapted time can improve the alacrity of brain and give children more chance to practice their imagination. I hope parents and teachers can look at computer games in another aspect and accept computer game as a kind of healthy hobby.

Discovering a New Area for an Advancement 
	Although American agriculture industry is at the top notch in the global food market, there are still many areas that can be developed. One aspect that could improve American agriculture industry is diversity. The United States agriculture industry should pay more attention to hiring international agriculture business applicants because international employees can set themselves special in terms showing an outstanding performance in international trade based on bilingualism, unique agricultural sales perspective, and knowledge of unintroduced agricultural products. 
	International agriculture business employees can bring in special qualities that are developed from experiencing two different cultures such as bilingualism and unique perspectives with different vision; such aspects may result in a better performance during international trade than domestic employees. Since international trade is common nowadays in the global market, being bilingual with a diverse background will significantly help the business. In their peer-reviewed article, Chang et al. (2013) emphasize how even students acknowledge the importance of having an experience of studying abroad. International students already have what most domestic students need; according to <name> (2015), considering the fact that international students in America are already from different culture, it is easy to assume that they are bilingual (or multilingual) and aware of concepts of diversity. In addition, apart from <name>'s statement, coming from a different environment, international students are likely to have unique perspectives that are developed from different environment. Such unique perspectives give better understanding of different culture and may lead to a different approach in agriculture business. For example, it would be more necessary to have someone who is aware of two or more nations' cultures instead of one during an international trade; international business does not just get done from communicating in the same language, but rather from understanding cultural difference. Understanding local environment, tradition, culture, and technology is significant during the process of international trade. 
	There are unique agricultural and sales perspectives that can only be attained from international employees. If a company desires to participate in the global market to contribute in American agriculture industry's advancement, the unique perspectives of international employees are required. Each country has different soil and weather. It is crucial to acknowledge acidity and moisture of soil along with the characteristics of each season throughout the year to successfully define what product a country has and what product that country needs. For example, according to K4E Editor (2013), South Korea has four distinct seasons with a wide daily temperature range. Therefore, the climate in South Korea leaves fixed list of imported products. An agricultural company must recognize such aspects and have a sales plan based on those aspects. An American (who is not a local at the branch location) can analyze the climate condition and predict how climate and plans should be adjusted. However, it is limited to the locals to determine special products that can only be cultivated at certain locations with efficiency. Also, there are certain agricultural products that can only be produced at certain location by law. It is more efficient to hire an international employee who is aware of a country's legal matters, climate condition, local market, and culture at the same time when doing an international trade. 
	An international employee expertised in agriculture business can bring a great accomplishment to his company by introducing new products to the market. Just as each country has different climate and soil characteristics, there are certain agricultural products that can only be cultivated in particular countries. There are many unique agricultural products. However, there is a very limited number of people who are experts in agriculture business coming from two or more cultural backgrounds while being familiar with both countries' agriculture industry. Nonetheless, if some of these products can be introduced, it may bring a sensation to the global food market. For example, persimmon is a very common fruit in some Asian countries. It can be eaten raw, dried, or fermented, and it is a very popular fall fruit in Korea and Japan. During the Korean thanksgivings week, it is easy to observe the popularity of persimmon since it is omnipresent at houses and restaurants. If persimmon can be introduced to the global food market by an agricultural company with huge size, it could possibly be sensational. Nevertheless, a domestic employee in the American agriculture industry would definitely be short in knowledge related to this matter. If American agricultural companies that hold majority of world's food production become more active on hiring international applicants, such products can be introduced to the global food market and enhance diversity of agricultural products. 
	International agriculture business employees in the United States can develop America's agriculture industry by bringing unique qualities and benefits that most domestic employees cannot bring. Majority of international agriculture business employees are already prepared to be a part in conducting international trade because they are bilingual, well-aware of different culture, and knowledgeable of agricultural products that are not well-known in the global food market; among the three aspects stated, most domestic employees can barely fulfill one aspect of being bilingual. Although <name> (2015) stated, ""A lot of companies will be looking for recruitment at Purdue and are usually satisfied hiring someone without taking an extra step that takes to hire an international student,"" it is time for those companies that want to contribute in developing American and global agriculture industry to take a step and give more efforts on hiring talented international agriculture employees who can bring advancement because the development of a certain nation's agriculture industry will improve the global food market in general, and will enhance the overall quality of agriculture products.

Accounting Diversity in the Workplace 
With the trend of globalization, more qualified international accountants are needed to earn Chinese companies more opportunities in the competitive global market. According to Reuters (Michelle, 2015), at least five million professional accountants familiar with international markets are needed to help China develop markets and expand business outside Asia. In this case, the prosperous job market in China is expected to attract more international accounting students. However, considering the diversity of accounting education systems, people doubt if international accountants are qualified in Chinese accounting systems. Based on researches and the interview I have done for this project, I believe that discrepancies between different accounting systems will not be a heavy burden for international employees. 
Education backgrounds of international employees make people doubt their qualifications for being professionals in Chinese accounting system. Since accounting education in different countries is based on different accounting systems, people claim that international employees may be unfamiliar with Chinese accounting system. Therefore, discrepancies between Chinese and American accounting systems will make them confused and give rise to their bad performance in careers. However, based on my interview with <name> , a professional in American accounting system, I learned that accounting diversity will not cause serious problems to international accountants. Based on her experiences in Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG), the only problem that accounting diversity caused was the slightly different definitions of technical terms in different systems. Through more understanding of local accounting system and making early preparations for careers, international employees can actually fix this problem and adapt to the local accounting environment easily. 
Another experience of <name> also proves the point that discrepancies between accounting systems are not factors that adversely influence developments of international employees in the workplace. When she entered the work place, she found that the accounting rules are even different between companies. When the audit group receives a case, the first step is to meet clients and to clearly understand their specific requirement for procedures. The work of auditors changes with requirements and needs of their clients. Therefore, she believed that since the accepting different accounting rules is an essential part of daily work of accountants, the differences between accounting systems should be acceptable and would not trap international employees from pursuing success in accounting. When international students have a comprehensive understanding of new accounting systems they will be exposed to, accounting diversity will not cause trouble. 
As is illustrated above, the diversity of both accounting and accounting education systems should not be regarded as heavy burdens for international employees. In fact, some specific differences make international employees more competitive in the area than local employees. According to Career Explorer (n.d.), teamwork is highly valued in accounting. Considering that accounting principles and knowledge update frequently and are really complex, it is fairly important for accountants to work as teams and to share useful information with each other. Thus, interaction skills can be really important for accountants to work effective in the workplace. Based on <name> experiences in American graduate program, she found that the most important thing she learned is the interaction skills. When she was a graduate student in <university> , she was exposed to various opportunities to work and to talk with others, ranging from talking to recruiters in career fairs to doing case analyses with MBA students during management classes. By contrast, she also mentioned that in some Asian countries, students don't have many opportunities to engage in classes and socialize with others, leading to their having few opportunities to practice interaction skills. Consequently, Asian students who work in their own countries after graduating from American university may have better interaction skills and play a more active role in the group work than local employees. 
To conclude, as accepting different accounting rules and keeping track of new trends are essential parts of daily work of accountants, accounting diversity will not cause great troubles to excellent accountants on their way to become professions in accounting systems they are exposed to.

"Black Hole at the Center of our the Milky Way and its Role in our Galaxy Formation 
Introduction 
The universe in which we reside continues to surprise us. As we improve our technological abilities and develop better tools for exploration, we are learning more about how the universe began and all the phenomena that surround us. One such phenomenon happens to be right in our backyard, a supermassive black hole (also called Sgr A*) located at the center of our galaxy. Supermassive black holes are usually highly active and take in matter at a very quick rate, which has been observed in case of several active supermassive black holes. Hence some people claim that the same may be the case with our galaxy and that we may end up as dinner for the black hole. This, however, is not true because of three reasons. Sgr A* is extremely inactive, it belongs to the RIAF model of black holes and from observation we know that the Milky Way galaxy is in a stable state and is not collapsing. Due to these three reasons it is safe to say that we will not end up as dinner for the black hole in the near future. 
Reasons 
Firstly, it is important to recognize the fact that Sgr A* is a supermassive black hole in a near-dormant state. It hardly ever takes in any matter and just acts like a celestial body with gravitational force. 
Moreover, Sgr A* is of the Radially Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) model. Thus a major part of the matter that enters the accretion disk of the black hole eventually never falls into the black hole, rather gets ejected out as energy. 
Finally, detailed study show that our galaxy is highly active but stable. The black hole plays a role in this stable state by holding together the matter in our galaxy. It is highly unlikely that the black hole will destabilize that galaxy or that we will spiral down into the black hole.

"The Questionable Efficacy of Standardized Testing 
	Standardized testing refers to any form of testing that is administrated and graded in a consistent way, intended to measure the achievement of students objectively. One of the most common examples of standardized tests is the college entrance exam, such as Gaokao in China, and the SAT and ACT in the United States. Although the use of standardized testing is very popular in many countries, the efficacy of standardized testing has been debatable. Many people believe that standardized testing is ineffective measure of academic achievements, being a waste of money and resources. 
	Firstly, standardized testing fails to reflect the knowledge, skills or abilities that students have acquired. The common standardized tests that we know, whether state-funded exams like the PARCC test or commercial exams like the SAT, are mainly made up of multiple choice questions (""Multiple-Choice Tests"", 2007). While doing multiple choice questions, students have to pick the best answer from four or five given selections. They do not have freedom to generate an answer nor justify their choice. It is clear that they have to think, calculate, or link to existing knowledge to figure out the right answer; however, the abilities to conduct other kinds of cognitive operations such as sorting out information and reflecting on given information are not evaluated (Kohn, 1999, p. 84). Usually, there is only a small portion or none of exams containing free response questions in standardized tests. Unfortunately, these free response questions also have limitations. They are graded by graders with given rubrics or grading guidelines, which could be biased and less effective, comparing to grade scan sheets by machines (""Hidden Curriculum"", 2014). 
Some people may claim that standardized testing does evaluate the critical thinking and mathematical skills objectively. While in fact, the evaluation was superficial. According to Alfie Kohn, an American lecturer and author that has expertise in education, there is a correlation between high standardized test scores and relatively shallow thinking. Under time pressure, students use shortcuts to eliminate the wrong answers and attempt to get the right answer as quickly as possible without actually thinking about how to solve the problem, or understand the given article thoroughly (Harris, Harris & Smith, 2012). Unfortunately, these behaviors are encouraged and rewarded by standardized testing. 
	Secondly, standard testing is not as objective as the proponents of standardized testing claim to be. Equivalent content does not automatically equal to a fair test. There are factors that might undermine the objectivity of standardized testing. For example, test takers might have different ways of thinking due to different cultural backgrounds. However, agencies like College Board that make the tests are still in the process of taking consideration of culture differences. Students from countries outside the U.S. might not be able to score as well as American students on exams like the SAT. From another perspective, cultural bias also results in hypercorrection. Sonia Sotamayor, who is the first Latina Supreme Court Judge, acknowledged that the cultural bias was ""built into testing"", and considered herself as ""a product of affirmative action"". She got lower standardized test scores then many of her classmates, but was still admitted into Yale and Princeton due to her ethnicity, since Hispanics has been considered unprivileged in education (Savage, 2009). Such cases showed that standardized testing cannot be used as an objective evaluation benchmark for students. 
	Thirdly, standardized testing is extremely costly for both the public and the students, and the efficacy of standardized testing is not worth the high price. According to the research conducted by Matthew M. Chingos, a Senior Fellow at the Urban Institute that specializes in education, 45 states in total spend about $669 million annually on testing (Chingos, 2012). Undoubtedly, the money must come from tax payers. The public is paying a really high price for testing the achievements of students, which is still a debatable statement. Moreover, standardized tests such as ACT and SAT have become an expense for many high school students. An economist, Richard Phelps, believes that standardized testing is cost-effective, claiming that prices charged for commercial standardized tests like the SAT, ACT and AP are ""ranging from $20 to $70 per student"". In fact, the price of one AP exam might exceed 100 dollars since the assigned schools that host the exams have the say in price, speaking from personal experiences. 
Despite that, Phelps forgets to consider the humanity part of standardized testing. Many students would take the SAT or ACT several times to boost their scores. It is also common that high school students would take both the SAT and ACT to see which one is the better fit. Furthermore, multiple AP tests and SAT subject tests are necessary for students to take because some colleges require these scores as well as the SAT or ACT. Thus, some students might have to spend several hundred dollars on numerous standardized tests in order to be a qualified candidate for the universities of their choice. Also, the education experience of students is condensed to series of tests that evaluate their ability to select one answer from given selections, with much less emphasis on evaluating about extended thinking. Standardized testing is not worth this high cost. 
	Overall, the standardized testing has more disadvantages than advantages. The concept itself is deficient or not able to be testified properly. Even though the name suggests fairness, standardized testing is often unfair and biased towards certain groups of individuals. These students might not get the opportunities that others would get and their rights are being jeopardized. In addition, the cost of standardized testing is huge, not only for the states, but also for students. It is not worthy to have such expense because of standardized testing.

"P5D3 Why choose computer science as major 
April 26, 2015 
Why choose computer science as major 
Nowadays, more and more people choose computer science as their major. There are two reasons for this decision. First, computer science is very easy to find a job. Second, students who graduate from this major get very high salary. Those two reasons may sound a little bit material, but those are two important factors when students choose a major. However, some people think that computer science only suit a few people. From my perspective, computer science is a very wide range. People can lots of things in this major. People should not be intimidated by computer science because it is difficult for most people to learn. 
One of reasons that people think computer science not suitable for most people is that computer science is too hard to learn. Most students won't even pass first professional class in computer science major, which suppose to be the easiest class in computer science major. Some people may say that passing rate of computer science is way lower than physics or most of engineering classes. However, people did not realize that computer science like a language. Students need time to get used to it, which explain why most students failed first computer science course. Students need to learn and memorize syntax and grammar of computer science language. Once students get hold of syntax and grammar, they can improve their coding ability rapidly by practicing lots of small program. Therefore, computer science is easier than other subject since students never learn computer language before, but they can master it in a year. Unlike computer science, students already learned other subject such as math, chemistry or physics for lots of years. Of course, algorithm is also very important. Unlike human language, computer language requires different logic to implement program. However, algorithm is based on abundant programming experience. Therefore, students should focus on grammar and syntax instead of algorithm at beginning, so they can have a solid foundation when they continue pursuing this major. Once students get used to the syntax, they will find that programming is not as scary as they thought. 
Another reason people believe that computer science is for small amount people is people would under lots of pressure if they work in IT industry. For example, students who chose security track, which is write application for bank or some high-classified organization. They need to make sure that no one can hack their program, which means their program cannot have one single bug in it. Those people are taking a risk that they may get fired because they made a minor mistake in their program. However, every job has its risk. This is not success if people don't take chance. It may seem too rigorous for those programmers, but it is their responsibility to make their program perfect. Also, there are plenty choices for students from computer science. Students can either choose software engineering or web design, which require less immediate security check. All in all, no matter what job people work on, they should have work ethic. Furthermore, people who work hard and dedicate to produce a perfect program usually get promoted, so they do not need to program or do research anymore. In the opposite, people who always worried about their job and do not know how to handle those pressure usually replaced by younger and better programmers. ""After ten years programming,"" <name> added, ""if programmer does not promote, younger one will replace him."" (<name>, 2015) 
Computer science is a promising major. If students can keep calm and dedicate to it, they will get reward. (Patel, 2011) Also, software engineering has highest average salary among all technology jobs, which is around 63, 000 per year. Furthermore, according to guidance website Career Cast, as author mentioned, 'software engineering is best job of 2011.' (Patel, 2011) There is nothing in the world can be defined as too hard for people to learn. People create this major, so it means fair amount of students can and have ability to learn it. Any occupation is hard if people want to do their best. Computer science is hard to learn if people do not have programming background, but it does not mean it is too hard for people to learn it. As long as students strive for it, they will have a promising future. Mr. Zou said, ""The most popular tracks among all are software engineering, security and web application."" (<name>, 2015) All in all, people should choose computer science major not only because it pays well, but also because it is manageable. In my opinion, if students can conquer basic knowledge and get used to the syntax, they will find that programming is a very interesting thing to do. I can indulge myself in programming without any worries. Therefore, people who think computer science only suit for small amount of people do have understood this major well enough.

"A burning issue: Improving Chinese educational system 
With the economical development, educational problem is still a big issue in human's life. Now I am an international student in Purdue university. Compare to western country, Chinese educational system leave much to be desired. In my mind, the Chinese education Bureau should evaluate students through some outdoor activities, handwork and personal ability except score.
First of all, score is an only way used to measure the goodness of students in China. Every Chinese students have been taught good study is the path to success. Due to get into best school, every student put their all effort into study. For example, the college entrance examination is the biggest exam for high school in China. Good score is seen as a must entry into a good university in the stressful race. Under fierce competition, Chinese students believe that practice makes perfect, students spend a lot of free time on extra problems. It will have a very detrimental effect on student's physical and mental health.
Additionally, the education method in China causes stuednts loss the creativity and innovative during the study. Yong lei ming who write an article ""The difference between Chinese and western Education system"", exampling an exchange teacher educate in China. The exchange teacher assigned an assignment "" Happy festival"" to her students. All students draw the same Christmas tree that imitate the picture on the wall. After she covered the wall painting, students could not draw anything about "" happy festival"". Through the examples from Chinese students, the author concerns that Chinese education pay more attention to the student's teaching and neglect the cultivation of creativity ability. Which company need a study machine work for them? In the modern society, people who coexist of knowledgeable and originality ability is the company really want.
Also, the education level is differentiated by regions in China. Compare to city, people cannot receive good education in poor area. Although government encourage people to become a volunteer teacher in rural area, the scarcity of education resources is still big problem to country student. Moreover, College entrance test is differentiated by cities. High school students will receive different exams from all parts of country. Education Bureau cannot ensure the fairness of test from various examination paper. Also different education level students across the country assemble in the same school, college cannot assure all freshman adapt academic pressure in new school. Unified test paper is the greatest choice for every students enter into the fitness school.
Some people views on make the improvement to Chinese educational system are wrong. One professor said that the exam evaluation is the best way in China because there are too much people in China. Compare to American, Chinese students at ten times number. Through the exam evaluation, it will reduce some unnecessary problems. some professor added that the score of exam is more directly reflect the student's learning ability than other way. Sometimes learning ability will greatly determine student's future success. It can be explain why Chinese education do not need to change at present.
Furthermore, people concurs that exam evaluation is a traditional in Chinese history. Trace back to two thousand years ago, Sui dynasty initiate imperial examination system. Today's college entrance examination is the improvement of imperial examination system, From so much instances during two thousand years, college entrance examination is still the optimum choice to select talents among the country. The professor <name> <name> mentions that the Chinese educational system will activate student's interest to study. Face the fierce competition, Chinese students exert all their energies into study. Therefore, the knowledge they learned will become deep memory.
According to ideas in the above paragraphs, it is a long way to make improvement on Chinese educational system. Firstly we should solve the education level differentiated by regions. Then we should cultivate student's creativity and innovative.

"The comparison of acupuncture for obesity and doing aerobic exercise for obesity 
Purdue University 
04/22/15 
Introduction 
Two thousands year ago, Chinese doctors found that there are a lot of ""magic points"" in human body.( George L.T., 2015) Stimulating these magic points can influence different human body functions. Chinese doctors called this method acupuncture, and these magic points acupoints. There are plenty of alternative hospitals around the world that provide acupuncture treatment. Additionally, more and more people believe in the good effects of acupuncture treatment, and they are choosing alternative medicine instead of modern medicine and general surgery. My research topic was about if acupuncture has more effective on obesity than doing exercise. However, after I did a lot of research online, I have a doubt about the real effects of acupuncture because acupuncture doctors would like to give treatments for patients' lifestyles also, which might do good influence on the body. I think acupuncture is more like a placebo and short-acting painkiller for patients. 
Finding 
Acupuncture is not only famous in China, but also popular all over the world now, such as England, Korea and Japan. I can not say that acupuncture has no effect at all, but I doubt that if it can make big influence on human body. There is some research showing that acupuncture can remit the pain of patients. ( Paul Ingraham,2009) When the doctor stimulates some of the acupoints on the body, patients feel more relax than before. Also, acupuncture is more likely to play a psychological factor for human beings. A doctor from university of south Hapton chose several patients who had chronic cough and divided them into 2 groups. He told both groups that he gave the right and same acupuncture treatment, but he actually only gave one of the groups the right treatment. After four stages of treatment, there was no big differences between two groups of patients, most of them in both groups felt better then before. (University of South Hampton, 2015) Giving one more example, for a patient who has lower back pain, this patient believed in the effect of his acupuncture treatment and thought that he is getting better than before. However, he still had back surgery after three years acupuncture treatment because his body did not really recovered.(George L. T, 2015) 
On the contrary, we can not exactly say that acupuncture has no effect because there is no research shows the evidence accurately. However, some doctors still believe that acupuncture is a potential medical treatment for people.(J.M. Lacey, 2003) In a fat loss research, the patients who got the acupuncture treatment lost 4.7% of their body wight, which is more than the patients who did not accept the treatment. The common problem for the research is that no one can control all the effective factors such as lifestyle and diet one hundred percent. Modern medicine has not shown that they have enough interest in acupuncture, so that may be the reason why we cannot have a totally precise research about acupuncture. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, I think that acupuncture is more like a placebo than a medical method for patients. However, I can not say it has no effect because there is no evidence about it until now. I hope that one day, researchers can find a way to control all the possible factors and prove the effect of acupuncture. I would like to choose many groups of people and control their lifestyle individually. Finally, figuring out if acupuncture is useful or not. However, that would be a long way to go.

Stock trading 
	As time is passing by, the world economy has been facing lots of financial crisis, such as subprime mortgage loan and economic crisis in Greece. A number of people who have witnessed those crisis are worried that financial crisis will be happen again someday. They are trying to save and invest their capital to increase property, simply for their future. For that reason, most of them put their money into stock trading. While a lot of people think stock trading is not a good investing way to increase asset because of the high possibility of losing cash, I believe stock trading is a good method to create benefits. Therefore, I suggest to invest stock. 
	The first reason why I think investing stock trading is good method is that people can control risks of stock trading. They can choose low risks and low profits stock items or high risks and high profits items. If stockholders put their money into low risks and low benefits stock items, they would not experience high risks and lose their assets. For example, I have also been investing money into stock trading since I was a middle school student. When I started to invest stock, I invested the capital in short-terms for few seconds or few minutes for money. However, more I tried to make money, either I lost more money or missed the chance to sell my stocks. As I grew up, I realized that I should not be too greedy, since stock trading is not like a lottery. In addition, it required some efforts from me. Since then, I have been investing money in long-term stock items, which have low risks and low benefits, and I have been making some benefits. Moreover, Laura Shin who is a writer of ""7 Steps To Stock Investing Without Too Much Risk"" and is contributor in Forbes also recommend to invest money in index funds and ETFs as a long term investment to keep costs low and to limit risks, because she thought those investments have no risk of companies' bankrupt or the decline of customers' interest toward those companies. Therefore, I recommend to put money into low risks and low profits stock item for making benefits. 
	The second reason why I think putting money into stock trading is one of the best investment methods is that investors do not need to put a great deal of money initially. People can start investment with small amount of money like one hundred dollars. Until investors become familiar with it, they can invest the hundred dollars into stock items to train themselves and to minimize risks. For example, when I started, I was very concerned about losing my money. So, I only invested five hundred dollars into the stock. By managing the small amount of money, I could train my investing skill, minimize risks, and learn how to invest. However, if people want to invest real estate, it would require great amount of fund. Thus, investing real estate is almost impossible to normal people. Moreover, putting money into gold also require to spend a lot of cash from investors, even though it has very low benefits. Hence, I suggest to invest money into stock. 
	Some people might think stock trading is not safe, because they may have an experience in losing money or have seen others lose their whole money. However, I cannot agree with the argument, because as I have mentioned above, investors can control their risks. In most case, many capitalists put their money in high risk and high profit stock item to make benefits as soon as possible, since they are not satisfied with the low profit. However, most of them only experience lose their asset. After losing it, they have a mindset that stock trading is not a good way to make profits. I think they lost their money, because of their greed. If stockholders put their money into low risk and low benefit stock items, they would not lose their asset. 
	In conclusion, I think stock trading is one of great methods to increase people's assets. Most of people think it is not a good way just because of high risk. However, stock trading is not a lottery. If people want to generate profit quickly, I recommend people to buy the power ball. In order to make a benefit through putting money into stock trading, investors need to care about the stock market, pick low risks and low risks stock item, or ask advice from a professional such as fund manager and financial analyst. Based on those methods, people also can make benefits by putting money into stock trading. That's why I suggest to people to invest money into stock trading.

The sleep quality 
	'We are such stuff. As dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.' Sleep quality is very important for everyone because a good sleep will help us to relax the pressure of stress, especially college students. As a college student study in Purdue University, I have sleep problem because I have to do a lot of academic works for a day. Sometimes, I will study over night to prepare for exams and do the homework. It is hard to study in the college. Because of it, I can't get enough sleep so that I haven't too much energy for the next day study. Base on that, I think the poor sleep quality is the main reason causes the negative and positive influence in the academic performance. 
	As a freshman college student, it is difficult for me to study in college. The lack of sleep is a big problem for me and it makes me always late to the class. For example, when I study in the class, I can't concentrate to the content and hard to performance well. In addition, the memory is big part of our academic study and the memories are affected by sleep which would help us to underlie our memory consolidation. In the other hand, the shorten sleep causes another problem which is I can not understand some contents which the teacher teaches in the class so that it is hard for me to do the homework. Also, the sleep loss makes me have a poor communication and normal learning in the class, for instance, when I had group work need to discuss, I couldn't followed our steps or involved into the activities. Therefore, it is difficult for the group members to communicate with them about the group works. So I can know sleep quality affect the academic study from the sleep quality effect of the academic learning. 
I notice that college students always complain that they have to study over night to finish their works in order to get a good score. They also have to wake up early for the next day morning class. Most of them sleep less than 8 hours. A bad sleep affects students' mood, energy level and ability to focus, concentrate and learn which will also affect our academic performance. On the opposite side, if students sleep at least 8 hours before the class and exams, their memory recall and ability to keep concentration to be improved. So as college students, if we want to perform well in studying, we have to get a good sleep. From the article which I searched before, they found out that the students who focus on their emotions and anxiety during the high-stress period are more likely shorten their sleep, the other one who tend to ignore emotions and focus on tasks extend their sleep and shut themselves off from stress. On the basis of their survey of the college students' average sleep length, backgrounds and the average of GPA to see the connection between the sleep quality and academic study, they found that the students who sleep over 9 hours have the higher GPAs that the short sleepers who sleep less than 6 hours a night. The students who sleep between 7 to 8 hours are no significantly different from the long or short sleepers. From that, we can know the poor sleep quality has negative affection on the academic study. 
	From all of above, the sleep loss has negative effect on school performance like the limit of memory and concentrate in the class. And the students stay up to study over night so that they can't get enough sleep. Because of it, I think the sleep quality is the main reason to make a negative and positive influence on the academic study. In general, a college student's sleep quality and study are tightly connected. So we cannot only focus on study and ignore the quality of our sleep. Furthermore, as a college student, I think that we should make a reasonable plan for our daily life as well as make sure that we have a good sleep quality to achieve our study goal.

"Money Management Among College Students 
Recently, It's very common for us to find a phenomenon about that college students always have no enough money to buy lots of things they want although they are not out of money. They always waste their money in different factors in which they may not realize. That reflects money management plays an essential role among college students. Money Management, in other words, manage our money by using some specific ways to realize the maximum profit. Some people may think that just adults can manage their money, but in my opinion, college students can manage money by using their own ways. 
In my interview process, my interviewee considered that it's no necessary for college students to manage their money, she thought college students is too immature to understand money management, it's very difficult for them to operate these methods to realize money management in their daily lives, they can use the proficient method like adults until they step to the society. However, I think college students can manage their money by using means in their age. 
The common way for them to do is to use credit card wisely. This way was referred in one of the papers that I found: ""Pass along money-management tips every college students should know."" A recent study which report by Sallie Mae reflects that more a half college students has more than one credit cards to balance their money, and most of their balance are more than 7000 dollars, put money into credit cards is a good way for them to keep their money. 
Using credit card correctly is a skill for us to handle. First, keep a good credit history is very essential for us. If we miss some payments, the bank will record it, and that will decrease our credit score, more seriously, we may cause loan and lots of troubles. Furthermore, avoid using as many credit cards as possible. For each of us, keep one credit card to save our money is enough, it's useless to use many credit cards to save money since each credit card has the same function for us to utilize. More credit cards will also cause higher risk of financial debts, it's no necessary for our college students to take this risk. Finally, notice the credit limit frequently. My interviewee also told me that she always taught her own child to put his money into saving account to manage money in his age, so I do the same method with her. In my life, I always put my money into checking account and saving account separately, usually, checking accounts is at least 50 dollars, the large rest of money is putting on the saving account since they are much safer than checking account. I need to make sure the amount is no less than 50 dollars. Otherwise, I'll be charged extra fees for my credit limit. So use our credit cards correctly is a way for college students to manage money in their daily lives. 
Another method is planning our money reasonably. The author Bennit, J, T. in his paper ""Money-Management skills for college students & parents "" involves a Financial planning for us to reference. By planning our daily money, we can also manage our money. For example, we can create a special personal budget for our daily outcome. By dividing amount of money into different uses, like allocate some of money into school expense, the tuition fee, the book fee, study tools fees, etc. All these fees can be generalized unavoidable fees in our life. Others can be used for living fees, the necessities of life, clothes, foods and drinks of daily life. We also need to left specific money of the emergency fees for the unexpected future. Except these, we also need to allocate money periodically. Just to check the number of our money in a specific time, it's more convenience for us to control the money use for the next days, we don't need to worry about over the outcome. 
From all the opinions that I stated above, college students can manage money by using some specific methods of their age, they don't need to use the professional methods like the adults used to manage money. All these methods that I involved in this paper is universal used among college students, I highly recommend college students to try these methods manage their money in their daily lives since it's very easy to operate, and I believe these methods will work for managing our money in some ways.

Argumentative Essay 
	On February, 5th, 1999, a surprising event occurred in the US. Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Black man, was killed by four NYPD officers. When Diallo was pulling out his wallet and trying to show them identification, the officers fired forty-one shots at him in seven seconds since they mistook the wallet for a gun. Looking to another case happened on August 9, 2014, Michael Brown, an eighteen-year-old black man, unarmed was shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson. When we go through our memory, we can come up with a lot of examples proving that ""white people shoot unarmed black suspects more often than unarmed white suspects"", which is called ""shooter bias"" (Markman). In fact, this kind of unfair bias and the stereotype of black men (e.g. black men are dangerous) cause the negative influences for those innocent people. From my perspective, the stereotypes do negatively affect our today's society. 
	According to Baumeister and Bushman, the definition of stereotype is that ""beliefs that associate groups of people with certain traits"" (Baumeister and Bushman). It is one of the ""heuristics"", that is, the mental shortcuts that people use to quickly estimate the likelihood of uncertain event. In fact, stereotype is usually divided into two perspectives, ""perceiver"" and ""target"" (Khan, Benda and Stagnaro). For the perspective of perceivers, most of the stereotypes appear unconsciously. For instance, some college students are required to list the traits that can best describe people from different ethnic groups. The results of this experiment show that the automatic stereotypes can be formed due to either one's past experiences or the own opinions. As for targets, they, in fact, sometimes accept and believe that the stereotypes are actually true and may suffer from ""stereotype threat"" (Khan, Benda and Stagnaro, 5). 
For starters, the stereotypes can impair one's performance indirectly. The stereotypes may affect the people's anticipation of certain groups and thereby influencing the people's attitudes and behaviors. This phenomenon is called ""self-fulfilling prophecy"", which means ""a prediction that ensures, by the behavior it generates, that it will come true"" (Baumeister and Bushman). For example, correlation between IQ scores and socioeconomic status (SES), ""0.40"", has been proved repeatedly through experiments (Croizet and Claire, 588). The teachers will already have a stereotype that the students from poor families will have lower intelligence and perform worse than kids from middle-class families, which lowers the teachers' expectation for these poor kids. Their attitudes toward the students from low-status families will become negative thereby caring and teaching less to these students. The changes in teachers' attitudes and behaviors can actually render the students from low socioeconomic background perform badly and therefore prove the anticipation eventually. 
Futhermore, someone's potential abilities can be thwarted by stereotypes. As I mentioned in the second paragraph, ""stereotype threat"" is ""the fear that one might confirm the stereotypes that others hold"" (Baumeister and Bushman). For example, an African American may be afraid that if one fails a math exam, he or she may accepts that the failure substantiates the stereotype of low intelligence and thereby preventing him or her pursuing further on the mathematics. Besides, others may prevent someone from challenges that may cause him or her suffering from stereotype threat. For instance, Vikki Yuan, the person I interview was an Asian, and planning to major in psychology. Since Asian students are usually be stereotyped as good at mathematics but poor at humanities and liberal arts, she was always being told that she should change her plan and try to major in some subjects that Asians are good at. These suggestions may hurt her confidence and stop her from continue studying psychology. Although she has a lot of interests in psychology, her potential abilities in psychology may be impaired because of those who maintain stereotypes for her. 
It is certain that stereotypes are quite convenient since they provide us a way to judge others quickly and effortlessly. Since we are busy in the society and we do not have much time to judge each person carefully, the information provided by stereotypes are good enough for us to handle most of our lives. Besides, stereotypes sometimes can bring some positive influences to certain groups of people. For example, women are usually stereotyped to be poor at quantitative skills but good at verbal skills, while Asian American are thought to be the opposite. However, one experiment found that when their Asian identity was primed, Asian American women have better performance on quantitative skills but worse when their female identities are primed. This experiment definitely proved that the stereotypes can boost and improve the performance of certain social groups. 
Obliviously, it is kind of difficult to change people's opinions due to the ""confirmation bias"", that is, ""the tendency to notice and search for information that confirms one's beliefs and to ignore information that disconfirms one's beliefs"" (Baumeister and Bushman). However, we should not stop trying to fight against stereotypes. Since most of stereotypes happen unconsciously, it is necessary to educate more, let the public aware of it, and try to reduce it consciously. Also, the cooperation among different ethnic groups are needed. All of the groups should fight toward a common goal, and role models may be effective to lead a way. Besides the effort from the public, the ""support of authorities, law, or customs"" can be powerful and pervasive for people to change their minds (Khan, Benda and Stagnaro, 4). 
It is undoubted that stereotypes have some positive influences. It is quick and helps us save the efforts and sometime improves the performance of certain groups. However, the information provided by stereotypes can be inaccurate, and most of stereotypes can impair one's performances and thwart his or her potential capacities. In order to reduce the negative effects of stereotypes, it is necessary to educate the public and reduce it consciously. Also, the cooperation between different groups and the supports from powerful authorities and organization are needed to make the society a better place.

Should college students let their parents decide their major? 
When students graduate from high schools, they can choose to work, pursue a higher education. If they choose to enter a college to continue their study trip, they will need to choose a major before they graduate from the college. It is a tough question for some students because they have never chosen a major before. At this moment, some of them may ask their parents opinions. Some parents may directly ask their children to choose a major. It may have a question. ""Should these students let their parents decide their majors? From my point of view, students should choose their majors by themselves. 
One reason is that students should choose their majors by themselves. Most students may not realize which one is their favorite major at the beginning, but most of them can find that major after one or two years. If the student selects the major which he is interested in, he will like to study the relevant knowledge of that major. If he likes to study, he will get a power to push him to study. In the college, if you do not have a power to push you, you may not like to study by yourself. However, the self-study is the main way to absorb knowledge. Also, there is no one having the responsibility to convince students to work hard. If you have not learnt enough knowledge, you may not pass the exam. It means you may not graduate from the college. To have a power is not to get a college degree; it is to help you to achieve your goal. When students can graduate, they can choose to work or continue to study some very specific areas. If the students are not interested in their majors, they may not understand which professional area should they select. My college adviser, Mr. <name> agreed with me. He said he chose the history as the college major, but he was not sure it was a right choice to select history. After listening to his parents' suggestions, he chose the history because his parents told him the history would be his favorite major. After he got the history degree in Purdue, he thought history may not the best fit for him because he did not feel any power to push him work on. His body refused to work or study in history. After several times thinking, he realized his interested major was education. Then, he decided to pursue a education bachelor degree. Studying his interested major, <name> felt he got a power to do some relevant things such as becoming an adviser. Now, he has his specific future plan and he think he can achieve it. To find an interested major is not just for study; it is to give you a power to achieve your future goal. 
Another one is college should adjust college life by themselves rather than depending on their parents. Before students decide their majors, they have to adjust the college life. If they do not adapt the college life, they may have a huge pressure. This pressure may cause the student make a wrong choice. When students get into the college, they will need to be more independent than before. As the college life has a huge difference with the high school life, college students will require to solve more problems individually. One reason is your college may be far away from your home. Your parents cannot stay with you for a long time. Another one is communication will help students find self-worth. According to Agliata and Renk's research, students cannot adjust college life well when there were few communications with their parents to students should build more communications with their parents instead of executing their order. When students can adjust college life well, they will find their self-worth. The self-worth will guide students to the right major choice. 
Moreover, if I become a father, I will let my children select their majors because too much parents' control will not help children find the suitable major. Some parents may say their children often accept their advices. Also, they will prefer to do what their parents asked. Selecting the right major can change children's future. Then these parents will think it is their duty to select the right major to their children; they will make a specific future plan to their children as well. However, the plan and the choice may harm to their children's college life. Schiffrin and partners have found students who had many helicopter parenting behaviors would have high level depression and decreased satisfaction with life. (helicopter parenting means parents will watch and give orders to their children) It means students will get more depression and less satisfaction with life when parents control their children more and more. 
In Conclusion, students should choose their major by themselves. One is students' interest will give students powers to pursue their future goals; another is students' independence in college will help students find their self-worth. Moreover, too much helicopter parenting will make students have high level depression and decreased satisfaction.

Negative Effects of Students Using Credit Cards 
Using credit cards has many negative effects on the financial status of students. Students access to a credit card, fail to control their spending habit and this repeated action increase in financial consumption habits. Credit cards provide simple and convenient services, making students feel that they have access to free cash that can be used to purchase products they like. This feeling stimulates impulsiveness among students and influences their financial condition in a negative way. Using credit cards causes serious problems for students as they develop huge amount of credit card payments and end up in a financial crisis where they fail to save anything and end paying everything for monthly credit card payments. 
	College students are greatly vulnerable to the use of credit cards. Since, they are not matured enough to handle money, they show increased spending patterns after they access to credit cards. Many students lose self-control and make impulsive payments, and develop habits of purchasing everything they desire through credit. I had interviewed with an expert, <name> to discuss about the students using credit cards and the negative effects of credit cards. <name> emphasized the significance of financial management. He said that Students have to construct the healthy financial status in early age to accomplish the steady financial status in the future. Also, the interviewee mentioned that the ""credit cards tempt users to spend more than necessary"". Students hold credit cards with misunderstanding of credit cards. They treated the credit as their income and overly use the credit cards. Then, Students are forced to pay a larger monthly interest and late fees over monthly payments. In addition, failure to control their spending habits also increases their debt and leads to poor credit rating when they fail to pay back the bank before deadline. 
	Another major disadvantage of using credit cards is the limited or no savings done by students. Services that provided from the credit cards stimulate students' spending that using over the balance even there is lack of cash. Having credit cards offer the convenient services that students pay or buy immediately without having money with them. However, this convenient service can end up with terrible outcome. Before students realize the negatives of aspects of using credit cards, they are already in a huge amount of debt from the careless spending and large monthly interest payments. Also, believing that debt can be paid back in the future, some people may accumulate debt with no anxiety. Overspending leads to the development of financial anxiety among students as they do not have the financial resources or incoming income to pay the debt back (Limerick & Peltier, 2014). 
	Many students end up in a risky financial condition as their credit dries up and they do not have the money to service their debt (Robb & Pinto, 2010). As students cannot suppress their impulsiveness, they discover products and services that they desire. Impulsiveness leads to continuous overspending, debt overload, long-term expenses on credit card, and prevents students from financial gains. Credit card companies charge significantly large interests to students for their services. These large interest payments are above the principal amount that needs to be paid back. However, if students try to save the money and keep the proper budget line, students can collect the money for the future life and they can gain yearly interest from the bank. It is much better than they end up spending huge amounts money by credit cards and pay interest back to the bank. 
Use of credit card has several negative consequences on students as they not only need to pay huge interest payments and monthly late fees. Using credit card forces students into financial trouble as they spend on products and services that are beyond their financial abilities. The result is seen in their financial condition as students end up in financial crisis. Their financial condition faced danger when they need to pay the principal amount and the interest payment. Using credit cards also have long-term negative impacts too, as students develop huge credit card debt and develop poor credit ratings. It is important that students fully recognized about how credit cards work and they need to aware the possible negative effects of the using credit cards that can face with the financial crisis.

"Offering Tea Art Course for University Students 
When I worked in teahouse most customers, relatively educated middle-class, did not know how to prepare tea properly, and some of them even did not know basic manner when they drank tea. The most common way people drank tea is simply mix green tea with boiled water. Because temperature is too high, destroyed vitamin C results in taste bitter. Obviously, Chinese tea culture is fading away from Chinese life. Hence, it is urgent to preserve our own tea culture, and the most efficient way is offering tea art course as interest course for university students. Through the tea art course, students have a chance to learn Chinese tea culture and Chinese tradition. Besides, when students study tea art course also improve their relationship with each other. More importantly, preserving tea itself as intangible cultural heritage matters for China. 
Some people may complain about that university is place for academic study not for personal interest. In addition, there are schools aimed for tea art study. Hence it is not necessary to offer tea art course for students in university. It is true that there exist tea art schools for people to study, but most of those schools need pay high tuition that most students cannot afford. The high cost for learning tea art contributes the decay of Chinese tea culture. Besides, like art class, tea art class teaches students how to appreciate aesthetic, which also is an important component of university class. If university provide tea art course for students, it will provide an opportunity for students to study tea art in low cost. Through the class, students not only learn about Chinese tradition but also benefit their social relationship. 
Providing tea course for students in university also could improve students' relationship with each other. Dr. Pettit took tea art class in China and expert in Chinese religion, and he mentioned that tea played an important role in our social life. Generally, people would like to share good quality tea with their friends. On the same time when them enjoy tea, the tea also facilitates conversation. Dr. Pettit stated, ""The more you enjoy the tea, the more comfort you enjoy the conversation."" In Saberi's article also talked about the importance of tea as medium during the business conversation in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Due to the usefulness of tea in personal relationship, tea course held in tea party form will enhance students' communication and improve their friendship. In nowadays, people especially youth cannot live without mobile phone and laptop. They prefer to text to others and talk through mobile phone. When people hang out with their friends they still spend most of their time on those advanced technology. It seems that students are getting away from each other. However, through tea art course they can share their experience about drinking different tea, and simply have fun and relax during the process of preparing tea. 
Protecting tea culture itself is profitable in tea industry. As for the economic interest aspect, ancient tea-horse road is a classic example that tea culture contributes to the economy growth. When tea culture was thrived in China Tang dynasty, remote small town in south where is ideal place to produce tea had constructed ancient tea-horse road as far as reached India Tibet and Nepal. People in those village exchanged tea for horses. With the development with transportation, those small villages experienced rapid economic growth because more material, opportunities and information were obtained. Those south remote villages in old days are rich big city in China like Fujian province and Guangdong province with the advantage of transportation. If the tea culture is thrived again, the whole tea industry will increase, contributing to economy increase. For example, Hollywood makes millions dollar every year because of their popular movie culture attracts a lot of tourists to Universal Studio. 
Protecting tea culture itself is meaningful because culture is soft power bringing spiritual support to people and taking mental pleasure. Tea culture bears the weight of historical tradition and Buddhism. A 2003 article by David Grigg stated that tea is related to Zen Buddhism. Dr. Pettit also state that ""We can drink tea at home instead of going to Buddha siting and participating in Buddhist ritual, which also strengthening your awareness sense and creating different sensation of difference perception."" Tea culture is related to Buddhism closely `because of the meditation need of monk. During the long time meditation, monks might feel sleepy and tired. Providing with the condition, drinking tea helps them keep awake and stay away from distractions. Hence they can sit quietly and peacefully. Even in daily life, drinking tea provides a chance for us to mediate a short time so that we can receive mental pleasure. 
Considering protect Chinese tradition culture, improve student's relationship, bring economic profit and mental pleasure, offering tea art class for university students is necessary. After class, when students drink at home, they also could teach their family members how to drink and prepare tea properly. In addition, learning tea culture is not only just personal's responsibility but also need government or social organizations like universities to encourage public to learn and preserve tradition culture. Otherwise, precious culture like tea ceremony may disappear in the future.

"Is League of Legends a good game to play? 
League of Legends is now a hot topic all over the world. We can always see people talking about it with joy in their faces. League of Legends is so enjoyable a game that it can easily attract people to play it. However, we may sometimes ignore an important question------is it worth for youth playing League of Legends? According to my study these months, I can surely tell that League of Legends is a game with countless advantages and is definitely worth playing. 
As a typical example of video game, League of Legends has tons of good effects on young people. First of all, people can gain great tacit agreement when plying League of Legends with friends. I am a League player since 2011, and I played a lot with friends when I was in high school. Memory of playing it with friends is really unforgettable. Since League of Legends is a 5 vs 5 team battle game, my friends and I would always play together in a local net bar. To be honest, none of us played well in this game, but we did had great fun! The feeling was like playing basketball together with friends, every one of us should concentrate, and do our own job. For example, if I was a top lane player, I would usually have to farm hard, build tank, take damage in a team fight and try to do as much damage as I can. Other teammates would have different jobs, but what to do is really clear for everyone. I enjoyed a lot helping each other, saving a teammate or revenge for an ally, although it was just a game. I could truly feel that our friendship was strengthened. A game that can give you great fun, and help strengthen friendship at the same time. Now do you think League of Legends is worth playing? 
The benefits of League of Legends are far more than what I just mentioned. Teens who play video games are actually better off than teens who don't play at all, according to a recent study by Przybylski 2016, p. 1 of the University of Oxford in England. Przybylski found that gamers have fewer emotional problems and are less hyperactive than non-gamers. Kids who play video games for up to an hour a day also tend to be more social than those who don't play at all, he says. Video games can also reinforce computer literacy, math and English skills, and knowledge of history, says Kurt Squire, co-director of the Games Learning Society in Wisconsin. More than 2,500 schools worldwide use Minecraft to build math skills and to teach history, biology, architecture, engineering, and other subjects. Playing video games -- even violent ones -- is also a great way for teens to wind down, says C. Ferguson 2016, p.1, a psychologist at Stetson University in Florida who has studied gaming's therapeutic effects. ""It seems to be an activity that soothes people and can reduce their stress,"" Ferguson tells JS. ""They have a bad day, they play, and they feel better afterward.""p. 1 
To sum up, League of Legends is a game that we can have great fun with, and strengthen friendship from it. Also League of Legends has great benefit on young people. Although it has some shortcomings, we can overcome them if we pay enough efforts. Overall, League of Legends is a game that well worth playing.

"Whether all people should accept technology education. 
Recently, the technologies has dramatically changed our life from different fields. As the fundamental factor of technologies, the technology education cause some heated discussions. One of them is whether all people should accept technology education. As for the issue, different people have different ideas. Some of them think that it is right for the importance of technology education. However, others believe that only technicians should accept technology education. Personally speaking, I deem people should accept technology education. 
From my interview about professor Nancy, she explained that the technology education for technicians and ordinaries should be different. Because of the technology education plays a different role and causes different impact of them. I totally agree with her in technology education. As a result, I will analyze the importance of technology education individually for technicians and general people in following parts. 
General People 
At first, the technology education is very useful for them to enrich technological knowledge and improve their interest of them. As we all known, the technology education are parts of general education for it contains physics, chemistry and etc. Through the development of technology, our life has changed dramatically. In the past, there were not cars drove on the road, stuff selected on Internet, and graphs printed by printers. However, right now, it is common that tons of car running on the road, people do shopping online, and use computer to learn and work. The reason of the change is technology education. From the report of UNESCO, in 1990, the adult literacy rate is 10.9% at the lowest, and 87.6% at the highest. However, in 2015, the adult literacy rate has increased to 36.0% at the lowest and 95.5% at the highest. The technology education people accepted help them to master these new technologies easily and quickly. So, people should accept technology education for use new technologies better. 
Secondly, it is necessary for general people to enrich technology education. Because in the modern society, the technologies becomes more and more popular for they have greatly improve the efficiency and reduce time. For example, the technology of computer and Internet. Right now, as a student, it is common to finish homework online. As a student in Purdue University, I have to learn to finish my math homework by Webassign online, arrange my courses schedule on My purdue, and update my chemistry laboratory video on Blackboard. Moreover, as workers, it is common to finish projects, graphs and reports by Words and Excel. So, it is easy to conduce that it is necessary for general people to accept technology education in order to use modern technology easily and expertly. 
Technicians 
The first points I want to express is that the technology education help technicians to master the professional skills and knowledge. In the technology education, technicians are educated to find the problems in technology and come up to new solutions. From the interview of professor <name>, she expressed the same ideas. She spoke that in the technology education of technicians, we educate student to find problems in real production and solve them. Moreover, she claimed that we also should help them to enrich professional and technological knowledge and improve their skills and abilities in producing. Take my own experience for example. In <course>, I learn the professional knowledge about the plastic and high-polymer material in lecture. Then, I do the related experiment in laboratory. I heat the plastic first, and blow it in a mold to form a bottle. From the process, I find the shortcoming of the method that the heat time is long and a mount of material is wasted. I am encouraged to find the solutions. From my researches, the whole process could do by automatic system in which the temperature and time are set so that the time will reduce and material will save. So, the technology education is very important for technological students and technicians to enrich professional knowledge and skills. 
Furthermore, the technology education is useful for technicians to develop some important skills. Loveland and Dunn (2014) list some crucial abilities of a human being in their article, teaching engineering habits of mind in technology education. Some of them are system thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication. Take the ability of communication for example. In a producing and learning process, there are still some problems which have to solve by group work. So, in process of finding solutions, the ability of communication of technician will develop and improve. 
In short, the technology education is very important for all people. So, all people should accept technology education. For general people, the technology education help them to enrich professional knowledge, master modern technologies and improve the interest of technology. Moreover, the wide popularization and application of technologies push ordinaries to accept technology education. As for the technicians and technological students, the technology education help them to learn the professional knowledge, maser technological skills and develop other abilities. As a result, above all mention, I think all people should accept the technology education.

Safety and Security in Urban Space 
According to Maslow's hierarchy needs, safety is the second need after physical need. With rapid development, people start gathering to cities, where have tons of opportunities, and . Urban space is public area in cities and everyone can enjoy them. We should pay attention to the difference of safety and security. The safety of a place is inherent in its design. As suppose to security, which is others going to be able to hurt you in space. It may sound plausible that because urban space is public and open, people do not need to pay attention to it. In fact, bad things occur in urban space: children often fall down on stairs; disabled people with wheelchairs can not squeeze into a small elevator; gangsters threaten people in parks. From my perspective, people should put emphasis on safety in urban space. My statement will be further illustrated by three aspects: the relationship between green space and feelings of social safety, exclusionary space for disabled people, outdoor play space design for children. 
Some people may think, a space with many trees may have dangerous animal or people hidden in it. However, Contrary to theirs expectations, women and elder people with more green space feel safer. Also, in this case, it is the urban area we are talking about, so it is not necessary to worry about the dangerous animal. Usually people feel relaxer when surrounding by nature environment, and not trend to implement crimes. Additionally, according to the study done in Chicago and St. Louis, urban space without green space causes more significant crime than the one with green space. If green space is able to decrease crime rate, then we can say it is making people feel more security . 
Some people may think it is unnecessary to build disabled facilities or think it is a waste of space and money. However, it is our duty to give respect and convenience to disabled people. We should consider their safety as the same time when we consider normal people's safety. Also, it may take more time to make a safer place for disability. For example, If one can not grasp, in the way that strong enough, he or she can not use gates or handles, handrails, and drinking fountain. In that instance, it has more to do with barrier free access to people of all abilities. Also, if we are building the public security report system, we need to consider if it is possible to a person with wheelchair to reach the emergency button. Therefore, we not only need to consider the safety and security of normal people, but also need to spend more energy on how to make it a safety and security apace for disabled people. 
Some people may think we already done a great job on children. However, there are still children get hurt in the play space, maybe just cut their finger or even lost their lives, so there are still many ways we can do better. Children should play for now, not just part of process of becoming an adult; being a child, not just the biological determination of becoming an adult, and disability as a social not a medical model. We also need to build a safer and more secure place for children. Also we need to be careful about the safety of children, since they may not know or may not be able to protect their self when facing dangerous, so it is more necessary to improve the security facility for children's space, like more safety camera and emergency button that a child can easily reach. 
If we consider the last two point together, we have a new topic ""disabled children"". People may think it is only their parent's' job to take their own children. However, it is not true, it is the responsibility to make this world a safer place for all the children in our society. According to a research about ""exclusionary space (Carmona 20)"". There are two kinds of barrier of design outdoor play space. One of the barrier of understanding disabled children is lack of involving disabled children and adults in the design process. In other words, they do not know how to design for disabled children, or even for any children (Woolley 1). The other barrier is that some knowledge of designing for disabled children has not been discovered. When we consider about the design for disabled children, we must be more carefully, because they are weaker and we also don't want them to find they are different from others and feel sad about that. 
When we design an urban space or build a public area. Safety and security are always the first two things we need to consider. They directly relate to our health and life. With the shortage of any of these two, no matter how beautiful this place is how much money was spended, the facility will be abandoned at last, because no one want to put their health and life in danger. It is our duty to make our city a safer and more secure place.

"P5D1 Argumentative Paper 
April 10, 2015 
Will You Choose the Major You Are Interested In Or Better To Your Future? 
	When a child is brought to the surface of the earth, it does not have the ability to discern wrong and right. Thus, the guardian of the child is charged with the responsibility of making decisions on its behalf. A guardian is required to make decisions that are in the best interest of the child. By so doing, the child will live a healthy life. As children develop, they are furnished with information and skills that facilitate them to make suitable decisions. As they make various kinds of decisions, they appreciate that the quality of their choices will have direct implications for their lives (Andrews, 2006). As such, the majority of human beings progressively enhance their proficiency in decision making on a regular basis. Students make numerous decisions on a daily basis. Most of the decisions that they make have direct repercussions on their academic performance and life in general. Choosing a major is amongst the most significant decisions that are made by students. The type of major that a student chooses will have an effect on their future prospects. As a consequence, it is essential for students to choose majors that they are highly passionate about so as to enhance their future. This paper aims at discussing the essence of choosing a major that one is passionate about in order to better the future prospects. 
In most scenarios, students face a dilemma with regards to choosing a major. This is primarily because the majors that students choose will determine their career paths. It is best for guardians, school counselors, and academic instructors to provide students with relevant career exposure prior to choosing their majors. This is a stratagem that aims at affording students with the opportunity to choose majors that are likely to enable them to realize their dreams. A successful career is usually developed through dedication, working hard and excellent decision-making (Harris & Jones, 2007). This is principally because the sort of career that an individual achieves is developed progressively. Choosing the most suitable major is at the heart of attaining a successful career. 
In this light, there are parties who opine that students should choose their careers on the basis of the ease to secure an opportunity for employment. Persons who support this vantage point claim that the fundamental intent of education is to enable an individual to attain a financially successful life. As such, they encourage students to rationalize the process of choosing a major (Nadler, 2006). The primary shortcoming of this ideology is that it fails to appreciate that human beings are emotional in nature. This implies they have a wide variety of needs and students should take account of such factors when they are choosing their majors. This is a stratagem that aims at enabling the students to choose a major that will endow them with the highest degree of satisfaction in life. 
Interestingly, choosing a major on the basis of the demand for a particular set of expertise may not be the most suitable approach. This is chiefly because the demand for a particular skill set varies in accordance to a vast array of market factors. As such, it might seem like the safest channel to an ideal job opportunity and prosperous life it can be highly risky. There is an extremely high likelihood that variations of the market factors can shift the demand for the career that you had already chosen (Harris & Jones, 2007). Consequently, this can lead to stress, disorientation, and frustration. A student who chooses hers or his major on account of the career that they are passionate about is likely to experience a comparatively high degree of peace despite the variance of the market factors. Often, such individuals consider such situations to be challenges that need to be overcome so as to establish a prosperous career. These type of individual typically deduce inner strength to continue working towards the realizing the career of their dreams despite any setbacks that might be prevalent. 
Moreover, it is appropriate for students to choose their majors on the basis of their passion. Students that choose majors that are in line with their passion tend to perform better than the one who do not. This is principally because such students tend to enjoy the coursework of the various units that pertain to their major (Andrews, 2006). They are highly inspired and interested in the numerous issues that are being covered in their respective major. Consequently, they naturally gravitate towards gaining advanced knowledge about their respective major. What is more is that students who choose majors that they are passionate about usually end up in the most suitable careers. This is simply because such students do not necessarily take up conventional career paths. Instead, they can develop and design a career that best suits them. Therefore, they are more likely than their counterparts to attain a comparatively high degree of accomplishment in their professions, as well as private lives. 
	Evidently, choosing a major can be a task that is overwhelming for most students. However, the community can enable students to choose the most suitable majors through exposure and proper guidance (Harris & Jones, 2007). Passion is superior to practicality when choosing a major. This is primarily because the need for achievement if amongst the factors determines a person's overall degree of satisfaction in life.

Ban the Banning of Books
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. To Kill A Mockingbird. Go Ask Alice. Harry Potter. These are only a few of the hundreds of books that are being challenged and banned in both school libraries and classrooms all over the country. Some of these books are classics that we read in junior high school, ones that our parents read when they were children. They are on school curriculum lists everywhere. Teachers recommend these books to their students because they help teach valuable life lessons. However, there are people that feel the need to rid schools of these wonderful books. Who are they? Parents! Mostly conservative, religious parents. Sixty one percent of reported book challenges are made by parents (Book Banning). These book challengers are such a small population, and it is incredible that they are getting their way with this. How is it that a few organizations of concerned parents are able to challenge and successfully ban so many books, yet the rest of the population is willing to sit back and do nothing to stop it? Perhaps some do not care. Perhaps some do not have children and they do not realize the impact it can have. Perhaps some are simply unaware that book banning is happening at all. Book readers everywhere need to be informed of this growing problem. It is time to stand up and defend America's right to read.
The First Amendment states that all United States citizens have freedom of speech and press. This allows people to write and speak freely on any topic including religion, global warming, as well as less complex subjects. Suzanne Kauer, a teacher says, ""Everyone has the right to read, view, hear what they want, everyone has the right not to read, view, or hear what they don't want"" (56). This applies to everybody in America, including children and teenagers. However, censorship on children's and young adult books has become a major problem in elementary, junior high, and high school libraries throughout the country.
To challenge a book means to attempt to remove or restrict materials from public view. To ban a book means to actually have the material removed (Banned Books). Censorship occurs when a book is taken away or banned from a classroom or library, and the students are unfairly restricted from their access. It is fair to say that parents have the right to protect their own children from certain material, but what permits their authority over other children? Suzanne Kauer states politely, ""I don't think one parent ought to decide that what doesn't work for his or her own child won't work for the rest of the class or school"" (57). If parents are adamantly opposed to a book in the curriculum, a simple letter to the teacher asking for the assignments alternative text would suffice. This will prevent the book in question from being removed from the program.
Many books are challenged because of obscene language. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was challenged because of the use of the word ""nigger"" throughout the book. Parents think that reading curse words is going to have a huge impact on what their own child says in everyday life. Other titles that have been challenged due to the use of offensive language are The Color Purple, The Chocolate War, Olive's Ocean, TTYL, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower (Book Banning). Yes, the characters in these books curse, but so does a lot of the current population. Children are more likely to encounter swearing in and outside of the classrooms than in the books they read. Also, subjection to offensive material, such as cursing, will not always result in usage by that individual. Some books, such as The Perks of Being a Wallflower, are challenged for more than one reason. In this case, in addition to foul language, it was challenged because of sexually graphic scenes.
Sexually explicit material is likely to get a book challenged or banned as well. Parents worry that certain material is not appropriate for particular age groups. Though this is true in some obvious circumstances, such as not allowing elementary students to read Playboy, restricting them too much will only make them more curious. Many people know from their own childhood experiences, that when an adult says ""Don't touch that"" or ""Don't go in that room while I'm gone"" they are most likely going to do it. Therefore, children and teens will go in search of this material through different sources such as the Internet and potentially other students. Similar to cursing, parents worry that reading this material will encourage young readers to indulge in sexual activities. But this is not necessarily true. As Kauer says, one can be ""in the world but not of the world"" (57). One can enjoy the book for what it is without acting or believing as the characters in the text do. Restricting access to books can make children, especially young adults, feel weak or incapable of handling the world. In other words, adolescents may feel as if their judgment cannot be trusted, and they are incapable of making their own decisions. This is not how anyone should feel. People of all ages should feel that they are strong and can judge things for themselves.
A seventeen year old girl in Texas experienced censorship first hand. She found Marcus Blake's new book called Sex Games in the high school library. The book was brought home. Her father, J.R. Crawford, found her reading it and immediately took action to have it removed from the school district. He, and other members of the Parents for Christ organization, believed that the book was inappropriate because it had the word ""sex"" in the title, and the cover was erotic. Crawford was determined to have this book banned in order to prevent children from becoming morally corrupt (Censor the Book). What he failed realize was that the story between the covers was one of finding true love, and what one will do to get it. What seventeen-year-old girl does not want to explore the journey of true love? The father's reaction to the book was very hasty. He did not look beyond the picture and words on the front cover and in turn, completely missed the meaning of the story inside. It is possible he did not take to heart the saying ""never judge a book by its cover."" Unfortunately, for his daughter, the students in the district, and others throughout the state, the book was removed from school libraries. In addition, it was also removed from some university libraries, public libraries, and bookstores because of fear of controversy (Censor the Book). Throughout this ordeal, the books true meaning remained undefended. Corresponding with sexual material, parents also challenge age appropriateness.
One of the fine lines of book censorship includes age appropriateness. How is it determined which books are correct for which age groups? Books are being censored by parents who think that the material within them is not age suitable. On this occasion, they feel that the content is too mature for the readers it is assigned to. When a child is told not to read a particular book because of this reason, it is very possible that the child or teen will be turned off to reading all together (No to Age Banding). The needs and tastes of the reader must be considered before permitting or denying the right to read the book. Some more gifted students are especially vulnerable to this kind of censorship. Gifted students, students whose IQ's are above 130, are usually passionate readers. Studies have shown that gifted students read three or four times as many books as the average student (Seney, 28) and they are also more adventurous in the kinds of literature they pursue. These students read at a more sophisticated level than their peers. If parents are challenging and banning books based off of age appropriateness, they are severely cutting off the needs of these specific students (Seney, 28). They are already limited with the books in the curriculum, so what happens when even more books are taken off the shelf? They may stop reading altogether. Kelsey Marie, a Professor at the College of Scholastica, says ""A balance must be struck between age and access, but on the whole, intellectual freedom is the overriding principle"" (27). Parents often become guarded when their children read books that contain different religious beliefs and values as well.
When ideas within a book conflict with parent's beliefs, it is likely the book will be challenged. Books such as Bridge to Tarabithia and The Golden Compass have been challenged because of the different religious view points. People will attempt and continue to attempt to suppress anything that disagrees with their own beliefs and values (Banned Books). Restricting children to one view will only delay the teaching process. ""I don't think that students should read books that portray their particular religion.exclusively; that kind of relativism seems as dangerous as fitting everyone into the same mold. After all, one of the best reasons to read is to understand other people and places,"" says Suzanne Kauer (58). The book Fahrenheit 451 is about the burning of books in a future American city. The reason the books were burned within the text was because they presented too many different ideas, which caused more problems and disagreement in society. Literature had become too complex and too many beliefs and values clashed. As a result, the government decided to completely ban and burn all books. Could this be what our current society is heading for? After all, it all began with the censoring of a few books. Then, after books, what will be censored and banned next? Movies? Music? Will there be anything left to show for our individuality?
A number of books that are challenged by conservative parents are books that have encouraged many children to read, such as the Harry Potter series. When I was in the fifth grade I despised reading. I thought it was a waste of time. One day, as a prescription to my boredom, my mother led me to the couch and handed me Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. She said I could not get up until I had read a few chapters, so I reluctantly opened the book and began reading. Initially I was confused and bored, but soon I realized I was able to relate to Harry in the sense that neither of us were popular and we were both waiting for something to happen in our lives that would make everything better and more exciting. With the first mention of magic we both got our wish. Harry discovered a new world where anything was possible and I got to accompany him on his journeys. In a way, I discovered a new world as well: the world of books. From then on, I have become a dedicated reader. A literature fanatic. If books such as this one are able to bring child and book together, why would anyone, especially parents, want to take that away from their own children? These parents should be embracing the fact that their children have found a joy in reading, even if it has magical creatures and witchcraft. Parents need to look past the fact that these books are full of magic and look at the good things they promote such as friendship, love, and trust.
Unfortunately, many parents are against these kinds of books that contain magic, witches, and wizards. The conservative, religious parents encourage the idea that magic in all forms is evil, and that people are to have nothing to do with it. Berit Kjos, a Christian writer, says ""It makes me uncomfortable when children are immersed in topics that make witchcraft very exciting. It can be very confusing for them.it is much tougher for children, with less biblical knowledge today, to evaluate good and evil."" From my own experiences with fantasy books, I have found the opposite to be true. It very easy to identify good and evil, and it has nothing to do with the magic in the story. It was made clear that ""evil"" included lying, cheating, and killing, and ""good"" included friendship, honesty, respect, and love. Mark West, a professor of English with a specialty in children's literature says, ""They [the parents] don't see it as fantasy. They see it as real. A small group of Americans can't accept fantasy that way. They really do care about the books impact, so they go against others' legal rights,"" (Dunne). When book censorship begins to affect other people's access, legal rights need to come first, so how are these small groups of people getting away with banning all these books? I say enough is enough.
Thousands of books in the last few decades have been challenged and banned from school classrooms and libraries all over the country. In fact, in the year 2007, there were 420 challenges recorded by the American Library Association (Book Banning). The banning of books is violating Americans First Amendment rights. The crazy thing is that the people successfully banning these books are such a small group, a tiny portion of America's population. How can we stand by and let our children, our younger brothers and sisters, and our little cousins' rights be stripped away? It is time to stand up to these parents, and defend the books they are trying to hide from us. We must protect these books from banishment and defend their true meaning.

RUNNING HEAD: CONSPIRACY
Conspiracy in the Oval Office
Alicia Jackson
ENG 105
Northern Arizona University
Some of the most memorable events in the United States history are the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President John F Kennedy and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Each event was a tragic one that caused sorrow and destruction while taking many innocent lives. While grieving, some turned to the United States government for answers for who was to blame, while others sought answers from outside sources and blamed the Executive Branch for being involved. Along with the countless books published, movies and documentaries such as ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" by writer/producer Michael Moore attacked the Bush Administration for being involved in the terrorist attack, and ""JFK"" made by the acclaimed director Oliver Stone, was a filmed filled with conspiracy theories and searched for the answers to who shot Kennedy. It is clear that the United States government had prior knowledge of and chose not to intervene, or orchestrated the attacks on the country entirely.
Pearl Harbor was a military base located on the Main Island in Hawaii, and was attacked by Japanese forces on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack and death of so many members of the military caused an uproar of support for the US to officially enter World War II, and that very evening, President Franklin D Roosevelt declared war on Japan. Americans were led to believe that the Executive Branch was completely unaware of Japan's hostility and their impending attack. This, however, is untrue. For a year leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces had been moving across the Pacific towards America, invading and taking control of United States territories. Surely the Roosevelt administration could pick up on the trend occurring and deduct that Pearl Harbor would also soon be attacked, and D. Glick, author of the article ""How Much Did FDR Know?"" in 1991 states that Roosevelt and others in power ""dragged America into was by suppressing warnings of the attacks"" (1). Also, the Japanese use of ""wind codes"" gave cause for suspicion of Japan's intent. Robert Hanyok argues in his 2009 article that the wind codes used in the Japanese media were used to ""warn Japanese diplomats of deteriorating relations between Japan and the United States, Great Britain, or the Soviet Union"" (2). In a time of war, a bad relationship with enemies of one's allies is serious cause for concern. Also, the United States had somewhat soiled the relationship with Japan when they announced that the United States was a protector of democracy and was working to stop the spread of communism during the First World War. It is plausible that Japan saw the United Sates as a threat to their way of government and felt it necessary to show how powerful they were.
The President's actions before the attack, along with the country's economic turmoil caused reason to suspect a conspiracy as well. Just days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt ordered for some military ships and planes be removed from the Harbor and they were saved from the destruction. Luckily, this provided the United States with war materials after the Japanese attack. Whether it was another stroke of luck, or a planned move by Roosevelt, the ships that were left in Pearl Harbor and destroyed were from World War I, and the newer, more advanced materials were saved. It is possible, and understandable, that President Roosevelt removed these ships because he knew of Japan's plans, and wished to save the military supplies so the United States wouldn't be left defenseless with launching a counterattack. The United States entrance into the war also benefitted the economy greatly. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States was in economic turmoil, having been suffering from the Great Depression for seven years. There was little money, jobs and production existing in the United States, and Roosevelt's New Deal Programs were having little impact on the conditions. As it did in the wars before, the United States entrance into the Second World War provided jobs for young men as they went off to fight and jobs for others working in factories to produce other war materials. The existence of jobs gave workers more money to buy goods, quickly improving the economy. From this information, it is understandable that Roosevelt allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to ignite support for US entry into the war, thus lifting the United States from the Great Depression.
The assassination of John F Kennedy is another event surrounded by conspiracy. Riding in a Presidential motorcade in Dallas, Texas, the President was shot four times by Lee Harvey Oswald. Kennedy later died, and Vice President Lyndon B Johnson was sworn in as the next United States President. Many conspiracy theorists argue that Oswald was falsely portrayed as the only gunman involved in the assassination. In an official statement to the media, it was said that Oswald was being arrested and convicted as the man who shot Kennedy, but eye-witnesses state that there were four gunshots fired at the motorcade. If in fact four gunshots were fired, it is impossible that Oswald was the only shooter. The gun he supposedly used in the assassination was an old rifle that could only fire three shots in the time frame of the murder. Another one of the most popular conspiracy theories is the ""Magic Bullet"" theory. This theory states that while only three bullets were found as evidence, the wounds made were the product of four bullets fired. As stated by the Executive Branch, the third bullet fired went through the President's neck and shoulder, and then proceeded to strike the Alabama governor accompanying him in the wrist. Weapons specialists have tried to reconstruct this hit to only include three bullets, but for this to happen, the bullet exiting John F Kennedy would have had to completely change its course while in his chest to be moving in the right direction to hit the governor at all. The picture below illustrates the path the single third bullet would have had to take to strike both the President and Governor.
A writer from the 2001 Progressive magazine states that while he does tend to trust the government, he admits that ""the Warren Commission did a hasty, slipshod job of investigating the Kennedy assassination, leaving many questions unanswered,"" working to prove that the Executive Branch worked to cover up or even ignored questions to avoid that fact that there were four shots fired, to protect the information that Oswald was not the only shooter involved in the assassination (2).
There is evidence in addition to these theories that others in the position of authority wished to be rid of Kennedy for their own personal gain, and Oswald was just a hired assassin. Oswald was portrayed by the media as a devoted communist and it was aired that he had sought citizenship in Russia and Cuba, and he had a great hatred for the United States way of government. This allowed the media to also pin him as someone who hated Kennedy and worked to destroy his work for civil rights movements and get revenge for his work in Vietnam. It is possible; however, that Oswald was hired by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro to assassinate the President. Kennedy had been working with the CIA to secretly remove the dictator from power as they combated against the spread of communism, and Castro may have wanted his own revenge. David Talbot of the 2007 Time magazine argues that although the media was working hard to portray Oswald a communist lunatic, even JFKs brother, Bobby Kennedy, believed Oswald was a member of the shadowy operation that was seeking to overthrow Castro"" and was then used to assassinate the President (2). Some also believe that Vice President Lyndon B Johnson had wanted the President dead to further his own political career. Johnson had been involved in a number of scandals during the Presidential term and had been fearful that he would be excluded from the ticket when Kennedy ran again. Unready to leave the Oval Office, it is likely Johnson hired professional gunmen to murder the President. Other evidence that points to Executive Branch involvement is that the route for the Presidential motorcade had been changed a single day before it was to occur, and only a few people, including the Vice President, would have this knowledge in time to make plans for an assassination. Even if Castro had an informant in the Administration, it would have taken longer for the information to get to him and make changes to place Oswald in the correct place to shoot the President.
One of the more recent attacks on the United States that caused a raise in conspiracy theories is the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. That morning four jet airliners were high jacked from American airports, with two crashing into the Twin Towers, another into the Pentagon and the last in a field in Pennsylvania, causing the death of 2,974 people. President George W Bush and his administration responded by launching a War on Terrorism and invading Afghanistan to rid the country of the al-Qaeda terrorist group. One popular conspiracy theory is that the World Trade Center was brought to ground zero by the explosion of pre-placed explosives, and not the crashing of the planes into the towers. Explosive specialists have stated that the nose-cones of the planes could have been used as large canisters to hold explosive materials. Also, after watching video evidence, it is seen that the expulsion of debris from the towers were consistent with a bomb, rather than a plane crash.
Another theory comes from the suspicion that the airliner which reportedly crashed into the Pentagon was falsified, and it was hit by a missile or smaller plane. The damage done to the Pentagon is consistent with a small fire or controlled demolition, as there is undamaged office materials like books and cabinet with absolutely no fire damage. This is illustrated with the image below. The open book is located the second floor, sitting on a stool. These materials are placed adjacent to the site of the plane crash, now being exposed to open air, with the new absence of a wall.
Also, there is was no baggage collected at the site of the crash. Surely if a large commercial jet crashed into the Pentagon, a few suitcases would be found. In addition to this, the size of the damage done to the building is not large enough to be made from a large airliner. The hole made in the wall was a mere 12 feet wide, not large enough to even be consistent with the damage a single wing of the plane could do.
One popular theory about the plane that was over-taken and crashed in a large field in Pennsylvania is that was actually brought down by a missile. Witnesses report seeing an unmarked white plane in the area of the airliner before it ""crashed"", and there were also reports of seeing flying debris from the plane, like that of an explosion, before it crashed.
Whether it was an assassination or act of terrorism, there is a large amount of evidence to establish that the United States government was involved in the planning of, or ignoring signs of upcoming attacks on the country. The number of videos produced and books written trying to find answers to the question of how much involvement the United States government had, may have no effect on whether the truth is found, but these individuals can find solace in knowing they did not just blindly follow the Administration in charge, and took the initiative to think for themselves.

"Meat and Fruits impact Teenagers Physical Growth 
Puberty is the most significant period of time in people's life, because teenager's physical and mental development occurs in adolescence. Teenagers not only become taller and heavier visibly in adolescence, but also their organs become stronger to support the body structure and transfer nutrition in body. Definitely, teenagers need a lot of nutrition for physical growth, but what kind of food can provide large amount of protein and mineral for physical growth? Fruits, with low fat, plenty of vitamin and much protein, bring more benefit for teenager's physical growth than meat. 
Dr. Weaver, as a interviewee, mentioned that plant fruits provide minerals and vitamins for all living tissue, because fruits almost contain all kinds of vitamin and mineral, like Vitamin C, Vitamin B, calcium and iron. Furthermore, those Vitamin and the majority of minerals are alkalinity substance which can neutralize acidity substance produced by meat. Surplus acidity substance makes teenagers feeling tired and easily to get insomnia, and cancer cell normally occurs in a organ which contain redundant acidity substance. Besides, fruits within low fat contains fiber, calcium and iron which induce the incidence of many disease, like heart disease and osteoporosis. Although it is not obvious of those benefit which fruits can bring to teenagers, it is not advisable to never eat fruits for teenagers. 
Fruits contain much mineral which not only provides essential nutrition for teenager physical growth, but also cure some disease. Anemia, the most prevalent deficiency among adolescence, would be diagnosed if teenagers intake low amount of iron. Carol N. Meredith and Johanna T. Dwyer found that between 11 ages to 14 ages, 4.1% boys and 2.8% girls have anemia, and 7.2% older adolescent girls have anemia. Teenagers are deficient in iron because of consuming few plant foods which have plenty of iron, on the other hand, rapid growth in puberty would increase iron needs for myoglobin and hemoglobin in red cell volume. Iron is plenty in a lot of plant fruits such as peaches and bananas, so teenagers are encouraged to consume those iron-rich fruits to get enough iron for physical growth. 
Vegetarian teenagers never eat meat, but they still can get enough nutrition for physical growth. How can they get benefit from fruits instead of meat? Reed Mangels, Ph.D, stated that vegetarian teenager normally consumes variety plant fruits to make them healthy. For get enough protein, vegetarian teenagers can eat beans, nuts and soy milk, because these foods contains high protein even more than meat. Vegetarian teenagers also need calcium to build their bones strengthening bone density. They often intake calcium from cow's milk, tofu and green leafy vegetable. Eating iron-rich fruits can prevent anemia, vegetarian teenagers also would consume citrus, because citrus contains much Vitamin C which can help teenagers to absorb iron from foods. So vegetarian can get protein, various Vitamin and mineral for physical growth. 
Meat is more important for teenager's physical growth, because meat contains high quality protein and fat which is reserved energy for physical growth. Although fruits cannot totally replace the nutrition role of meat, fruits indeed contain much Vitamin and minerals which meat has. Besides, meat contains acidity substance and surplus acidity substance would harm teenager's physical growth causing some disease. Teenagers in adolescence normally do not know how to balance their diet, so they might be eat more meat than fruits, which results in meat brings more negative affection instead of benefit to teenagers. 
Teenagers are encouraged to consume more fruits than meat, because those evidence shows a lot of benefit for teenager's physical growth. Although teenagers are very hard to see how fruits impacts the physical growth, teenagers absolutely can get enough nutrition from plant fruits. If more and more teenagers realize that plant fruits bring more benefit to their physical growth, the more plant fruits and the less meat teenagers would intake. Animals can be protected efficiently and the environment would be better.

Role of the SAT in the admission process for students 
		The Scholastic Aptitude Test, also known as the SAT is a common test, students around the world take to get into colleges, especially in the US. Although this exam is taken by hundreds of thousands of people, the need for the SAT,i.e, its actual purpose has been often debated. Some people feel that the SAT is just fine right now and that it does not need to change, while others feel that the SAT score is not a true measure of a student's academic aptitude. My view is that the SAT should be modified such that it is more effective. Having a separate SAT exam for each country conducted by a single body, like The College Board would help solve the problem or at least improve the testing process. Having such an exam could help eliminate factors such as ethnic race, language background affecting exam scores. I have reached this conclusion after doing research and interviewing an expert in this field. 
Need for a common test 
A common test score is very useful in the admission process. It helps compare students who have had different High School education. For example, it would be hard to compare students from different countries where in one country the score is given by a GPA, while in the other the students are graded through percentages. Thus, in a sense, the SAT ensures a more level playing field as <Name> talked about in the interview (personal communication, March 23, 2015). The drawback though is that the scores of a student in the exam might be influenced by their ethnic race and language background ( Zwick & Sklar, 2005) . So, there needs to be a way in which the students can still have a common exam but are not unfairly chosen or left out for that matter. 
Alternative to the traditional SAT 
The exam should be made separate such that people living in different regions of the world would have a different kind of test based on what they have learned in High School. College Board would still be conducting the tests, giving students the feel of a common exam. Also, instead of having three sections each of the same subject, the scope of testing the student can be increased by including more testing areas. Again as said before, these extra testing areas would stem from what the students from the same country have learnt in High School. For example, students who have taken more Calculus classes than others might have a bit more Mathematics in their paper and people who have taken Science courses might be tested a bit more in Science. By changing the format of the SAT to the new style, it would be able to test students on how good they are at what they have learnt making the exam a more puroseful one. The definition of content validity seems to agree with the fact that a content based exam should test students based on the skills that are to be known by the student.(Alias, 2005) 
By including the subjects, SAT would factor in some elements of the SAT subject tests making this a broader exam. The exam should also contain an essay section which has a topic that is much relevant to the student. The essay in this paper would test the writing skills of the students and also add to the number of factors being considered in the admission process. 
The Quota System in admission process 
Choosing a set number of students from thousands of applications, is a hard process and involves various components such as the reviewing the GPA, SAT scores, personal essays, recommendation letters, etc. Since different countries have different education systems, the GPAs would be different based on what students learn. This is the reason the SAT is included in the admission process. (personal communication, March 23rd, 2015) Through my readings and the interview process, I have come to the conclusion that there is no simple answer to this complex issue. However, I have also come to the conclusion that there is a way that might be more fair than the current system. The admission process should be made such that it is a level playing field for all students. By this I mean, what if students are chosen by comparing their applications with applications of students from the same country? That is, a student from China is compared with other students from China and this would be the same with students from other countries. This would be called the Quota System in some countries. The National University of Singapore and The Indian Institute of Technology follow this system. (The Quota System, 2014) 
The Quota System would not be too bad as it would ensure that the best students from each country are chosen based on their scores in the proposed form of the SAT. The only problem that colleges would face would be setting the number of students they would want to choose from each country. The number of students from the US should be kept at a constant and high number though to ensure their majority in college. 
The proposed exam might not be highly predictive of success of a student in college as say (1) Conscientiousness of a person, (2) In-class attendance, etc. (Conard, 2006), but it could certainly improve the effectiveness of the admission process and eliminate situations such as ethnicity, language background, etc. affecting the scores of students. With the new kind of exam and a modified admission review process, the quality of students chosen could be taken to a whole new level.

"If sex education is a crucial reason that Chinese and American different opinion toward sex 
Purdue University 
Introduction 
Alena from America and Xiaohong from China are good friends. One day after class, Alena happily told Xiaohong she had sex yesterday with her new date who she met three days ago. Xiaohong is shocked. Alena asked Xiaohong why she is so shocked about this, Xiaohong said she think Alena should wait for several weeks or month to see if her date is the right one for her. Alena thinks it is OK to have sex with the date as the timing is right. Alena and Xiaoming's attitude toward sex can represent some interviewees' attitude who I interviewed toward sex from China and America. Chinese and Americans seems to have different opinion toward sex. Some people said one major difference between Chinese and Americans is American has more qua nuance sex education, but Chinese are lack of it. So sex education is a crucial factor that caused Chinese and American have different opinion toward sex. While I think sex education can be a reason that Chinese and Americans have different attitude toward sex, but sex education is not the most important reason that Chinese and Americans have different opinion toward sexuality. 
First of all, the different opinion about sex among Chinese and Americans can due to many reasons. There are many things could influence what we think of sex. I have interview Professor <name> about what factors can have influences on our attitude toward sex. Professor <name> answered that Culture, tradition, religious, Media, Peers, school education, Physical trauma, Sex (Male vs Female), Families, etc. can be factors that result in different sex attitude. Talking about everyone has his or her one experiences and his or her own insight of the world. The difference between each of human is the marvel of the world. And the individual variation caused we possess a different view about sex. Gender can be a reason that we view sex differently. For example, even women and men will not consider sex as the same way. Anthropologist Helen Fisher (2010) said in a video ""anatomy of sex"", what a man is looking for a woman can be very different from what a woman is looking for a man. Since a woman has only an ovum a time and a man has three hundred million sperms, a woman would be pickier to sperms. She wants to find the best sperm to reproduction. This could explain why sometimes women are more reluctant to have sex than man. 
Besides individual differences, culture and religion can be reasons to explain why Chinese and Americans have different opinion toward sex. China has a long patriarchal social context, this social context somehow influence our social requirement for women are higher than the requirement for women. In Chinese traditional social values, the virginity of women are very important. In ancient China, Fan Zhongyan wrote in ""The cemetery rules"", Chastity shows when people do not have premarital sex. However, as Huber, Valerie J. and Firmin, Michael W said, the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s turned America's moral sensibility on its head (2014). The sexual revolution changes Americans' view toward sex. Attitudes to a variety of issues changed, sometimes radically, throughout the decade. The urge to 'find oneself', the activism of the 1960s, and the quest for autonomy were characterised by changes towards sexual attitudes at the time (M. J. Heale, 2001). 
The religion also can be an important factor that influence our opinion toward sex. In China, religion is not very popular. According to CFPS 2012 survey, Nationwide only 10% of the persons questioned indicated that they had a religious belief, 89.6% described themselves as having no religious belief. Among religious believers, Buddhists were the largest group with around 6.7% of the adults questioned, followed by the Protestants with 1.9%. But in America, there are many believers. According to Pew research center, the largest religion in the US is Christianity, claimed by the majority of the population (71% in 2014) (2015). From those queried, roughly 46.5% of Americans are Protestants, 25.4% are Catholics, 2% are Mormons (the name commonly used to refer to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), and 1% have affiliations with various other Christian denominations (2015). Different religion may have different dogma about sex. Ludger H. Viefhues-Bailey wrote sex was designed for becoming one as instructed in Genesis 2: 24 and referred to again in I Corinthians 6: 16 and Ephesians 5:31, because vibrator can interfere with your ability to learn to respond to him [sic] touch, we do not recommend the vibrator as the way to learn to be orgasmic (2012). Many people who do not believe in religion may not think in this way. Therefore, religion can be an important factor that result in our different opinion toward sexuality. 
Moreover, our attitude toward sex can result from our society. Because of society norms, sometimes we seems to link marriage and love too closely, and many Chinese think once two young people have sex, they should consider marriage. But in America, many people consider marriage and love separately. I had interview serval American students, they told me they will not consider marriage or build a relationship after sex. As I mentioned before, America is a country that pursue freedom so much. In Americans' family, most parents do not discipline their children as much as Chinese parents do. This could also result from ""one child policy"" in China. Which said ""one couple (including legally adopted) after the birth of a child is no longer allowed give birth anymore child. Zhang et al said in ""where do Chinese adolescents obtain knowledge of sex? Implications for sex education in China"", Chinese parents are more conservative toward sexuality results from culture norms (2007). Chinese parents more likely to install some ideas about conservative sexuality to their children. 
Some people may mention sex education is the most important factor that caused Chinese and Americans have different attitude toward sex. They claim this point because sex education situation in two countries has difference and education is the way how people form their concept. While, I admit that sex education in China maybe not as widespread as in America. But in nowadays, the difference is reducing. According to Wikipedia, Chinese sex education have been developed since 2010, after the compulsory education biology textbooks are a lot of supplemental educational content, in many cities of the school has set up a ""physical health class."" While many sites have begun the development of education, like the shell Network's intellectual and so on. 
Conclusion 
Finally, as I mentioned before, there are many factors that could influence how we think about sex. Different kinds of sex education and how much we learned from sex education can influence Americans and Chinese' opinion toward sex differently, but sex education is not the crucial reason to determine why Americans and Chinese value sex differently. Thus sex education is not the fundamental reason to explain why Chinese and Americans have different opinion toward sex.

"One Child Policy in China
Nowadays, the population growth is one of the serious problems in China today. Because the China already has more than 1. 3 billion people, the population growth causes not only, urban and traffic to increase but also a decrease in energy supply. In response, the Chinese government uses the One Child Policy to control the population growth. This policy was launched in 1980. The One Child Policy means ""Communist Youth League members can just have only one child, in a bid for improving the living standard"" (Xinhua News Agency, 2010). And this policy means each family can only have one child. Also, it promotes late marriage, late births and using the birth control pills to solve the population growth problem. However, some people disagree with this policy and they hold that having children is their own choice. The One Child Policy in China is not a new argument. And, the One Child Policy causes gender imbalance, problems for the elderly, and quality of new births. But, if the Chinese government doesn't use the One Child Policy to control the increasing population, this will affect the quality of people's living standard when the population exceeds the required subsistence production rate. Therefore, the One Child Policy is not only conducive to the health of humans and the job market, but it is also related to economics. So, those people should follow the One Child Policy and use this policy in people's life, because the government uses the One Child Policy to decrease population and control the population growth and it is benefit for China.
The One Child Policy really has helps for China, this policy helps China decreased more people also which is means help China reduce lots of stress. ""The 1- child policy has prevented 400 million births in the world's most populous country, the Chinese newspaper Global Times reported"" (UPI News Track, 2010). The China already prevented 400 million births when used One Child Policy and it is most in the world's populous country. This is report is a good evidence for prove the One Child Policy is better choice to control population growth.
After use One Child Policy, the China really has huge change. Because China has a large population for lots of years, it is already a big problem for China's development and people's living standard, so the Chinese government should use the One Child Policy to control population growth. This is government's way of improving people's lives. After using the One Child Policy, people's life expectancy grew: ""When this policy was launched, China had largely improved, and the average life expectancy in China has surpassed 73 years, equivalent to the level of a moderately developed country"" (Xinhua News Agency, 2010). This means people's living standard has already been enhanced. Also, the people's education has been extended: ""People over 15 years of age received 4. 5 years of education on the average in the late 1970s. Now, they receive 8. 5 years of education"" (Xinhua News Agency, 2010). This means children can study more years which is a good way for people, so the One Child Policy allows children to have a better education.
From other perspective, after use the One Child Policy, there has been decrease in poor people, according to the author, ""the One Child Policy has helped millions of Chinese come out of poverty. 30 years ago, 250 million people were in poverty, today there are 15 million"" (Xinhua News, 2008). That means after use the One Child Policy, there are many people come out of poverty, on the other side ""China 's per capita GDP reached 2,400 U.S. dollars in 2007, However, if without the policy , that figure, according to official calculations, would have been 1,800 U.S. dollars"" (Xinhua News, 2008). This explains China's GDP has increased when used the One Child Policy. From this information people should know use the One Child Policy and if do not use have totally different, so government really need this policy to control national conditions, and if everybody abide by this policy very well, then the China will develop very fast, also people will have a better living standard than before, so people should support the One Child Policy.
The population growth will also cause environmental pollution. The population growth causes the environmental degradation. ""More people mean less forest, water, soil, and other natural resources, but more waste, pollution, and greenhouse gases"" (Knol, 2009). It shows people already felt the environment pollution is a problem for everybody, the forest, water, soil and other resources are decreased, and the pollution are rising gradually. Because of the population growth, industrial, urban and traffic pollution will sharply increase and this is the cause of arable land decreasing. While at the same time, people's demands for food will also increase. Because of the food supply, people need more arable land to plant the food. However, ""The circular link between poverty and environment is an extremely complex phenomenon"" (Knol, 2009). This is true phenomenon, these two things has really closed relationship because the poverty and environment will lead to effect with each others. There is critical link between these factors, and if these two things are not balance, there will be problems.
In addition, inappropriate land reclamation will destroy the ecological balance, resulting in land desertification, soil sanitization and so on. In recent years, with population growth and consumption level, there is a rapid increase in energy consumption. The energy may be used up in the short term and at the same time, it will also increase environmental pollution problems, such as the burning of production and life fuels, also ""depleting water sources, receding underground water tables, pollution of rivers and lakes, desertification, accelerating extinction of species, rising emission of greenhouse gases and fast disappearing natural resources. All these are obstacles to economic development and environmental protection"" (China daily, 2010). Above theses problems will influence national development and people's life. People must take into account about environment problem and need to bring into effect. However, the One Child Policy will help to control the population growth and lighten the impact on environmental pollution.
The population growth will also cause the social problems such as unemployment and poverty. ""Lack of opportunities for gainful employment in villages and the ecological stresses is leading to an ever-increasing movement of poor families to towns""(Konl, 2010). Some people in villages do not have job so they are forces to move to cities. The job stresses in the city will increase. Population growth will decrease average mineral resources and purchasing power and this is the reason for unemployment. ""Inequality may foster unsustainability because the poor, who rely on natural resources more than the rich, deplete natural resources faster as they have no real prospects of gaining access to other types of resources""(Konl, 2010).
People who cannot find a job to support their families may cause divorce problems. The level of unemployment will cause reduction in people's quality of life so that people will not have financial protection, then the development of soicety can not improve any more. So the One Child Policy is only one way to control population growth and ensure people have better living standard, ""Let's see what the benefits of the two objectives are. First, a decreased population would ensure higher average personal income. Second, it would help improve the environment, guaranteeing people a better quality of life"" (China daily, 2010). Therefore, there will be a increase in national income, social spending and the companies can expand production. Therefore the One child policy will be the best solving for these problems and even increasing the national income.
Otherwise, the gradual rise of world population lead to the food supply is not enough, ""Before the 1970s only 10 countries produced more food than they consumed. Within two decades of a new breed of modified crops being introduced, global food supply had doubled. But population growth failed to keep up"" ( Peak oil News, 2010). This problem is really important, because if the food supply can not continue, then the world will be deep in crisis. So people really need to concern this problem which is bringing some trouble to people's life.
Another disadvantage of the One Child Policy is the age-old problem. This will decrease the labor force and also decrease benefits. ""Because of the One Child Policy, there are more people who will be older in the future, so China's elderly care services face big pressure in coming years"" (China daily, 2010). Part of problem for the elderly is their lack of child care and life has become difficult because the body is no longer as in youth and they develop more health problems. Violent beatings, abandonment and even killing will happen to those old people. Some young people in this society do not give way to the old people and even treat them badly. Another problem is the One Child Policy leads to gender imbalance, because after used One Child Policy, it has big influence for gender balance, ""In place since 1979, the "" one child "" rule has prompted many Chinese to practice sex selection, using ultrasound screenings to determine whether the fetus is a boy or girl and then aborting females or abandoning them after birth to orphanages. More than 35,000 forced abortions were performed in China each day in 2009"" (Artemisia, 2010). This explain the parents want to son in China, but when the One Child Policy launched, they could not have more choice, so using ultrasound screenings to determine the fetus is a boy or girl, if a girl the parents will abandoning them. So there were lots of forced abortions performed each day in China. And also the number of man amounts to more than women, that means some men will not be able to get married, which is a big problem for people, ""By 2020, an estimated 35 million Chinese men will be unable to find wives"" (Kathleen E. Mc Laughlin, 2010). This report clearly show there will more men will be single and if they want find wives I think it is really difficult, so that is important issues for China.
The One Child Policy will help the government control the population growth. According to Thomas Malthus, an English philosopher from the early 19th century, ""unchecked population growth would lead to worldwide famine and disaster"" (Peakoil, 2010). If the population growth is not controlled it will cause many problems like environmental pollution, unemployment and poverty, lower living standard, and decrease the national income. However, the One Child Policy will also help to protect the environment and bring up people's living standard. This will protect people's health and ensure a happily life. So, people should support the One Child Policy and abide by this policy.

Designer Babies
Designer babies 2
The ability to create children is unethical. People should not be able to choose if a child should have a certain color eyes or hair. Designer babies is this exact thing, babies are being created to be without disease and to ""save"" their older sibling. Parents should not have the choice to decide what the child should look like or if they are meant to save their older sibling.
Background
Genetic testing is taking a persons genes and examining the genetic information that is in the persons cell (Hunt, 2005). The genetic information can then be checked for certain diseases and mutations in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of a certain person's genes. A genetic mutation is when a segment of the DNA is taken out and the pyrimidines and purines no longer fit together. In order for researchers to figure out if a child has a genetic disorder or mutation, a full view of their DNA is needed in several small pieces. The discovery of DNA as a sequence of a persons genes occurred in 1871 (Miller, 1996). In 1943 the double helix shape of DNA was discovered by Watson and Crick. A double helix shape of DNA is a coiled structure of DNA that is held together by Hydrogen bonds as seen in figure 1. DNA sequence is a full view of the pairs the pyrimidines and purines in a genetic code (Nucleotide, 2007). Pyrimidines consist of cytosine (C) and thymine (T) and purines consist of guanine (G) and adenine (A) in a DNA sequence. These phosphate groups bind pyrimidines with purines together to form a DNA double helix shape, as seen in figure 1 (Nucleotide, 2007).
Figure 1: The double helix shape of DNA.
Gel electrophoresis is a mechanism that is used to separate DNA by its molecule base, it was developed in 1970 (Miller, 1996; Biology, 2009). The gel electrophoresis test breaks apart the hydrogen bonds and then into small segments of DNA using an electrical current. There is a positive and negative side to the electrophoresis box, since all of the DNA molecules are negative they will move to the positive area. The smaller the fragment of the organism the faster the organism moves down the gel (Biology, 2009). The researcher will then look at the shorter DNA strands and run through the information in the genetic sequence. Genetic testing is usually done to pregnant women over the age of 35 to test for Down syndrome. This is because Down syndrome is more likely to occur in babies whose mothers are older than 35. Down syndrome the disease is when there is an extra chromosome on the 23rd chromosome (Miller, 1996). There are several other prenatal tests that parents can do to get a prediction of their child's risk of contracting a certain disease from birth or the mother (Hunt, 2005). The prenatal test gives a full view of the child's 23 chromosomes. A chromosome contains DNA that is the blue print for every organism in the body. One little mistake in the chromosome can mean that a child can have a disease. Genetic testing especially designer babies may be a great use of science, but designer babies should not be allowed to be done.
Designer Babies
A designer baby is a child that is created by biotechnology to meet the parents expectation (Miller, 1996). Designer babies can have a broad spectrum of different possibilities. A designer baby could mean a saviour sibling, creating a child without their parent's disease, or a child that is created with certain physical features. The saviour sibling is one kind of designer baby, that is created to save the older sibling. Through the use of the umbilical cord or the bone marrow of the saviour sibling the older sibling can be healed of a certain disease (Sheldon, 2004). The creation of a child without their parent's disease is done by taking the parent's DNA and replacing it with chemically altered DNA that does not have the mutated gene that cause the disease. Another form of designer babies and the most controversial types of designer babies is when the child can be created to have certain physical features, including a certain sex.
Saviour Sibling
Several diseases that affect children do not have cures except by receiving new tissue that matches their own. Saviour siblings is where a child can be created to have matching tissue to the sick older sibling. Through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and human leucocytes antigen(HLA) a tissue type is made that matches the older siblings needs exactly. PGD is used to select embryos carrying mutations that cause severely disabling disorders (Klitzman, 2008). HLA chooses specific embryos for implantation (Sheldon, 2004). Together these things help to create the proper tissue for the saviour sibling. Upon the birth of the saviour sibling parts of the umbilical cord is given to the older sibling and the rest is saved incase it is needed in the future. This way, another saviour child is not needed if the child gets sick again.
This might be helpful, but what if the saviour sibling does not heal the older sibling or the older child dies before the saviour sibling is born. What happens to the saviour sibling? There are endless possibilities of things that can happen to the saviour child, the older sibling, or the parents. The parents could be so upset with the child not being able to save the older sibling that the child is neglected and even possibly abused. No one knows what the parents will do to the child after he or she has been born no matter if the older sibling is saved or not. A parent could even kill the saviour child. They could be good people that just let their emotions take control of them. Also, what about the emotional state of the saviour sibling when they know that they were created to save the older sibling and not for love. The child will have so many problems. Imagine how he/she will feel about the older sibling that is loved for being themselves, where as the saviour sibling is loved for their tissue or blood. Children should never grow up feeling like they are only there to be of service to the older sibling and parents wishes for the older sibling. Parents have no right to play God. A parent should never be able to choose if their child should be created to save another child or not.
A Child without Disease
Besides a designer baby being a saviour sibling, a designer baby can also be incapable of contracting certain genes (Hunt, 2005). Parents who have a certain disease or know that they are a carrier for a certain disease can rest assured that their child will be immune to this disease. Chromosomes from the parents are taken and the genes are separated in to specific lengths. The separate genes are then stained and looked at under a microscope. The genes with specific mutations are removed then the chromosomes that have not been removed are placed into the embryo (Sheldon, 2004). In Nigeria, researchers are trying to give children a chance to be born without malaria (Ajayi, 2008). A parent could even choose the child's sex in order to not contract a specific disease that comes from a sex-linked gene that one of the parents have (The Fertility Institute, 2009). The parents will no longer have to worry about if they are transmitting their disease to their child.
Even though children born without a disease is a wonderful thing, there are always other ways. Researchers are currently working on a cure for certain diseases while the child is still in the womb (Miller, 1996). A child could be cured of a disease before birth, instead of being created without the disease. Parents have another way to save their child from a disease without having to create a child in a laboratory. Creating a child in a laboratory is dangerous. Genes are very delicate and can easily be mutated and damaged. Instead of the child being created without a disease, they could be given extra mutations creating even more problems. Mutation creates a broad range of problems from physical deformities to diseases. To put this in a different point of view, think of the book Frankenstein. Even though this book is fictional, Frankenstein created a monster when he really intended to just make a regular human being. The book portrays it differently then the movie, but something went wrong in the creation and a monster was created. This is a possibility of something that could happen when creating a child. He had every good intention, but things can go wrong. No one is perfect. Do people really want to put the creation of a child in a person who is not perfect? There is so many mistakes that can be made when leaving creation of a very delicate things to researchers. The example of the monster from Frankenstein may be a bit drastic, but something close to that can happen. There are endless possibilities of deformities that can happen.
Looks
A designer baby can also be made to look a certain way. Parents can choose what they want their child to look like. For instance, the mother could want a daughter with blue eyes and brown hair. The mother wanted this so that she could have a girl in the family, because her other children are all boys with blond hair and brown eyes. Also a parent could want a child that looks exactly like them. The options are endless when it comes to what the child could look like.
There is nothing wrong with genetic testing, but creating a child to be ""perfect"" is unethical. Genetic testing can discover a disease in a child and can be given medicine while still in the womb (Miller, 1996) A child should mean the world to someone not something made in a laboratory.
On a different note, this makes people Hitler's in a way. He wanted everyone to look a certain way and now people are doing that exact thing. Several people think what Hitler did was awful, yet they are pretty much willing to do the exact same thing with their own child. Do we really need everyone to look the same? Everyone is unique in their own way and that is what makes them, who they are. Why should children have to all look the same? Will parents not be able to tell apart their own children?
Court Cases in other Countries about Designer Babies
The United Kingdom (UK) and Wales have already had trials on the concept of designer babies and whether it should be legal. In April of 2003, the UK decided that saviour siblings should be allowed, as long as genetic counseling was done to insure that the parents were doing this for the right reasons (Dyer, 2003). Then in Wales a jury of 16 teenagers ranging from the age 16-19 did a citizens court case about designer babies (Iredale, 2006). The outcome of the trial was the same as the trial in the UK. Twelve out of fourteen people agreed that people should be allowed to create saviour siblings as long as it is not for chivalrous reasons and would be useful to society (Iredale, 2006).
Other countries may have already had court cases, but that does not mean a thing. Both court cases allowed saviour siblings and designer babies to be created as long as it was not for chivalrous reasons. How are people suppose to know if the parents are creating a child for chivalrous reasons or not? People that are really dedicated to certain things can pretend to not wanting to create a child for chivalrous reasons.
Genetic testing in a prenatal stage is okay, but creating a child is unethical. Human beings are playing the role of God. Parents and researchers should not have the right to decide what a child should look like or even their disease. Also, a saviour sibling might be a good invention, but no one knows what will happen to both the saviour child or the child that needs saving. If an outcome happens to not be positive the saviour child could be severely punished for it. The saviour sibling could be neglected, abused, or even worse killed. Parents are made murderers when they may not even mean to, they just let there emotions over take them. Do we want the United States to be full of ""gods"" and murderers?

Argumentation of Waley's The Book of Songs 
The submitted proposal, interview, and synthesis paper have gathered evidence concerning the value of Arthur Waley's original English translation of Shijing, which is titled The Book of Songs. It is important to note that Waley abandoned the traditional order of Shijing using the structure based on subject matters. His literal translation lacked attention to syntax and diction and contained 290 poems omitting 15 classical political laments. Moreover, according to Raft (2012), the author replaced Chinese poetic language with mimetic form and prose sense considering the ""limits"" of the former as a ""justification"" to impose the said translation techniques (p. 122). To this end, there are a number of differences between Waley's book and original Shijing. Nonetheless, one can claim that ""The Book of Songs"" has a unique intellectual and aesthetic value. In particular, Waley was capable of conveying the complex meaning of Shijing to the general reader with a suitable death and natural sounding voice. He was one of the scholars who initiated and inspired the English tradition of scientific studies of Chinese classics, including Shijing. Furthermore, his interpretation notes and comparative anthropological analysis contributed to the objective inter-cultural philological knowledge of the text. 
First, one should point to the phenomenon of a specific culture and philosophy of translation. It manifests itself in a variety of things ranging from the focus on a specific audience to the careful presentation of the text taking into account the design of footnotes and comments to satisfy the expectations of the targeted readers. In this sense, although Schaberg (1999) claimed that Waley's translation remained interesting for scholars, teachers, and casual readers, one should take into account the presence of other, including more academically profound, English translations and interpretations of Shijing. At the same time, one should consider the originality Waley's approach to grouping sections of the book from the point of view of his goal to convey its meaning to a wide audience of readers. Apparently, many parts of The Book of Songs do not strictly match the original. Nevertheless, the author's intention was to create a text that can overcome the cross-cultural gap and to introduce a version of Shijing that could really attract the general reader to the text of the poem and the early Chinese culture at large. Moreover, the text has a fairly universal interpretive depth and is not content with merely delivering the meaning of a certain limited aspect, such as the attitude of the Chinese people towards the stories Shijing in a certain historical period. One can claim that the author coped with this task brilliantly thanks to his unique approach to the presentation of poetry in translation and extraordinary poetic talent. In this sense, The Book of Songs is the best option for the initial acquaintance with the Shijing in English. 
On the other hand, Waley was one of the first English-speaking scholars who had the goal of serious study of early Chinese culture and, in particular, Shijing. From this standpoint, it is difficult to overestimate the value of ""The Book of Songs,"" as this ""imperfect"" version inspired generations of translators and different groups of readers to further, more in-depth study of the Chinese classic texts. It should be noted that, according to Schaberg (1999), Waley remains the best-selling contemporary sinologist. Thus, the author has managed to overcome the most serious misconceptions inherent in his generation of scientists in relation to the Chinese literary works. At the same time, he shared some of their misconceptions about Chinese poetry. To this end, according to the remark of Raft (2012), Waley failed to consider the merits of the Chinese poetic language focusing primarily certain ""narrative"" of the poems, and aiming to translate what the latter were saying rather than how (p. 127). 
Finally, Waley's interpretation contributed to the overall inter-cultural commentarial tradition of Shijing. According to Lin (2015), it is impossible to exhaust the rich philosophical, historical, anthropological, and religious meanings of the discussed text. However, Waley was able to present the critical in-depth interpretation of the unsullied Shijing applying his own powerful historical worldview and various anthropological, philological, and poetic recourses. To this end, the author made valuable efforts to objectively unravel the enigma of Shijing, which makes ""The Book of Songs"" interesting for both Chinese and English scholars. 
Thus, one can claim that Shijing is a complex text comprising various hermeneutic aspects. It includes the text's original meaning, commentarial tradition, the attitude of particular readers, and the specific cultural role in certain historical period. To this end, the paper has suggested that Waley's ""The Book of Songs,"" despite its differences from the original, has a unique intellectual and aesthetic value. It is suitable in depth for general audience. It was among the first English works to inspire the tradition of Chinese studies. It also contributed to solving the inter-cultural enigma of Shijing. However, it is important to consider specific limitations of Waley's translation with respect to the philosophy of translation, certain misconceptions concerning the Chinese poetry, and its academic value.

"P05D03 Argumentative Essay 
April 18, 2015. 
What Society Should Do to Improve Air Quality 
	In this era of modernism, excessive development have cause a potential threat not only to the future generation of humanity but the present generation as well. The current society is so driven to advance rapidly and their persistency to do so has led to a massive problem that is a serious threat to Mother Nature - air pollution. Air pollution is considered one of the most harmful pollution compared to other types of pollution. However, despite air pollution already being such a harmful phenomena to humans, there is only a small fraction of people working together to help reduce or improve the current situation. In order for this situation to improve, society should practice good habits to conserve whatever unharmed clean air resources that are left for the future generation. 
	The poor surrounding air quality is partly due to the extensive usage of gas-powered lawnmowers and outdoor barbeques. These activities releases harmful emissions into the surrounding environment. We should also use lower our usage our barbeque grills and convert to other healthier alternatives such as grilling or steaming. Gas-powered lawnmowers should be replaced by chargeable electric powered ones because they will emit a lot less emissions which will cause less air to be polluted in the process. According to a study led by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health, reduction in fine particulate shows an increase in life expectancy (Dominici, Dockery, & Correia, 2012). By changing our lifestyles towards the healthier alternatives stated earlier, we not only help improve air pollution, we also lengthen our years of life and lower cost of living by doing so. 
Another main reason that air pollution is on the rise is because of the increase in daily usage of transportation especially personal vehicles such as cars and motorcycles. This is because owning a personal vehicle has grown to become a necessity in the current society to get from one place to another. According to a research regarding worldwide vehicle ownership and income growth, there is an observed upward trend where vehicle ownership increased from 400 vehicles per 1000 people in the 1960's to over 800 vehicles per 1000 people in year 2002 (Dargay, Gately, & Sommer, 2007). Similar trends are also observed in the Asian and European region. The rapid increase in vehicle usage cause carbon monoxide and other hazardous toxic emissions to be released into the air and consequently humans are exposed to them. In order to overcome this problem, we should practice the habit of car-pooling and utilizing the public transportation available such as buses and trains. The demand for personal vehicles would then decrease thus the manufacturers would not produce as many vehicles. 
When the demand for personal vehicles decreases, the manufacturers would also produce less vehicles. This would also reduce the amount of factories and plants needed to produce the vehicles. This reduction in required factories and building plants for manufacturing would then reduce deforestation of a lot of rainforests. This would mean that there would be more trees to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. This would indirectly reduce air pollution and improve air quality for humans to breathe. To improve it further, trees planting known as the process of reforestation should be organized to further populate the forests. In the long-term, this can preserve the clean air for the future generation. Planting more trees can also prevent the many occurrence of soil erosion. The tree roots are strong and can help stabilize the soil in the ground 
especially during the rainy weather when water is absorbed into the ground and starts to loosen the soil (Popular Mechanics, 2013). 
	Some parties such as workers' unions may argue that the reduction of plants and factories may cause an uproar due to the possible hike in the unemployment rate. The high unemployment rate would then cause the poverty level to increase which will then decrease the standards of living for many citizens. However, these problems can be overcome by the government reintroducing recycling habits. The government can encourage active recycling habits by starting a program which rewards people for recycling their recyclable items. Following the increase in the recycling habit, there would be a higher need for the expansion of recycling centers all over the country. This expansion would then create more jobs for people in the society which will indirectly contra most of the jobs lost in the beginning. This attempt might be seen as a long-shot but given time and continuous effort between organizations and the government, it is highly likely to happen because the habit of recycling is not the introduction of an entirely new concept to the people but just merely an upgraded continuity of what has already been practiced for some time now. 
	Air pollution took a long period of time to develop and worsen. People need to know the severity of this matter if our ignorance towards the poor air quality is allowed to go on. People seem to take this matter lightly as its effects are still not jeopardizing a big part of their lives yet. But the longer we wait, the problem with our air quality will definitely take for it to be restored to its original state. To ensure that the severity of this matter does not continue, governmental and non-governmental associations as well as the general public must cohesively work together in order to improve the current air quality. It will only slow down the process if there is no cooperation between 
any of the parties involved. When we are united and driven towards the cause, we can fix the matters at hand which is air pollution and how it is deteriorating our standards of living and hopefully put in extra efforts to preserve whatever natural resources we have left.

"Homesickness isn't a kind of illness 
Is homesickness a kind of illness like a mental disease? It is true that most of people who leave their home because of working or studying may feel homesick. Due to unfamiliar environment, people may miss their home, their parents or even their favorite food. If the homesickness were heavy, they would lose weight, fail exam or give up working or studying abroad. Therefore, many people think that homesickness is an illness because homesickness is the root cause of such illness or troubles. In my opinion, Homesickness is a common phenomenon in our society. It is not a kind of illness but a special emotion. 
Homesickness is an ordinary situation. 
Homesickness is an experience. 
People do not need to have medicine or ask for doctors.

"Should High Schools Distribute Condoms?
STDs are common among young people. One in four new STDs occurs in teenagers (Facts You Should Know About Sexual Transmitted Disease and Staying Healthy). Fifty-six percent of teenagers 12 to 17 years of age think STDs are a big problem for people their age (Facts You Should Know About Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Staying Healthy). If High Schools were to distribute condoms it would help these STDs rate decrease. With all these new STDs occurring, High Schools have started to use programs that make condoms available to them. Since Students may lack the information they need to know about these STD rates and condom use and how to properly use them, open their minds up to asking question, these programs can help the students learn more about them.
Condoms are an effective method of protection. There are two types of condoms, latex and polyurethane. The best type of condoms to use would be the ones made with latex because these condoms prevent the spread of STDs. Latex condoms are highly effective barriers to HIV when used correctly. Latex condoms are more reliable. They can only be used with water based lubricants. If used correctly the likelihood of breakage is very small. The other type of condom is polyurethane which is made of a type of plastic. They are thinner than latex so they increase sensitivity and are more agreeable in feel and appearance to some users. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines consistent use of condoms as using a condom at every act of sexual intercourse. Correct use means using undamaged, unexpired condoms, using only water-based lubricants, careful opening of the package, correct placement and use throughout intercourse, and correct removal of the condom after ejaculation. Most breakage occurs due to incorrect use. Studies of condoms in the U.S. have shown less than a 2 percent breakage rate. A study of 123 couples where one partner had HIV, and the other did not (sero-discordant couples) found that none of the uninfected partners who reported consistent condom use during the study became infected.
A study of New York's City school condom availability program found a significant increase in condom use among sexually activity students but no increase in sexual activity. A World Health Organization Review of students on sexuality education found that access to counseling and contraceptive services did not encourage earlier or increased sexual activity. There are many different ways the students could get access to the condoms. Some ways are by the school nurse, teachers, councilors, health workers, principals, bowls or baskets, vending machines, and students. 10 percent of students with condom availability programs, students may receive counseling. Some of the schools, make counseling mandatory for condom receipt. Counseling commonly includes information on abstinence, instruction on proper storage, and use of condoms and sometimes a demonstration on using condoms. In 1993 New York City surveyed parents of public high schools and found that 69 percent stated that they should have access to condoms in schools. In 1992 Gallup poll found that 68 percent of adults surveyed that condoms should be available in the schools. A separate survey of high school seniors showed 81 percent agreed. In 1995 of Denver high school students, 85 percent supported condom availability in their school (Douglas, Kirby.) With all these surveys it shows that most students would prefer to have condoms available.
A high school in the Los Angeles County uses the condom availability program. The program began in April of 1992. The students took a survey before the program started and were asked many questions. One of the questions was if they have had sexual intercourse. It was reported that 52 percent of males and 48 percent of females have. They program gave out plastic bags with 2 condoms and a note saying ""condoms are not 100% effective in preventing AIDs/HIV, sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy during sexual intercourse. Abstinence Is! Not all teenagers are sexually active. Think before you act. The consequences may be for a life time."" (Douglas, Kirby) During the first year of the program between 1,800 to 2,000 condom bags were taken. After a year of using the programs the students took another survey asking them the same questions. And it was reported that 50 percent of both male and females had sexual intercourse since the program (Douglas, Kirby.) by seeing the results of the program, you can see that having condoms available to students it does not increase their sexual behavior.
There were some researchers that used the sampling from the 1995 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey to obtain a sample of students enrolled in high schools. They randomly recruited 4,166 students completed an anonymous survey that asked them about HIV/AIDs education they have received in school, and their sexual behavior, including how many partners they have had and if they used a condom. There were 21 percent of students who had condoms available to them and 79 percent who did not have the program. 72 percent of sexually active participants in schools with condom availability programs reported using condoms the last time they had intercourse compared to the 56 percent of sexually active participants in schools without condom availability programs. The researchers determined that participants in schools with condom availability programs received greater range of HIV/AIDs and condom instruction education then participants in schools without condom availability programs. This is important because it shows that when students receive information about HIV/AIDs or STDs they know more and want to use condoms. Making condoms available in high schools would help reduce the HIV/AIDs and STD rate.
If condoms were available to students it would help them feel more comfortable. They could have a more open mind knowing there are people to talk to and can get their questions answered. Some students may feel too embarrassed to go to the store and purchase condoms. If they are trying to buy them in the store they may feel like they are being singled out or judged. By having the programs in schools it does not pertain to one student as it would at a store but rather as a whole. Students can feel more comfortable knowing there are not the only ones needing condoms. It could be possible that if they feel too embarrassed to buy them in the store that they might not use one at all. If they don't use one at all they are giving themselves that much higher of a risk or catching an STD. Having the students get the condoms at school it makes them feel like they have more privacy when the can ask their nurse or teacher, etc.
Although some people may think that distributing condoms is a good thing there are also some people who may have a different opinion. Distributing condoms in high schools can lead to students thinking having sex is okay. There are many different high schools that distribute condoms. IN a study conducted by the Allen Guttmacher Institute in April 1999, researchers found that 106 out of every 10,000 females between the ages of 15-19 years old had been pregnant, had had a miscarriage, or had an abortion within the previous years. (Lawrence, Harvey) By having the programs distribute the condoms some people may think that it will lead to more females getting pregnant or having abortions.
There are many different reasons why condoms should not be distributed. One reason would be the cost. If the high schools have to purchase the condoms it would eventually add up and cost too much throughout the years. The school would be promoting kids to have sex even though it is safe sex and the best way to prevent pregnancies is abstinence (Lawrence, Harvey). It could also be a potential offense to religious/groups and be forced to financially support a program they consider morally objectionable (Lawrence, Harvey). If over all sexual activity increases as the result of encouraging ""safe sex"" the number of people occasionally engaging in risky behavior will increase and the risk of these problems spreading will increase with it (Minch, Dr. Kevin J).
With the debates on distributing condoms, it is starting to lead to parents getting the school system involved to get rid of condom availability in their children's school. They cite such reasons as the fundamental right to remain free from governmental interference with the child rearing, their rights to familial privacy, parental liberty, and religious freedom. Some decisions that the schools made were to allow the availability of condoms but also allowing parents to request that their child not be able to receive condoms. The decision on having condoms available to the students is based on what the administration decides (Reising, Michelle.)
In conclusion, condoms should be available in high schools. The main reasons they should be available is because it promotes safe sex. It helps reduce the risks of STDs. The high schools have programs they use which help students learn more about condoms. The students can learn about what types there are and which are right for them. It also gives them more information and help students open up to ask to ask more questions. Students can feel less embarrassed and feel more comfortable getting the condoms. The programs have proven that distributing condoms do no increase sexual activity. There have been many researches done that have proven that having condoms are successful when distributed in high schools. It lowers the STD rates and prevents students from getting pregnant. Although there are many reasons as to why they should not be available but overall distributing condoms is very successful.

"Maintaining Rights 8
Maintaining Voting Rights:
An Argument Against Compulsory Voting
Carlie Schlittenhart
Northern Arizona University
Since the United States of America was established as a country in 1776, this country and its people have advocated hard work and freedom of choice. Though the right to vote was given to ""all citizens of the United States,"" achieving equal of voting rights for everyone was quite an affair. Only with the establishment of the 14th amendment, was every man regardless of race, given the absolute right to vote. 52 years later with the 19th, no woman could be rejected her right to vote. In 1971, the 26th amendment gave all citizens ages 18 and older their right. Since equal voting rights have been so difficult to achieve, Americans have been struggling virtually since the foundation of the United States to ensure them. Even with the extraordinary amount of work exerted by previous generations to achieve voting rights, many Americans choose not to. This has allowed for a controversy to arise.
Some believe that establishing compulsory voting would be beneficial to this country, while others assert that it is an infringement on their rights. Whether or not it is an educated choice to exclude themselves, Americans deserve the right to decide. Not only do voting rights affect the outcome of elections, but they symbolize the importance of democracy, a trait this nation prides itself on.
The founding fathers that wrote the Constitution, adopted in 1787, intended for citizens of the United States to possess greater freedoms than those in their former country. The Constitution states in the first amendment, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances"" (Cornell University).
The foundation of the United States as a country was based on obtaining freedoms from its mother colony, Britain. Although the colonies were separate from England, the citizens of the colonies had no control over the decisions that were being made affecting them. That is the reason for the division from England. Once the United States received its independence, and established a Constitution, freedoms were ensured for Americans. Every American is given the right to vote, and many who refrain from voting are unknowledgeable in regards to politics, or choose not to vote for political reasons. In an article published by New York Amsterdam News, 16 year old Ginsburg says, ""I think voting has never really accomplished much of anything. If people want to vote I don't have a problem with it. I don't think it's wrong to vote"" (America Speaks, 2004). When Ginsburg reaches the age of majority where it is legal for him to participate in elections, he likely will refrain from voting. These nonvoters should not be forced to vote, when the Americans that do vote care about the outcome of elections.
There are five major reasons why voting should remain a sacred right, not a legal obligation as suggested by some. The first reason being to respect the rights of citizens who choose not to cast a ballot based either on ideologies they have, or because they cannot agree with the platform of a candidate. Second, it would be ineffective due to the type of government the United States always possessed. It might also spark resentment of the government and demean voting, by the transformation of a right into an requirement. Fourth, the obligation would skew election results by forcing ignorant and uninformed Americans to cast a vote. Lastly, because voting has been a right since the birth of this country, making it compulsory would break tradition and contradict the ideals that are so highly valued in this country. Essentially, the application of compulsory voting in The United States would prove to be oxymoronic.
In every presidential election, there are two major candidates who affiliate themselves with the two most prominent parties in American politics. Often, the platforms of these rival candidates choose opposite sides of key issues such as economics, health care, the environment, etc. Other times, as has been shown in more recent elections, the candidates take similar stances on many key issues, which is a cause of confusion in selecting a candidate to vote for. While some voters are loyal to a specific party, other voters choose to vote for the candidate who supports the majority of their personal beliefs on policy.
For example, in the case of many Catholic voters, an issue resulting in the final decision of their choice of candidate has been abortion. Since many sectors of the Christian church urge its followers to side with candidates who are pro-life, that has been a trend among Catholic voters. ""For some, one remedy to the complexity of political life is to vote according to one major issue (recently the issue most associated with Catholics has been abortion) There are a whole host of other issues connected with the ""one"" that was thought to stand alone... It is this very situation that has left many Catholics politically homeless"" (Daley, 2004). Because of this moral contradiction several voters experience, there is often a belief that refraining from voting is the best decision. Citizens who choose not to vote are not necessarily conflicted or confused, but could be busy or lack interest in policy.
The percentage of registered voters who said the reason they did not vote in 2004 because they were too busy or had conflicting work or school schedules was 20%; this was the most common reason given for not voting (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). With the enactment of compulsory voting, those 20% of registered Americans would be fined for their busy schedules. Another reason for declining to vote is the belief that voting will not make a difference in either politics or the administration of the country. In an interview, Frank Ferdind, a retired pilot stated: ""I have a friend on the Committee of Ways and Means in the House,* and I've seen inside of politics because of him. I stopped voting a long time ago, because I know that it doesn't make the slightest difference,"" (2009). Mr. Ferdind would clearly be upset if voting was made a legal obligation, although he does possess a vast knowledge of politics.
Whether or not Americans choose to vote in a given election is dependent on many things. In a study performed by a group of economists, both incumbency and the state of the economy were linked with voter turnouts. ""As institutional requirements change the character of the incumbent candidacy, from an elected president to an untried first-timer, economic voting changes in emphasis from retrospective to prospective"" (Nadeau & Lewis-Beck, 2001). The correlation that the economists found is that Americans are more likely to vote in an election where and incumbent* is running for a second term and the economy is in good shape. The decision to vote is based on so many factors, and
The last group of nonvoters is compiled of those who are apathetic or unknowledgeable. They reside among the 36% of those who did not vote in the 2004 election. The point is that voting is a choice, and should remain one. Because every individual in the United States has a choice of whether or not they will vote in any given election, that right could not be taken away without consequences and most likely, failure. Revocation of this right would withdraw the voice of many through voting. Whether or not a citizen has a valid reason to refrain from voting, it is imperative that the choice remains their own.
It is a fact that many countries in the world successfully utilize compulsory voting. The success however is measured by voter turnout. In Australia, the rate of voter turnout in 2007 was approximately 95%, which is significantly higher than America's 64% in 2004 (Australian Commission, 2007). What is ignored when considering this number a success is the percentage of Australians who were ignorant of the candidate's platforms, and the type of government that controls the Australian people. Australia is ruled by a federal monarchy under a parliamentary democracy. This type of government clearly differentiates from America's democracy, as does the history and establishment of Australia. This evident success in Australia is incomparable to the United States because the types of government are completely different.
The ideals that accompany democracy in this country are far different from that of many others. Even if a legal obligation to vote was enforced, there is a high risk that it would fail. Basing a political system on another country is an incredibly difficult task. For example, Iraq has recently changed its form of government to a democracy. The reason this is so complicated is reliant on the combination of culture and change. The residents of the country have experienced thousands of years of another culture and government entirely different from America's. This change would be unnecessary and ineffective.
Not only would the shift from a right to a legal obligation be difficult for the population to adjust to, but require a great deal of effort and may provoke government resentment. One theoretical benefit of compulsory voting is the political involvement that will begin to take place among the American people. With the newly acquired involvement from previous nonvoters, there is an opportunity for raising support of the government. Lack of government support has been increasingly evident over the last decade, and advocates of transformation of the right to vote in hopes of reversal (Ruggles, 2008). However, government resentment rather than support will likely occur among two key groups of Americans. The two groups being those who respect voting as a right, those who refrain from voting for political reasons, and those who do not vote due to apathy and/or lack of awareness. Compulsory voting becomes a burden, and is often an inconvenience, especially to those newly forced to vote.
Compulsory voting will diminish the value of a vote. Equal voting rights have not always been available to all citizens of the United States. The obligation of voting would make voting less meaningful in the cases of Americans who appreciate and respect those who fought to achieve the voting rights to all citizens. As noted earlier, the ability for every American to possess the right to vote is not an ancient right. Especially for citizens between the ages of 18 and 21, the right to vote is newly acquired, with the enactment of the 26th amendment being less than forty years ago.
The dilemma in making voting obligatory is transforming a right into a forced right, which leaves no choice, making it no longer a right. A right entails a choice, the right to vote means there is a decision for each citizen to make about whether or not they will participate in an election. By making voting compulsory, this ""choice"" can no longer be labeled as a choice, because it will be forced. Forced voting would be the cancellation of a right.
With obligatory voting, ignorant and disinterested individuals will be forced to vote. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the definition of ignorant is ""not having enough knowledge, understanding or information about something"" (Cambridge Dictionary). In the case of voting, ignorance applies to those uniformed about each candidate and their political platforms. For those who value the right to vote and participate in elections by becoming familiar with the candidates, will likely not appreciate ignorant individuals voting when they have the potential to take voting halfheartedly. For some apathetic citizens, casting a vote would be more of a game than a crucial shift in government authority. Ignorant votes might be based on a number of things including age, race, social status, and appearance, as opposed to voting for a candidate due to their party affiliation, campaign strategies, or political platform. It is insulting to dedicated voters to have an equal vote as someone voting solely to avoid a fine. It is already a moral duty in the minds of those who choose to vote on a regular basis. However, this duty does not apply to the morals of every American. With compulsory voting enacted, this duty will be required to attain to every individual.
The ""American dream"" can be described by two words: hard work and freedom. Growing up in public American school districts teaches children the importance of exercising rights. Teachers demonstrate the various freedoms that come with being a citizen of the United States and why it's important to respect them. Embedded in the curriculum are stories of gaining independence, the adoption of the Constitution, and various groups of minorities in the past sacrificing to acquire equal rights. It is mostly accepted that Americans are special in possessing these rights. Without the ability to exercise the right, voting would be prone to becoming less sacred through obligation. The United States of America is based on the application of rights and freedoms entitled to all peoples. The heart of this country intended by the founding fathers is freedom of choice; without the right to vote, an American tradition is being annulled.
The hypothetical reasons for instituting compulsory voting are many. It is argued that the country would benefit from obligation initially by increasing the voting population significantly. It is also argued that those unaware of candidates and their political platforms previous to the enactment would show an interest in becoming knowledgeable of these topics. In comparison to countries such as Australia it is believed that this could be enacted without a substantial degree of funding. With most of the Americans over 18 participating in elections, citizens will be more responsible for the outcome, and in turn, more supportive of the government they have chosen.
For those who want to do everything they can to advocate compulsory voting, vote. That is all that can be done by one individual, because all the other Americans in this country will continue to make their voting choice for themselves. Because that is what voting is. A choice. A right. Citizens who take an interest in politics, and choose to vote should continue to exercise that right, while those who lack knowledge of candidates can continue to refrain from voting. What it comes down to is American ideals. Traditions. Ideas. Choices. Freedoms. Making voting compulsory would be taking a right the founders of the American government deemed as sacred and making it less dignified.

"More Than Food Option, 
Fast Food Is Widely Accepted 
by Most People 
Purdue University 
Abstract 
The fast food has been developed and popular for decades that generates its own culture and spread it worldwide. However, some people consider it to blame for some serious diseases and fast-food chains also face with problems on food safety. Nowadays, people change their perspective on fast food. However, fast food is still wildly accepted by most people and customers should also take charge of their health and eat at fast-food restaurants with healthier options. Meanwhile, fast-food companies should make improvement. 
Key Words: Fast Food; Business Chains; Food Culture; Obesity. 
Introduction 
Fast food, from the literal sense, is the concept of the food that can be served quickly and often easily packaged for take-away. This pattern of food supply can date from Ancient Rome, and has developed rapidly over the past 60 years. Usually, it only takes a couple minutes to get the order at the fast-food restaurants. As people getting on the fast track of life, they can easily get satisfied to have fast food. Besides, fast food has various options with all kinds of flavors. There's a tremendously strong market for fast food. Fast-food restaurants and companies keep their products inexpensive and have spent much money and effort on advertising as well, which would be illustrated as the main factor of business marketing in the following page. 
In general, fast food is very convenient for people with busy lifestyles and fast-food business develops a strong marketing to make it more popular. But not just the options of food, fast food can also be regarded as a kind of popular culture and varies around the world. Burgers and pizza are the best-known fast food category in the US. As in UK, conventional fast food used to be renowned for fish and chip, and food from other culture also has been adopted. Crucially, it's a quite substantive and direct way of cultural exportation. Indeed, ""the United States has the largest fast food industry in the world, and American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries."" Anonymous. 2008 
Nowadays, people are changing their fast-pace lifestyles into healthier ones. However, eating patterns based on fast food would significantly increase the intake of salt and fat, which are basically the main components in it. Thus traditional fast food with high calories clearly may be unable to satisfy people who want to keep fit and slim. In general, it's a tangled condition that they prefers a healthier diet now and might not accept fast food as they used to. The changes of people's perception would also be discussed in the following page. 
The Popular Culture of Fast Food 
As automobiles became popular after World War I, ""Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant, generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet and first hamburger chain"" National Public Radio 2002 Indeed, fast food can be regarded as a significant symbol of American culture to some extent. The famous ""Uncle Sam"", Samuel Wilson, was a meat packer from Troy, New York, who supplied rations for the soldiers during the War of 1812. (Uncle Sam on Wikipedia And he was so honest and reliable, not afraid of hardship, with strong patriotism, that he has been regarded as the national symbols. The spirit of him inspired that generation. Afterwards, Harland David Sanders founded the KFC, which is one of the most famous American fast-food chains and also the second biggest fast-food company in the world. 
Fast food has different versions with growing popularity in common worldwide. And this is substantive and direct way of cultural exportation. For example, Japanese sushi has been increasingly popular and people get to know tatami and ""Omurice"", together with Japanese culture. Chinese takeaways offer a wide variety of Asian food are all the rage and it's popular to learn Chinese to order the meal. 
The fast-food-industry business has been on the model of ""low wages, non-existent benefits, and limited work hours"".( Allegretto, S., Jacobs, K., Doussard, M., Graham-Squire, D., Dan, T., & Thompson, J. 2013) In this way, the provider can keep the price inexpensive to attract more customers. And the fast-food companies do a very good job on advertising operation. There are many instances of successful business marketing. Fast-food restaurants often offer regular flavors with the occasional ""limited time"" ones and the giveaways of limited edition. For example, Mc Donalds always launches kids' meals with fancy toys to attract children and their parents as well. 
Fast-food Industry and Chains: ""Healthy"" Fast Food 
However, as the provider, fast-food companies should focus more on healthy food and offer more options besides the economic purpose. Some fast-food restaurant chains may declare that they offer healthy options but the research group has concerned the relation between fast food and diseases, so they did chemical analyses on several samples consisting of chips and fried chicken. It turns out that most food contains excessive industrially produced trans-fatty acids, the high intake of which is quite relating to the risk of obesity and may gradually leading to serious condition like type- diabetes and coronary artery disease. However, it would be improvable for fast-food chains to reduce portions to normal sizes and eliminate industrially produced trans-fat, and offer food menus with reliable nutritional labeling as well. (Stender, S., Dyerberg, J., & Astrup, A. 2007) 
Some people think fast food may have problems on food safety. Good streamlines, qualifications of employees and food processing are the basic assurance of food safety, essentially. At fast-food restaurants, most menus contain lettuce, potatoes and chicken and fast food companies bought in large quantities, so there should be some quality inspections on ingredients. Fast-food companies should have strict safety control on primary food ingredients and food processing. Besides, employees are supposed to have a basic understanding of food safety standards, which is comparatively rare in home-style or small restaurants. Because they may be family members, not trained for this system, with a relatively high turn-over. 
Although, there are public displays of fast-food chains to show people every steps of how fast food is made. It's convincing for the guarantee of food safety. Most fast-food chains, especially big famous companies, have operative measures to guarantee food safety. 
Fast food has safety problems 
Despite fast food being increasingly popular, there are still many people who blame some healthy problems like obesity on it. As for food safety, the bad events would persist and affect the way people perceive fast food. As news reported, Taco bell, one of the most famous fast-food companies, once put an emergency recall for microbiological contamination with E. coli. In contrast, chickens have some infectious diseases, so the source should be strictly controlled to make sure that chicken is safely edible. Most fast-food restaurants can deal with it well and thus 
there're few recalls of chicken products. Overall, fast-food business does have issues on food safety but so far with few outbreaks yet. 
There's an article that reviews on the relationship among fast food, energy and obesity to find out whether fast foods are linked to the epidemic of obesity. The research finding suggests that the food with high energy density would down-regulate our ability to maintain energy balance, which is called ""passive over-consumption"". And this disturbance would gradually lead to weight gaining. According to the composition data, most of fast foods have an extremely high energy density. Therefore, the high energy density of fast food would disorder appetite control systems of human bodies, and hence to cause obesity. (Prentice, A. M., & Jebb, S. A.) 
""The Western diet, characterized by large intakes of foods high in fat/sugar/sodium, red/processed meat, and refined grains, has been linked to onset of many chronic diseases including cancer."" (Bowman, S. A., Gortmaker, S. L., Ebbeling, C. B., Pereira, M. A., & Ludwig, D. S 2004) There are various substitutions to get a healthy diet, like changing for low-fat sauce. Offering food menus with reliable nutritional labelling, especially in calories, can also help customers know what they can get. 
People's Perspective on Fast Food 
People are changing their fast-pace lifestyles into healthier ones to be more productive. Thus traditional fast food with high calories clearly may be unable to satisfy people who want to keep fit and slim. People would gain weight gradually and obesity may lead to more serious conditions like cardiovascular disease eventually. And some people stop eating fast food for health. The other part of people may turn fast food down because they want to support local restaurants instead of big fast-food corporations. 
However, there are still many people who eat fast food very often and even take it as a vogue. These are the people who might work very busy or not feel like to have regular food, who would face a higher risk of health problems. In general, people favor fast food for its advantages and the tasty food. Meanwhile, it's a tangled condition that they prefers a healthier diet now and might not accept fast food as they used to. 
In fact, the dietary calories are about 2000 to 2200 calories for male and 1600 to 1800 calories a day on average. According to experiment, men and old people consume fast food more than women did. Basically people can choose a balanced diet depending on what they consumes a day. We can do some research and be aware when eating at fast-food restaurants. And the moderation is very important from her point of view. The times of having fast food should be kept as few as possible in a week. There's nothing wrong with it if you have fast food once in a while. Moreover, a healthy lifestyle is far more than what we eat. People should also work out regularly to keep fit. 
Conclusion 
Based on the successful business model and its own advantages, fast food has been very popular and accepted by most people worldwide, despite faced with many problems at the same time. And it's also the symbols of different areas and cultures. The companies are supposed to make a rebalance towards a healthier diet. In this way, fast food would be more acceptable to the general public.

"Introduction 
In a modern world we are living in right now, we can access music on-to-go and almost at everywhere. Music has existed for so long and it has been giving astounding effects on the listeners, such as making the listeners to feel good and connected to the music. As an illustration for this, many restaurants play some music to create a delightful environment for the customers to enjoy their time there. Thus, music plays an exceptionally important role in almost everyone's life, especially in students' lives. This is due to the fact that most students listen to music while they are studying and acquiring knowledge. For instance, even when I am studying or doing my homework, I prefer to do it while listening to music because it avoids me from feeling sleepy. However, I believe most of the students who have this habit do not know precisely what are the effects of listening to music while learning, including myself. Therefore, it is important to discover how music affects students' learning processes so that students can plan their learning activities better. 
The benefits of listening to music while learning 
Listening to music while learning will make the students perform better cognitively as it is thought that background music facilitates and improves cognitive performance (Angel, Polzella, & Elvers, 2010, p. 1063). Moreover, music helps the students from being distracted by any unwanted noise. Dr. Hollich stated that music makes students focus more while studying as it blocks the unwanted noise from distracting them, thus; this focusing effect will help to improve cognitive performance. However, he mentioned that music might be distracting and might disrupt the students' learning processes if they listen to it while completing a very complicated task. Besides, it is thought that students' performances were disrupted in the presence of loud music at high volumes (Dolegui, 2013, p. 2). Dr. Hollich agreed that if the volume of the music is too high especially if it exceeds 78 decibels, it will become a noise and make the body to get stressed, thus; cognitive performances of the students will be disrupted. 
Cognitive dissonance involves thinking, accruing knowledge, and making choices, which all of these causes stress. When students are studying, they will do a lot of activities that involve thinking in order to accept and understand the new knowledge that they are learning, hence these things contribute to cognitive dissonance which causes stress to the students. It is claimed that pleasant music helped to overcome the effects of cognitive dissonance as it helped the mind kept the opposing cognitions in stressful thinking (Perlovsky, A. Cabanac, Bonniot-Cabanac, & M. Cabanac, 2013, p. 6-8). Furthermore, Dr. Hollich concluded that music helps making the students feel energized. He said that music helps calm students down in stressful situations and adds the element of fun to studying. He gave an example of his son who would feel more willingly to study if there's music playing because music gives the sense of fun to studying, thus; it helps avoiding the sleepiness or boredom to come in. Music acts as a ball of energy and spreads it to the students, helping them feel energized every time they listen to the music. 
Dr. Hollich mentioned that ""context effect"" which is the environment where the students are studying might influence the memory of the things they are learning. He said, ""If you listen to the same music that you studied with while you're being tested on it, there are some evidences that you would actually remember the things you have studied better"". Also, he suggested that students can choose to listen to certain songs for each topic that they are learning, and they can listen to the songs before taking up the tests so that they can recall what they have learnt better. However, since it is well known by everyone that students cannot listen to music while taking examinations or tests, Dr. Hollich suggested that students can hum the songs in their head when they are taking the test to recall back what have learnt using this ""context effect"". It is important for the students to consider other people in the classroom too so that their humming won't disturb other people. Students can try to get the benefits from this ""context effect"" when doing their homework, too. This ""context effect"" will make it easier for the students to remember the things they have studied when they are in the same context that they studied in before. Therefore, it is important for students and educators to take advantage of these benefits of listening to music on learning processes. 
Suggestions to take advantage of the benefits music gives 
As listening to music gives numerous beneficial effects to the students while studying, it is important for students to have their awareness about how music can help them. For instance, they should be aware that they shouldn't be listening to music while learning a very complicated material or listening to the music at the volume level that is too high. Besides that, they should know that music can help to remember the learning materials better by using the ""context effect"", thus; they should try to implement this as a way of helping them to learn, too. Moreover, educators can also play some music in class while students are doing the uncomplicated stuffs as it will avoid the students from feeling sleepy. Educational institutions can make ""music rooms"" with different genre of music playing in each of them as many students have different taste of music. During the gap time in between classes, students can go to any ""music room"" that they prefer that day and spend their time to study or do their homework there. 
Conclusion 
	All in all, music helps in improving cognitive performances of the students as it makes students to be able to focus more on their learning activities. Besides, music boosts students' moods and reduces the pressure of studying as it gives the sense of fun to studying. Moreover, music helps to improves students' abilities to remember what they have learnt better. All of these show that music is very helpful and beneficial for the students, hence both the students and the educators should take advantage of the various favorable effects music gives.

Taking non major-related jobs is possible for graduates 
	Many graduate students are confused about their future career, because they don't know which option is better between taking major related jobs and non-major related jobs. Some people consider that students could only take the major related jobs, so that they won't waste their four years' effort in college. But actually, only 27% percent of student are taking the major related jobs (Plumer, 2013). The reason why the majority of the students having the non-major relating job are that these jobs have low requirements for them. Students could also expand their horizons of life experience, and there would be less competition for the non-major related jobs. 
	Some of college students may plan to take part time jobs in their spare time, but haven't graduated, so the non-major related part time jobs become their first option. In a survey done by Huang (2012), many responders wrote the reasons why they choose non-major related jobs. The most common answer was the requirement of non-major jobs were lower the major related ones. Huang conclude that most of the responder are full time college students, which don't have enough degree for applying high salary jobs. However, those non-major related jobs such as part time jobs or blue collar works, are more common because of low requirements. Even though students get bored about their current jobs, they could quit them anytime they want and find new one. 
	Taking non-major related jobs could offer students new things and views that they've never experienced before. The job hopping rate is high in the U.S, according to Althen (2011), in average, Americans would take 13 to 15 different jobs before age of thirty-eight. From those data, it could conclude that the most Americans are willing to try new things. And this was also confirmed by my interview subject. Scott Vana is a current students' advisor at Purdue. In the interview, he said that he had engaged at least ten different jobs, and most of the jobs were totally different from others (V. Scott, personal communication, March, 12, 2016). After he graduated from finance major, he was confused about his future path, he didn't know what to do at that time. At first, he took some jobs at a restaurant. He also used to be a restaurant manager. ""that was an easy job,"" said Scott, ""I didn't expect that I did the jobs which was unrelated to my major, but that job wasn't hard."" Soon, he moved to a new place and got married, and this time he worked as a finance teacher in community college. Scott said, ""This was the only work I had done that related to my majors."" What he felt from all these different jobs was not only the skills to deal with problems during working time, but also the skill to deal with relations between colleague. He said when he took the different jobs, he considered them as challenges, and he would try his best to do it, whether they were related to his major	 
	 For recent college graduate students, finding appropriate and high-in come jobs is hard for them because of lack of experiences and skills, which cause very high rate of unemployment among college graduated students. In Abel's research (2014), the unemployment rate goes up to 50% in 2012 and the rate of unemployment declined with the growth of students' ages. In Abel another research charts, the unemployment rate was low in the jobs like business, communications where bachelors' degrees in that major are not required (2014). So Abel conclude that even though the unemployment rate was high, students could still make a live. Taking jobs in business or some other fields, that don't require specific skills, might be students' best option. 
	But taking non-major related jobs may also have some drawbacks. On one hand, people may think that their four years' effort in college are wasted. On the other hand, taking jobs in new fields could be a challenge for students. If they don't pay attention or working hard on their position, they would be fired soon. Even though there are many challenges and troubles on taking non-major related jobs, students could still overcome them. For example, when Scott taking the new jobs, he usually focuses on the instructors' words and takes notes for the important points of the jobs. With the enough preparation, he definitely will do better than others. 
	In conclusion, I prefer taking the non-major related jobs than taking major related jobs. We shouldn't be bounded by one place and life is short. So we should try new things and see new views. By meeting different people and visiting new places, which could enrich our mental world. And it is not hard to start taking non-major related jobs, as long as we are willing to spend enough time on working. So taking non-major related jobs has more benefits than taking major related jobs.

"Argumentative Essay, Draft 1 
4/1/2016 
Argumentative Essay: 
How Opportunity Cost Plays An Important Role In Our Daily Lives 
According to Parkin (2010), who is a highly ranked professor in the department of economics from the University of Western Ontario, an opportunity cost of an event is the cost of the preeminent alternative that we must waive in order to get it - meaning that it is the loss of potential gain from an alternative when another alternative is chosen. 
Previous research concludes that consumers often fail to develop calculated alternatives in order to consider the opportunity costs of a purchase. This is because consumers are more inclined to get straight to the point rather than stipulate other possibilities. For example, according to Frederick, Novemsky, Wang, Dhar, & Nowlis (2009), ""when participants were permitted to ask questions about some opportunity (such as going to see a film in a foreign city) before deciding whether to do it, their inquiries pertained almost exclusively to the focal event rather than to possible alternatives"" (p. 554). This goes to show that people are generally not very willing to explore possibilities other than the ones already directly ahead of them. Therefore, my claim is to expose people to opportunity cost so they are more likely to make more rational decisions. 
The first counterargument is that people are social animals and so they just sometimes follow their instincts to make decisions. However, without any sort of prior knowledge, there is no way people are able to follow their instincts to make decisions. 
Another counterargument to my claim of exposing people to opportunity cost so they are more likely to make more rational decisions would be that people are inevitably using the concept, even without actual knowledge of the term 'opportunity cost'. This may be true, but surely knowing what an opportunity cost would broaden one's mind and make them think a bit more when it comes to decision making in the future. 
In conclusion, the counterclaims that I received made fair points. However, I truly believe that we should expose people to opportunity cost as they would have more of an option as to what they can decide on.

WP #5 Extended Argument
Present vs. Future
The debate over the importance and influence of music, art and physical education in grade school curriculum has long been debated and disagreed upon. For some time though the debate has become seemingly less fierce as many have accepted the positive effect these types of courses have had in shaping individuals and society. Why is it then that when money is tight and budgets are cut that these programs are immediately the first to go? It is an endless battle to keep the arts incorporated in curriculum. This issue has come home as the Flagstaff Unified School District is now going through the crisis of budget cuts and leaning towards ridding all of its schools of art, music, and physical education. These programs should not be taken away but rather the budget should be readjusted to allow them to continue right along with everything else.
On Tuesday, March 31st the FUSD governing board sent layoff or potential layoff notices to 332 staff members. This includes teachers, librarians, administrators, counselors, and psychologists working within the district. This comes to about thirty percent of its overall teaching staff. The notices were sent out as a precaution to combat the state educational budget cuts in funding (Davis). The layoff notices consisted primarily of reduction in force(RIF) notices. The RIF notices simply informed the employee that their current job is not secured for the next year and they might be let go. The potential of no action being taken and their job kept may happen also.
The precautions prepared the school district to make room for a $10. 5 million budget cut that is much higher than current estimates for the actual amount (Davis). The amount prepared for is about a 15% budget cut that is more likely to be put at around 5% (Educational Committee of AZ). The district's use of planning for the worst scenario is sloppily employed as they overestimated by three times what is being projected currently. Brainstorming workshops were not implemented until after layoff notices were sent out and could have helped plan out a less extreme plan of action for reducing the school budget for fiscal year 2010. FUSD superintendent Kevin Brown states himself that, ""We just need that flexibility"", implying the lack of planning that went into decided on what and how to make the budget cuts. A closer estimation of what was going to be lost could have been made. With the teachers currently chosen to receive RIF notices, art, music, and PE programs may be eliminated from the district's curriculum(Davis).
The decision to pinpoint art, music, and PE teachers as well as other staff members that operate in areas away from the core curriculum topics of reading and math is because these topics are viewed as disposable. Public schools are required to meet standards of reading, writing, math, and science through means of standardized testing required by the state. These state requirements are imposed by the federal government by means of the ""No Child Left Behind"" Act (Jaye). The current budget situation has led the governing board to decide on eliminating teachers covering topics not included in what the state has stressed most essential. Without teachers to cover their subject matter these seemingly elective classes will be eliminated from the curriculum.
The elective courses of music, art, and PE should not be eliminated because they are a support to core subjects. The arts are especially effective in enhancing the intellect of a person especially when studied at a young age. Studies have shown that ""Arts education facilitates language development and reading readiness"" (Hanshumaker). The emphasis of teaching reading and language arts is very important and including the arts in the curriculum will help further that endeavor. Taking away these supports will only put students who would have studied music or art at a disadvantage. They would have likely been able to perform better in English classes if they had the cooperation of an arts course. ""Arts activities foster positive attitudes toward school and result in lowered rates of absenteeism""(Hanshumaker), and ""Arts education facilitates social development, personality adjustment and general intellectual development""(Hanshumaker). The arts have also proven to encourage positive attitudes and better participation in attending classes as well as staying out of trouble. All of these factors encourage a better learning environment that then supports the entire school curriculum. All of these positive effects of music and art studies support the goals of the public education system.
With all the benefits of what art and music achieve in a child's education the lack of these classes would surely become apparent just as they are shown in studies when they are implemented. Once the course matter of these ""electives"" is no longer taught, I believe that the state regulated standardized testing will have a negative showing. If a schools testing shows lower scores from whatever bar is set or from the schools previous years this results in less educational funding. With less educational funding more cuts must be made and little or no money is available to support better education to meet state requirements. Thus, future years will probably result in lower test scores and a downward spiral in the quality of our education is created. This method of awarding high test scores with money and low test scores with less funding is a result of the ""No Child Left Behind"" Act. This act required a state implemented method of gauging school performance on select ""core"" academic curriculum rewarding schools with more or less funding in correlation with if they show achievement in learning the selected topics or falling below par. This is just one part of the Act that is important to my topic and argument.
Without previous study in music and art or participation in sports, opportunities in higher learning are diminished. Music, specifically, requires a decent background and study that can be covered in public school systems to be able to do studies at a university level. Opportunities involved with this art are completely taken away. Art, too, holds more educational studies in higher education. These courses then shape career studies and emphasis. Physical education usually leads right into sports and some student athletes get through college with grants and scholarships based upon their athletic ability that they discovered because of a previous schooling and what it offered at a young age. The core curriculum requirements help students learn what they need to function in society but electives open creative outlets and offer introductions into what they can go on to study or pursue. They also simply create a more rounded person.
The short-term goals of standardized testing and teaching to the test do not lead to the kind of people that our society should be creating. This shortsighted outlook is mostly due to poorly constructed legislature and educational tactics by the federal government but what can be controlled at a local level should be done with extreme care. A long-term outlook will benefit everyone more effectively.
Many music and sports programs function largely off of fundraising. More efforts to utilize this method could be made. The community of Flagstaff would benefit by becoming more involved with their children's activities. Grants can be applied for and taken advantage of. When teachers and student have to find means of supporting their programs this can build teamwork skills and a more invested interest in what they are doing.
The initial reaction to a budget cut was poorly organized by the FUSD governing board with the preparation of three times larger cut in funding. This upset many and has caused some teachers to pack up and look for work elsewhere before taking chances and waiting for the state to announce their educational budget plan. As soon as the RIF and non-renewal contract notices were sent out many of those on the receiving end responded. One teacher was willing to take a pay cut over eliminating any of the programs and many others might have been willing to do the same to secure their job instead of looking for a new one and a new home in a failing economy (Davis). More discussion and ideas should have been discussed before making rash decisions for ""flexibility"".
The overall organization of the handling of the districts financing is making matters more drastic. Besides the state budget reductions the school district is $5. 1 million below what they need for their 2010 school year budget. The reasons include a $1. 9 million budget override that was mistakenly not renewed, $535K lost because of lower student enrollment, $1. 5 million less in state money to cover sales tax on land and class site collections, and $1. 2 million less in state-funding for ""excess utilities."" The budget override was simply forgotten and not given an important enough status until it was remembered and left off the voter's ballot. A reserve of $4 million is going to have to be used to take care of this situation (Davis). That reserve of emergency money should have gone to the budget cuts being placed before us. Organization and priorities should be addressed in these tough times to secure the education of students. The students right now will cultivate our future and hopefully get us out of the crisis situations the economy and world are in. Great care should be placed in their education.

"Choir 
William Congreve once said:"" Music has charms to sooth a savage breast, to soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak."" Music, the best creation of human being, has its special power. It is a tool and also a gift for people in different culture to communicate. There are many forms of music performing. One can do solo; two can do duet; and a group of people can do choir. When singing in the choir, everyone combined his or her voice together and follow the lead of a director. People in the choir experience music as a team. Everyone can join a choir and many people like singing in a choir. I think the reason why many people like to join a choir is because joining a choir can benefit a person in many ways. 
Joining the choir gives a person confidence 
Joining the choir makes a person relax 
Joining the choir helps a person make friends 
Joining the choir make the person breath better 
Joining the choir boost immune system 
Joining a choir leadership 
Joining the choir makes a person feel happy

Welcome a Change, or Welcome the End
The leading scientists of the past few decades have avidly warned of the dangers of global warming. The startling realization they have recently stumbled upon is that the effects of such a situation would be much more drastic than anticipated. Stubborn skeptics often try to remain neutral in such situations by dismissing science as uncertainty, however two things remain constantly and undeniably obvious, global climate change is a serious issue, and it is caused mainly by human emissions of Carbon Dioxide (CO2).
Global warming is widely attributed to the phenomenon known as ""the greenhouse effect"". The three key components of the greenhouse effect are the earth, the surrounding atmosphere, and the sun. The sun radiates rays of heat energy which hit the earth, resulting in warmth. The majority of the heat reaching earth's surface is not absorbed however. Instead, it is radiated back towards the sun where it ceases to exist once combined with the overwhelming depths of space. The process of heat absorption and containment is due in response to the atmosphere which surrounds the earth. Particles in the atmosphere known as ""greenhouse gasses"" are much less penetrable than particles of natural gasses which make up the remaining atmosphere. Therefore, the greenhouse gasses do not allow the rays of heat to be dismissed back into space after reflecting off the earth; such as natural gasses would. Instead, they reflect the rays back towards the earth once more resulting in further heating and an increase in the overall presence of available heat energy to be absorbed by the earth.
The vast majority of the earth's atmosphere is made up of the natural gasses Oxygen and Nitrogen, which account for 99.9% of the total atmosphere (NASA.gov). This means greenhouse gasses make up less than 1% of earth's atmosphere. Therefore, because only a miniscule amount of greenhouse gasses are needed to create such a major effect on the earth's interaction with the absorption and reflection of heat radiance from the sun, even a seemingly irrelevant fluctuation of the presence of these gasses would result in a drastic change in the absorption heating of the earth.
Of the greenhouse gasses present in the earth's atmosphere, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is by far the most abundant and is steadily increasing each year. CO2 molecules in the air are taken in by photosynthetic organisms such as trees and phytoplankton. A photosynthetic organism is any organism which absorbs CO2 to produce food for itself. As these organisms take the necessary Carbon (C) out of the CO2, they are left with the byproduct of oxygen (O2), which they release back into the atmosphere. The Carbon which these organisms obtain from photosynthesis becomes part of their chemical composition; this explains why all organisms which inhabit the earth are given the title ""carbon based life-forms"". The carbon based life-forms found on land such as trees eventually die and their carbon becomes absorbed into the soil of the earth. The carbon in the earth undergoes a series of complex organic reactions in which it is then converted into coal. A virtually identical process is followed by phytoplankton in the ocean. As the phytoplankton die they sink to the ocean floor, the only difference is that the carbon from phytoplankton is converted into oil instead of coal. Oil and coal are both pure carbon. Humans then become part of the CO2 cycle as we harvest oil and coal and use it as energy for various reasons such as fuel for our automobiles. The oil and coal that is burned to create energy in cars results in the conversion of liquid or solid Carbon into Carbon in the form of a gas. When gaseous Carbon is released into the air it automatically bonds with the surrounding Oxygen (O2) to create Carbon Dioxide (CO2), completing the Carbon Dioxide cycle. At a glance this cycle seems to be a very simple and balanced equation which could continue to maintain itself indefinitely. However, the time scale ratio between the production of pure carbon and the conversion to its gaseous from by means of human emissions is astronomically asymmetrical. The processes necessary for the corpses of carbon based life-forms to be converted into oil or coal takes over 300,000,000 years, whereas its harvesting and conversion to a gaseous state in the form of CO2 takes only a few days. Because the pure carbon sources have been trapped in the earth for hundreds of millions of years, life adapted gradually to account for the relatively small amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Now that ancient carbon is being harvested and transformed into CO2 at a rapid rate, life on earth is forced to undergo significant adaptation in a very minor time frame.
Emissions of CO2 are measured in Gigatons (Gt) per year, whereas 1 Gigaton is equal to 1 Billion tons. All CO2 emissions can be distributed into three categories, Natural emissions of land based plants, organisms found in the ocean, and human sources. Annual emissions from natural sources such as plants and oceanic organisms contribute 210 Gt of CO2, whereas human emissions contribute 7 Gt. Many global warming skeptics have used these numbers in their criticisms, failing to realize a critical aspect of the equation. Because natural CO2 emitters such as trees and phytoplankton are capable of photosynthesis, they therefore must have their absorbance rates taken into account. Theses natural emitters annually absorb 213 Gt of CO2 through photosynthetic conversions, so they actually absorb 3 Gt more than they emit. Humans only emit 7 Gt, but since we are unable to undergo photosynthesis and absorb any C02, it becomes purely excess, making our net emissions greater than those of all natural forces combined. Since photosynthetic organisms in the ocean are capable of absorbing an extra 3 Gt than they emit, they are able to absorb 3 Gt of the 7Gt that humans emit annually, decreasing the direct human emissions which remain in the atmosphere to 4 Gt. The extra 3 Gt that are absorbed by oceanic organisms are not transferred into pure Carbon however. They instead remain as CO2 in the ocean. The extra oceanic absorbance of human emissions appears to many to be beneficial, however scientists disagree. Each year the extra 3 Gt of CO2 which is absorbed in the ocean continues to compound into what is now believed by NASA to be a total of 40,000 Gt. The danger associated with such a vast storage of CO2 is the fact that it is entirely unclear as to how much more can be stored before an overflow leading to detrimental repercussions, which NASA believes is becoming increasingly plausible as CO2 emissions increase as well.
The increase in the presence of CO2 in the atmosphere has led to an increase in temperature by 1 degree Celsius in the past 50 years. This may not appear to be an immediate threat, however even the smallest variable has the potential to increase exponentially in severity when occurring in a complex system such as the environment. This exponential growth is a result of what is known as ""the feedback effect"". The idea of a feedback effect is based on the theory that an event which is part of a chain of cause and effect that forms a circuit will inevitably cause the effect to effect the corresponding cause, causing each subsequent effect to become more drastic than the last. An example of a feedback effect is the deafening screech of a microphone placed near the amplifier it is plugged into. Every minor audible imperfection that is present in the range of the microphone will be sent through the amplifier and back into the microphone at an amplified volume. This process takes but a slight moment to compound an otherwise inaudible sound into a deafening screech. The feedback effect not only explains the phenomenon of compounding amplification however. The theory of feedback effects explains how something seemingly insignificant existing as an isolated variable such as minor audible imperfections in a microphone, or in the case of global warming; slight increase in temperature, soon becomes a substantial factor in creating an exponentially larger effect. It is an important aspect of the simplicity of destabilization due to minor imperfections in a complex system. The term ""global warming"" itself is misleading because it fails to address the imminent implications associated with minor change. A more appropriate term to help distinguish the actual problem would be ""global climate destabilization"". The environment can be thought of intricate machine in which every part is reliant on the other. Even the slightest imperfection in the machine has the potential to create a different effect on the part preceding it, causing the rest of the machine to once again feedback onto the slight imperfection leading to the collapse of the entire machine.
An example of a compounding variable that could easily lead to the disruption of an entire ecological machine is an increase in temperature on an important area of the North Atlantic Ocean known as the ""ocean conveyor belt"". The ocean conveyor belt is an immense oceanic current which is responsible for a vast majority of the containment of Carbon molecules in the ocean. As the current approaches England and northern Europe it beings to surge strongly downward, pulling billions of gallons of water to the ocean bed every second. As the water is pulled towards the bottom of the ocean it brings along with it many corpses of the oceanic carbon based life-forms which consist mainly of carbon. This explains how the ocean is able to maintain such a significant amount of CO2 and carbon based life-forms. The reason the water sinks is because of its salty composition which contrasts that of the waters near Northern Europe. However, a very minor increase in temperature could result in the melting of ice on land in Northern Europe, causing fresh water to flow into the ocean and dilute the salty composition of the conveyor system. If this system were to shut down, as many scientists fear may occur very soon, it would result in a feedback effect in which the carbon that would normally be sunk to the bottom of the ocean would instead remain on the surface where it could easily combine with the Oxygen in the air to create a significant increase in CO2 concentration. The increase in CO2 in the atmosphere would be far too detrimental to be reversed.
Many multinational corporations have denied all evidence suggesting the threat of global warming in order to protect their interests. The implications of climate change as a global threat would result in a severe decrease in the emissions of CO2, which are caused heavily by various multinational corporations around the world. The most avid in their attempts to disprove global warming is the multinational oil giant, Exxon Mobile, Responsible for handling more oil than most countries. If global warming is proven to be a serious threat to the environment, Exxon would face the possibility of bankruptcy because their massive investments of the pure carbon sources would be severely reduced. Exxon has avidly denied all evidence that points towards the realization of global warming , until February 13, 2007 during a World Energy conference in Houston, where Exxon's chairmen Rex Tillerson finally accepted the undeniable evidence, stating ""there is no question that the world's climate is getting warmer; the question is what to do about it"". If the largest contributor in the world to greenhouse emissions can accept the undeniable evidence supporting global warming as well as their role in it, it is absolutely implausible for modern skeptics to remain in a state of neutrality when the world is at stake
Even the Pentagon has accepted abrupt climate change as a legitimate threat to our modern way of life. In a very detailed, yet surprisingly uncensored document labeled ""An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications on United State's National Security"" states ""Abrupt climate change may cause human carrying capacity to fall below usage of the eco-system, suggesting insufficient resources leading to a contraction of the population through war, disease, and famine"". Another unsettling statement made in the document reads ""As abrupt climate change lowers the world's carrying capacity, aggressive wars are likely to be fought over food, water and energy. Deaths from war as well as starvation and disease will decrease population size, which over time, will re-balance the earth's carrying capacity"" (Pentagon 2003). This report is an intricately verbose prediction of what the leading scientists believe will happen if emissions of CO2 continue to rise at the rate in which they are now. The earth's ""carrying capacity"" is the ability in which the earth can sustain life. The report suggests a significant decrease in the amount of life that will be able to survive on earth with the increase of CO2 emissions leading to global climate change. Enough people will have to die to compensate for the drastic reduction of resources, therefore ""rebalancing the earth's carrying capacity"".
This scenario can and must be avoided at all costs. An increase in the presence of CO2 shows a relative increase in global temperatures. Therefore drastic reduction of human emissions must be carried out in order to maintain a stable temperature in which the earth can sustain life. Reduction of emissions by individuals may help slow the process of the phenomenon, but the only way for the crisis to be completely averted is for major policy changes to be made. Many groups such as Exxon and the Pentagon have accepted the threat of global climate destabilization, yet have not accepted any policy changes to account for such a crisis. The issue of global warming has recently become a topic of interest regarding politics in which the left and the right hold very different views of the situation and outcome. I cringe at the thought of a catastrophe such as that of global warming being dismissed as fiction on the basis of political standing. The reality is everyone must be advocates of change, or else we will all surely be victims of it.

"prediction of earthquake 
With over 13,000 earthquakes around the world each year having a Richter magnitude of 4. 0 or greater(wikipedia). Most of scientists believe that it is necessary to predict the earthquake before it happen, these predictions would allows the saving for both people and animal, in which, Evacuation centers and prepared. But actually, none of these predictions have been successful. When observing the earth, there have been no obvious signs that indicate the event. Scientists have noted that just before an earthquake hits vibrations can be detected, although this leaves little to no time for escape (Planet Science, n.d.). Therefore, should we predict earthquakes before it happen? After doing research of earthquakes, I totally believes that it is unnecessary to predict earthquakes before it happen, to be honest, it is unpredictable right now. 
To begin with, one of claims which support the prediction of earthquake claims that the probability of a future earthquake can be calculated, based on scientific data. scientists at the US Geological Society(USGS) were already estimated the earthquakes may occur for the next 30 years in San Francisco. ""To permit danger buildings to be evacuated, the most danger place to be cleared, and hospital and rescue teams to be prepared and on standby""(David Petley). That may allow people to prepare, and will help scientists to know the exactly date. However, scientists have no concrete evidence to prove signals of an earthquake, they may get an date like around May 2014, but they will not get an exact date. That is due to the variable of rocks, you would never know neither the exact date when it occurs nor the exact location, any prediction made would encourage people to live in fear. Therefore, the claims of the probability of future earthquakes will not give people positive effects, except fear. 
Another strongest support claims is that there were some successful perdition exist, for instance, 1975: Haicheng, China, 1985-1993: Parkfield, USA, 2009: L'Aquila, Italy (wikipedia). let's see 2009: L'Aquila, Italy (wikipedia), scientists were successful predict that the mayor of L'Aquila, Italy will have an earthquake within 24 hours, and an earthquake smaller than M 2. 3 occurred. And then, At the the same day scientists made another prediction about another huge earthquake will occur, it also successful. However, the public do not believe which had predicted by scientists, that cause more than 60000 buildings collapsed, hundreds of people died, thousands of people left homeless. Although the predictions were accurate, they did not receive positive effects, which people do not believe, and also had been muzzled by Italian government. Therefore, with thousands of earthquakes happened all around the world every year, but only very few were successful prediction. Because of the unawareness of local government and residents, Those successful prediction would be ignored. 
The strongest claim against the prediction of earthquakes is that there is not enough spare time for people to evacuate. For example, in Japan, the whole island is on the earthquake zones, the earthquake almost happen every week, the government have to improve the study of earthquakes. Therefore, Japan has the most advance equipments to predict earthquakes. However, that still could not fully protect people who live in Japan when earthquake comes, because after prediction, there may be only one minute left before it occur, the evacuate time left would be too short to escape, the damage of earthquake may finish within 20 seconds. So, the people who successful evacuate may live in the first floor, or at that time they were stay outside. It is best to learn the methods that how to survive from earthquakes other than to believe the prediction of earthquakes, you never know the exact time when it occurs. 
In conclusion, the prediction of earthquake is unreliable, and inaccurate. To compare the advantages and disadvantages that prediction of earthquake brings to us, the disadvantages is outweigh the advantages. Inaccurate prediction would make people live with fear, and when earthquake occurs, it can not reduce the damage.

"RUNNING HEAD: Independent practice for dental hygienists
Amber Morin
Northern Arizona University

Abstract
In this paper I will introduce the dental problems that Americans are facing because of a lack of available dental care, and why it is necessary to allow dental hygienists to own and operate independent practices to eliminate this problem. I will also further describe the benefits the public can gain from the introduction of independent practices. This cannot happen if individual state laws, which inhibit hygienists from opening independent practices, do not change. The regulations on independent practices need to be eliminated for the benefit and healthcare of the American people.
Many careers within specified fields offer chances of advancement for qualified professionals such as entrepreneurship opportunities, but dental hygiene does not. This occupation is controlled by state regulations, which prohibit such favorable outcomes, and which also diminishes the chance of the public benefiting from independent dental hygiene practices. The majority of the state acts have some type of supervision requirements placed upon practicing hygienists. The regulations were set in place to protect the well being of the public. However, the laws are now inhibiting dental hygienists from providing necessary healthcare where it is needed. State laws should be reformed to allow the development of independent practices for dental care and disease prevention provided by hygienists to further benefit the public in dental health, education, and accessibility. If this were to take place, it would allow hygienists to manage their own practice and deliver oral treatment and preventative care without the supervision of a licensed dentist. As it stands now, ""Colorado is the only state to allow dental hygienists to practice unsupervised. ADHA recognizes 19 states having varying forms of unsupervised practice or less restrictive supervision"" (American Dental Hygienists' Association, 2003). These varying forms still require some type of dentist supervision, whether it is direct or general, and this stalls the growth of dental hygiene as an independent profession and deprives the public of accessible and more affordable dental health care.
According to the Dental Economics magazine, the American Dental Association (ADA) reported that the nation's population is currently outpacing the number of working dentists (Pride, R. J., & Morgan, 2003). This is because the national growth rate is at 0. 975 percent (Central Intelligence Agency, 2009), which could lead to a population of four hundred million by year the 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008). Figure 1 below depicts the expected population increases described within the next forty years.

Growth rate is not the only contributing factor to the increasing population; an increased life expectancy and the current immigration issues have much to do with this problem. As of now, dentists hold an estimated one hundred and thirty-six thousand jobs nation wide (BLS, 2009). The current population is well over three hundred million, which leaves one dentist per forty thousand people. The shortage in dentists has also created a lack of hygienists and the oral disease prevention care they provide. Regulations require that hygienists must work with licensed dentists, making hygienist and dentist numbers vary directly at the same rate. If there are not a sufficient number of dentists, the same will be true for hygienists. Permitting independent practices to operate would not only fill the gap between the number of dental professionals and the population, but also increase the amount of people being educated on dental disease prevention. Dental hygienists not only focus on preventative dental disease care but on dental education as well. According to the American Dental Hygienist's Association, one part of a hygienist's job is to educate patients on proper oral hygiene techniques to maintain healthy teeth and gums and counsel them about plaque control and developing individualized at-home oral hygiene programs. By increasing the number dental hygiene practices, more people will have access to dental care and the education provided by the hygienists. Increasing the public's dental hygiene knowledge would, in turn, decrease the number of dental related diseases because at home prevention measures would be improved.
Little has been done to change state laws to allow for independent practices. This lack of available dental care has caused an increase in dental diseases, which prompted the Surgeon General's Office to release a National Call to Action to Promote Oral Health in May of 2000. The incentive behind the call to action was the prevalent oral infections detected by the studies done by the Office of the Surgeon General. Children and adolescents were, and still are, at the center of this fight for better oral health. According to the Surgeon General's report, over 50% of five to nine year olds have at least one cavity or filling (Office of Surgeon General, 2003). This number increases to 78% when children reach 17. Adults are greatly impacted by the dental care breakdown as well. Forty-eight percent of adults suffer from gingivitis, while another 22 % have periodontal disease. The graph on the next page illustrates the percentages of cavities that each age group is suffering from.
Figure 2
Thirty thousand people are diagnosed every year with throat cancer making it the sixth most common cancer in the nation. Dental hygienists are capable of detecting gingivitis, periodontal disease, and they can also identify throat cancer. Doing a thorough examination massage of the neck, in cancer prone areas, helps hygienists locate cancer. If detected early throat cancer does not result in death, but for now account for eight thousand deaths each year. If independent dental hygiene practices were available to the public, more cancers could have been detected and these numbers would not have been as significant. The results are staggering but they are just a fraction of the many oral related diseases our population is suffering from. Many other illnesses, which could be treated by a change in personal oral hygiene and nutrition, are running their courses because bad oral health inhibits individuals from making healthy lifestyle changes. The Surgeon General's Report provided modern scientific support about the links between dental health and overall health of an individual. ""On the integral relationship between oral health and general health, including recent reports of associations between chronic oral infections and diabetes, osteoporosis, heart and lung conditions, and certain adverse pregnancy outcomes"" (Office of Surgeon General, 2003). Because oral health affects the overall health of an individual, it is important to recognize the difference it can have on diseases and related mortality rates if early detection actions are taken. Dental hygienists are capable of detecting and preventing many diseases. For example, during cleanings, loose teeth can indicate osteoporosis, out of place cell growths can detect cancer, and women have an increased chance of contracting oral infections because menstruation cycle hormones are linked to gum inflammation (Web MD, 2009). This inflammation makes it hard for an individual to clean teeth thoroughly, resulting in periodontal disease, which is an infection below the gum line, and cavities. A hygienist can also identify bleeding gums, oral infections, and a high number of cavities as a sign of diabetes. If dental hygienists were allowed to practice independently many of these illnesses could be detected and treated in a timely manner, resulting in less health impact on the patients. Think of a trip to a hygienist for a checkup and cleaning as similar to taking a car to the mechanic. The mechanic will check on the noticeable problems, but during the inspection, may find the underlying issues. The same is true for dental hygienists. While their job is to educate and prevent oral diseases through regular cleanings, they are also able to identify undetected health problems.
The Surgeon General's Report about an increase in dental diseases and related illnesses prompted the ADHA to create an advanced position called an Advanced Dental Hygiene Practitioner (ADHP). The ADHP is simply a more educated hygienist. The logic behind the advanced practitioner plan is to have highly educated dental hygienists available to operate independent practices if states amend the current regulations. This strategy puts hygienists one step ahead of oppositionists of independent dental hygiene by not allowing them the opportunity to discredit hygienist's education, if laws are changed.
The ADHP is a work in progress put in place by the ADHA to also help increase the public partiality about independent practices. The ADHA is working towards more intense and longer educational curriculums that will be set in place for the degree in many colleges and universities. ""The goal is to implement the bachelor's degree as the ""entry to practice"" within five years, and for the master's degree to be the ""entry"" within 10 years after the bachelor's degree becomes the standard"" (Hershenson, R., 1989). Following these steps would make Advanced Dental Hygiene Practitioners ""professionals"" by educational standards and a more palatable idea for the public. Although the practitioner would be more educated than general hygienists the intention is not meant to undermine the general hygienist's career. General hygienists would still be able to practice under licensed dentists. The purpose of the advanced practitioner, as stated by the ADHA, is to create a more reliable dental workforce, possibly reduce the cost of dental care by offering ""advanced hygiene services,"" provide underserved areas with dental care, and work with dentists and other healthcare providers. The practitioner would meet the basic preventative oral disease needs of the patient, but they would not replace the responsibility of the general hygienist. The creation of Advanced Dental Hygiene Practitioners is the first step to gaining control of our nation's dental health problem and also shows the willingness of the ADHA to try and improve the circumstances surrounding the state of dental health care. The downfall of this program is that the plans for it are far in the future. This is currently leaving general hygienists to fight the battle for independent practice themselves, even though they are more than qualified to operate their own dental facility.
It should be known that while the ADHA is creating an advanced career option, the education of current hygienists is not to be underestimated. Those who believe that today's hygienists are not educationally qualified to operate independent practices misunderstand the standards and licensing requirements that hygienists adhere to. All hygienists must complete an associate or bachelor's degree program that is accredited by the ADHA. Upon successful completion, they must pass the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination, followed by regional or state regulation exams. Once they are certified, hygienists take examinations every few years to renew their certification. ""The hygienists said that their ''intensive'' two-year course had educated them in diagnosis and that they knew when to call in a dentist (the course covers such subjects as dental anatomy, oral pathology, histology and bacteriology, radiology and pharmacology). Hygienists said that, ""They didn't want to be dentists, because their primary interest lay in education and health maintenance and that they wanted to ''upgrade'' their profession, not weaken it by making certification easier"" (Hershenson, R., 1989). Hygienists are willing to take annual examinations and go to school for longer and more rigorous courses, yet states are still unyielding in response to hygienist's requests and the public need for independent practices.
Current hygienists and future advanced practitioners, if allowed to practice independently, would carry out preventative oral disease procedures, provide dental education, and refer patients to dentists when needed. Some of the methods to be used
include: ""Removing degenerative tissue from the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket, providing preventative measures including application of fluorides, gathering information on patient oral health, and administering a topical anesthetic when needed"" (Bailey. D., & Gail N. 1998). Because some independent practitioners may wish to make available mobile units, these services could be provided to patients who are not physically capable of going to a dentist's office. Mobile dental hygiene units are the equivalent to a traveling nurse. They would provide the majority of the services available at a hygienist's practice in the homes of people who are incapable of a trip to the office. A hygienist's office also has the potential to be less stressful than a dentist's office, making it more welcoming to many patients. The Canadian Dental Hygienist's Association has stated that, ""Clients may have reduced anxiety and less discomfort when visiting a dental hygiene clinic compared with visiting a dental office. This creates a more relaxed environment for oral care treatment."" Incorporating calming conditions in the clinics would be a benefit to the patients and attract more clientele for the practice. Attracting more patients would decrease dental diseases in the population.
Additionally, all of the services would be obtainable at inexpensive prices. Reduced prices would be due to the fact that patients are only paying the hygienists, not the dentists. In a sense, the middleman is being cut out of the payment method resulting in cheaper dental care. Earning lower level degrees take less time and money, which in most cases, results in lower salaries for the professional. Hygienists, whether required to earn a master's or associate's degree, will be going to school for a less amount of years compared to a dentist. This means cheaper and more available dental care for the public.
There is a misdistribution of dentists in impoverished and rural areas. Dental care in these areas is another benefit to the public that independent practices could offer. These regions, which are lacking in available dentists because of perceived low profits, could have readily available dental care. This in turn would help reduce some of the dental diseases our population is facing and the many illness that are associated with them. Many of these regions are also suffering from a shortage in obtainable jobs. If dental hygiene practices were granted permission to operate independently they could create jobs where they are needed most. This could help bring economic stability to families and communities that are lacking in both dental care and job opportunities. By providing dental health care in these areas there would be less illnesses and more jobs, which could stimulate local economies. A decrease in the number of illnesses could also decrease public funding spent on healthcare for poverty-stricken communities. Most people who live within impoverished areas are dependent on government programs for healthcare benefits. If there were less sick people in these areas it would reduce the number of individuals going to healthcare facilities, which could decrease funding needed for government healthcare programs. If people are employed they are more likely to acquire their own healthcare insurance rather than depending on the government for it. With less tax money going to these government programs it could go back into the hands of all Americans. This extra money could encourage spending and benefit the entire economy, which would also help strengthen local economies. If these areas had better economies and more employment opportunities, which could be provided by the hygienist's offices, they could have the potential to support a dentist's office. This would help create a balance of hygienist and dentist offices, which is necessary for hygienists to refer patients to dentists when patient's dental health calls for it.
For the wellbeing of our nation's population, it is necessary to keep independent dental hygiene practice a current issue, so that changes can be made. America is facing a shortage of dentists that is resulting in a shortage of dental hygienists, which is creating a lack of accessible dental care, education, and countless other benefits to the public. Failure to deregulate independent practices will continue to allow oral diseases and related illnesses to affect lives and hurt neighborhood's health and economic status. Without sufficient dental facilities, states could be preventing families and individuals from the early detection of fatal diseases. State laws concerning independent practices should change because dental cavities are not just decaying teeth. They are destroying the lives and futures of our population, our communities, and our nation.

Why did Atari Fail? 
Introduction 
Atari, Inc. was a successful video game company in the 1980s, and it was considered as one of the establishers which founded the video game industry in US. However, such a great company suddenly collapsed in 1984, when the video game industry crash was taking place. There were even some tales that told there were some cartridges buried under the desert in New Mexico, and recently someone dug them up and proved this tale. This even create more curiosity for people: why Atari, Inc. did it? Did Atari, Inc. do something wrong in the business, or the market led the company to the collapsing. It is obvious that the video game players are interested in this topic, but the businessmen are also interested in this topic. The businessmen specially the investors care about the market decision mistakes that Atari, Inc. might make at that time, since it was really rare for such a large incorporation to fall in a few years. 
History of Atari, Inc. and video game history in 1970s and 1980s 
	Video game industry, at that time, was still a very new and rising industry. Hundreds of the companies joined the competition in order to get their pieces of market. The early industry mainly focused in the arcade game area, and Atari, Inc. took the leader in the competition. Then later on Atari, Inc. found out that it was a great chance to develop the in-home gaming area since living room is a great place to do video game and family can spend their spare time together. 
Then Atari decided to release their first video game - Atari 2600. It was a tremendous success. According to Business Week's research (2004), the total amount that the consoles were sold was thirty million. Despite the popularity of the console, Atari 2600 was also considered as a powerful and convenient console, since it could easily transplant games from arcade to the console, and also the developers could easily develop games as they wanted on this console. (Bogost & Montfort, 2009). However, later on, because they expected their two new game, Pac-Man and E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial, to have a good market response, they made the wrong decision to use the cheap memory chips with low memory disk, and this led to the horrible performance of the game (Driscoll, 2002). This was the fuse of the Video Game Market Crash of 1983, and this issue finally led the company to collapse. 
Was it due to Atari's own wrong decision? 
Short development term 
	According to the interview (Lambie & Warshaw, 2015), Mr. Warshaw mentioned the famous failure: E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial. He said their leader asked him if he could produce a game in only five weeks. Later on they found out they were developing the E.T. game, but they had no choice but to continue. According to the interview with Tim Mc Graw (personal communication, November 2nd, 2015), he said that it was impossible to develop a marvelous game in only five weeks. 
Ruthless attitude toward employees 
Normal large companies always give the employees substitute work after the company go bankrupt or dissolve, but according to Warshaw's interview, Atari, Inc. did not do anything for their employees after it went dissolved. Also, they said bad words at employees who had left. ""We've gotten rid of all the scum."" This was what Atari, Inc.'s managers said after their first group of employees had left (Sutton, Eisenhardt & Jucker, 1986). These evidences prove that Atari, Inc. treated the employees really bad. 
Bad executives selection 
Warshaw also mentioned that their leaders could not understand the process of developing video games. ""If you plucked a manager out and put them in charge of a group of game programmers, you've got a situation where these people are smarter than their boss."" Warshaw said. In Sutton, Eisenhardt and Jucker's paper, it was said that they hired the outside supervisors who had no experience about video games. It was really bad because if managers could not understand what their employees would do, so that they could not make right decisions when they were facing some emergency status, some of them could not even give their employees right tasks to do. 
Wrong decision of the chips 
Although this mistake was a small decision of business issue, it finally became the one of the reasons that the Video Game Market Crash happened. Atari, Inc. once wanted to use the latest chips with larger memories, since it could provide more powerful performance on the Atari 2600, especially for the games such as E.T. However, in order to save cost and produce games in a faster pace, they decided to use cheaper chips with smaller memory (Driscoll, 2002). Finally, the game quality could not meet people's expectation, and a lot of cartridges could not be sold, Atari, Inc. had nothing to do but to bury most of them into New Mexico's desert. 
Was it the market's recession? 
	It was not hard to find out that the country were facing great recession at that time: the inflation went on, a lot of people lost their jobs, and people were worrying about their living and how to earn money. But that was what the public judges the economy recession. Does the entertainment really go down when there is an economy recession? We surprising find out that when we were facing the economy recession in 2008, Iron Man's Blu-ray copies were sold 500,000 in only seven days, and it broke the record of the movie disk's selling at that time (Keegan, 2008). Moreover, the public TV channels are great ways to spend people's spare time during the recession since it costs little money and people without jobs could get access to them really easy. And as the Boston Phoenix mentioned, at that time, after the video game market crash, ""after Commodore cut the retail price of the 64 to $300 in June 1983 some stores began selling it for as little as $199"" (Mitchell, 1983). This proved that home video game consoles were great ways for entertainment, since they were low-priced and could help people spend their spare time. However, Atari, Inc. still failed even they had such a large market, this must be Atari's own issues. 
Conclusion 
	Due to Atari, Inc.'s wrong market and material decisions, their unscrupulous executive decisions, and the terrible management, it was understandable why such a large company collapsed in only a few years. The leaders of companies should be quite familiar with what their employees are doing and give the precise strategies instead of just thinking about making money. Also, large companies should find ways to advance instead of depending on their old technologies or ideas. 
	It also gives modern video game industry a great lesson: this industry is very competitive, when some companies is shiftless, someone else will develop more modern and advanced consoles/video games, and they will take place them in only a few years. 
	For investors, they can study that the company with an acknowledgeable leader is more potential; the company which gets rich in a short time but has no long-term view will not last their performance forever.

Extended Argument
Exercise v. Diet pill
Since the beginning of man we have had to do activity throughout our time, from hunting to building houses, from hiking to sports man has had movement. Then things like technology and ""easy way outs"" have come into society. Americans may have freedom to do whatever they please, but a lot of them have become lazy. What happened to the days where there was home cooked meals and kids would play outside until they could not see their hands in front of their faces? According to www.cdc.gov 66% of Americans are overweight and of those children aged from twelve to nineteen 17% are obese and children aged six to eleven 19% of them are obese. Why are a lot of Americans becoming so lazy? There is a secret that some may have never heard of, it is exercising and dieting. There are many benefits to gain from exercising. There is the safe and healthy way, then there is the ""easy way out,"" diet pills. There are ways to keep your body at its finest, there is dieting where you eat healthy and help your body, exercising is not just there to keep you strong and fit it is there to benefit you in the future, and there are
Smith 2
the diet pills which are not very beneficial.
When you diet, you can either make it hard or you can make positive change.
According to Dr. James O. Hill getting started you need to find out what your BMI is. A
BMI is your Body Mass Index and it measures the fat in your body. Next, it helps to keep a notebook of all the things you eat. You might know what you are eating but not realizing how much you are eating of it a day. The last thing when getting started is you need to make a long term commitment. (www. Web MD.com) In the book You On A Diet it explains that the first two weeks are probably the most hardest and afterwards it is a small climb everyday with dieting. It discusses ways to just cut down everything instead of dropping it all at once. Eating more green vegetables and less bread can help drop the weight within the first few weeks. Some of these things is what catches people off guard.
When dieting you must know about the food you are eating and the basic food groups. In learning more about the food groups www.cdc.gov lets us know about each group. You have your grains, fruits, vegetables, fat-free or low-fat milk products, lean meats, poultry, and fish, and nuts, seeds, and legumes. The grains include things like wheat bread, pasta and unsalted pretzels and popcorn. According to
Smith 3
fitnessforweightloss.com says you need about five to ten servings of grains a day
depending on your calorie intake. When it comes to fruits and vegetables you want to go
for bright colors and darker greens. You need three to five servings of fruits and three to five servings of vegetables. Milk products you need about three to four servings a day.
Meats, poultry and fish you need five to seven servings a day. You need three to four servings of nuts, seeds, and legumes. There is no need to stick to this all the time. Every
once in awhile you can take a break and have something like ice cream or a cookie. According to www.netdoctor.co.uk the most effective way to lose weight is by reducing your calorie intake and adding more activity to your day. When you decrease your calories gradually you start to see changes. Some changes are replace fizzy drinks and fruit cordials with water, have smaller portions of your favorite food, avoid having seconds of dinner, and cut down on beer and alcohol. Try to avoid skipping meals because it will make you hungrier later. Also every once in awhile you have cravings and you need to answer them. If you ignore them they get bigger with time and you might just start eating badly. But there also needs to be limits on cravings. If you answer every one then what was the point of dieting? You just end up going back to negatively eating stuff
Smith 4
that is bad for you.
Dieting is not the only way to lose weight. If you want to lose weight and keep it
off there is exercising. Exercising is an important part of keeping your body healthy. According to www.netdoctor.co.uk every single time you exercise more than usual, you
burn calories and fat. Exercising does not have to be boring, doing something that interests you like swimming or riding a bike is activity you can do daily. Even adding that
extra something will help. For example when you are watching television, on the
commercials get up and do jumping jacks or take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator. Simple changes like that increase activity. (www.netdoctor.co.uk)
One recommendation when losing weight is getting a pedometer. This keeps track of how many steps are taken a day. Walking daily and keeping track helps you realize what kind of activity you are doing. When you are trying to lose weight you also might want to set a realistic goal. If you set a goal that is so far off then it will be difficult for you to reach. When you are setting goals you also might want to stay positive. Talk yourself up instead of down, it will help in the long run. It keeps you positive throughout your weight losing experience. Another thing is get the recommended time of sleep, when
Smith 5
your rested you have more energy to do things. (weightloss.about.com)
There are also benefits in your daily life when you exercise. According to www.mayoclinic.com exercise can improve your mood. It helps calm you down after a
stressful day and it releases endorphins which make you happier. Exercise can even reduce feelings of depression and anxiety. Also regular exercise can help prevent or
manage high blood pressure, type two diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain types of cancer. (mayoclinic.com) Exercising helps to manage your weight and strengthen your heart and lungs. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and as the blood pumps
through your heart and blood vessels it helps it work more efficiently (mayoclinic.com). When it works more efficiently you gain more energy to do more things. Exercising can also be fun, all it takes is finding something you enjoy. Include other people as well, if you have someone to work out with it does not have to be ""boring"" as some would say.
There are also other ways to exercise besides just cardio or physical activity, there is also lifting weights. The site exercise.about.com explains reason to lift weights and its benefits. One is lifting weights builds lean muscle tissue which is more metabolically active than fat. Regularly strength training is just as important as exercising. It also makes
Smith 6
you stronger, not just stronger for exercising but in everyday life. It makes things a little easier like, carrying groceries, housework, carrying children, gardening, etc. Also it does not just make your muscles stronger, it makes your bones stronger. (www.exercise.about.com) Lifting also helps reduce risk of injury and can reduce arthritis
pain. Lifting weights gives your joints some cushion therefore reducing joint pain. It increases your balance, stability, and flexibility, and it makes you feel better about yourself. People start to notice changes about themselves and start to feel more confident.
Weight lifting also adds a challenge to your daily routine. Instead of just doing typical cardio you give your body a different workout. (www.exercise.about.com) You feel the improvements throughout your daily life as things get better and easier.
Exercising and lifting weights are healthy but there are also bad techniques when
it comes to exercise. According to www.aolhealth.com lifting too much weight can injure muscles and create incorrect alignment of the spine. When lifting certain weights people use momentum instead of properly aligning their spine and strong core muscles. (aolhealth.com) Then there are the guys and maybe even girls that work on only their biceps. The thing is you can not just do that because not only is the bicep the smallest
Smith 7
muscle in your upper body, you need to work on other places to make it more effective. (aolhealth.com) Working on just your abs also will not work. You need to do cardio to lose the fat if you want to strengthen the muscle. If you need to hold yourself up to keep balance on a cardio machine than it will not be effective. It can be dangerous and not worth it, it is just better to go a slower speed than anything. Lastly if you just stick to the
same routine over and over eventually your body gets used to it. You will start to see no changes and wondering what you are doing wrong. You need to surprise your body with different routines to drop the weight and get lean. (www.aolhealth.com)
Not only are there bad techniques to exercising there is also the ""easy way out,""
diet pills. Health.howstuffworks.com explains that diet pill ads help you ""feel more fit,"" ""boost your energy"" and ""melt away the pounds."" Now diet pills are a multibillion dollar industry in the United States. (health.howstuffworks.com) There are different forms of
Smith 8
diet drugs, there is prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements, patches, powder, or in liquid forms. You see many different ads on the television and on the internet and a
majority of them are products that are unregulated, untested, and unproven. Even if the diet pill was effective it would only work for six months because eventually your body becomes immune to it. Once that happens you still need to diet and exercise in order to still lose weight, if not you gain all the weight right back. (health.howstuffworks.com)
Some side effects of diet pills vary with ingredients. For instance the diet pill Xenical has fat blockers like orlistat. This removes excess fats in the intestines which causes uncomfortable cramping, gas, and diarrhea. It also takes the bodies absorption of vitamins and nutrients and whoever takes Xenical also needs to take a multivitamin.
Another dangerous ingredient is sibutramine in Meridia. This ingredient is an appetite suppressant that triggers your sympathetic nervous system, this raises your blood pressure and heart rate. This increases risk of heart attacks and cardiac arrests. In February 1998 and March 2003, the FDA received reports of forty nine deaths related to sibutramine. Other side effects include constipation, headache, dry mouth and insomnia. (health.howstuffworks.com) These are the things that people do not look at or think about when getting diet pills. The pills eventually stop working and you eventually gain the
Smith 9
weight back. So are diet pills really worth it?
So what is more safe dieting and exercise or diet pills? Sure diet pills work a little faster but they damage you internally. Dieting and exercise may take a little longer but it makes it that much better when you work hard for it. Exercising helps you in the long run and makes sure that your body is at your best. Diet pills might help but in order for them to really work you still need to diet and exercise. Also it would take time for the pills to come into effect. Why is it that Americans do not want to take the time to exercise? Just
small changes a day will make it easier throughout your weight losing period. There are ways to keep your body at its finest, there is dieting where you eat healthy and help your body, exercising is not just there to keep you strong and fit it is there to benefit you in the future, and there are the diet pills which are not very beneficial.

"Why People Have Extreme Desire to Pursue Perfect Body Image 
Have you ever thought about the deep motivations and purposes under your every behavior? You know you skip meals because you want to be slimmer. But do you know why you want to be slim? But keep asking why, we may end up like ""It is human's nature to pursue being beautiful."" People naturally like beautiful clothes, decorations and perhaps beautiful persons. Under this circumstance, we should not blame these people for going on a diet. It makes sense. But it is only part of the truth. When skipping meals becomes eating disorders, positive desire becomes endless stress, we cannot explain it just with ""human nature"". It will be unusual to control weight at such an abnormal level. In China, there is an old saying: things turn into their opposites when they reach the extreme. I am forcing on these extreme behaviors rather than healthy ways like working out to keep slim. Again, asking same questions, I think another answer will be that they hope to own an easy life by having good appearance. They long for acceptance from others. In other words, those people don't have strong self-identification. 
As people have such a human nature, when they see attractive people in daily life, who are also popular, being the center of the groups, they will probably compare themselves with them and feel a little bit sad: They are so amazing. My legs are not that long and my eyes are small. For most people, this emotion will not last long. They are sure they have good personalities. It is fine not being attractive physically. And then they continue their normal life. However, when you observe people with serious body dissatisfaction, you will find it lasts for months and years. Their experience like being mocked is so indelible that it influences their judgment greatly. It means they cannot tell correctly which are the results of having imperfect body. They tend to blame all their misfortune for imperfect shape by comparison with the advantages attractive people have. For example, they think they are not welcomed by others because of the appearance. Generally, this attitude leads to anther situation: I do not have courage to pursue something since I am not good-looking. This situation causes long-time inferiority. We all know people with inferiority long for other people's recognition. So do those with extreme body dissatisfaction. They need acceptance. In their opinion, only being perfect can earn it. 
It is reasonable for people trying to get acceptance from others. Unfortunately, this desire for people with extreme body dissatisfaction are under an abnormal level again. Why they concern about others' opinions so much? Are they vain? I do not think so. We know a confident person think in a way like I can do it by my effort. But it is not true for low self-esteem people. They doubt their abilities. The reason is the same. They cannot tell the correct relationship between their misfortune and their appearance. But they have to deal with various difficulties. Where can they get confidence? The only way is from others. They believe in others more than themselves. Otherwise, how can they spare no efforts to win acceptance? If someone laughs at me and says you are ugly, I will feel angry and answer: It is none of your business. But for people with inferiority, they will agree with this judgment and feel sad. What they are lack of? That is self-identification. It means those people cannot find their own progress and feel satisfied. They can only receive satisfaction by other peoples' words. Similarly, if someone laughs at he, he will not try to argue with it, but just accept. It in turn gains his inferiority. 
In conclusion, seeking acceptance from others is the main motivation for people to do some unhealthy behavior. But we should notice it is the lack of self-identification that leads the desire to become crazy.

"Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence 
Professor Stephen Hawkings, a distinguished British physicist from Cambridge University, said that the development of Artificial Intelligence would spell the end of the human race (Jones, 2014). According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence. According to Jones (2014), Professor Hawkings said that AI would eventually surpass human's intelligence and would decide that humans are no longer necessary and end mankind. I would provide evidence as to why I believe AI is more disadvantageous as compared to the advantages using an expert's opinion, several academic journals and online articles. 
The main disadvantage is that there would be a loss of job opportunities. Computers with AI would be able to complete the task faster and more efficiently with less errors. Hence, it makes more sense for companies to use computers instead of human labor. However, Mr <Name>, a graduate student who is currently studying Robotics at <Name> University objects here that the loss of jobs would challenge humans to take up more creative jobs that robots would not be able to do. Although that might still be applicable now, I believe that a time would come when robots would be able to do every single task humans can do perfectly. When that time comes, there would be no jobs left for humans. This would be bad for us because taking away our jobs means taking away our identity and also our ability to make a living. 
Although robots will release us from physically exhausting or dangerous work, the development of AI could lead to people having a wrong mentality, over-relying on AI. Technology has made people lazy. In a subway, if there is an escalator and a flight of stairs right next to each other, most people would choose to take the escalator because it makes their life easier and they would also reach their destination faster. People who do not do physical activity as much due to taking the escalator would be physically weaker than those who take the stairs. There is a strong correlation between taking the escalator and obesity. According to Wrenn (2012), researchers at the University of Gothenburg discovered that people who constantly use a computer are more susceptible to stress, sleeping disorders and depression. This strengthens my argument that the development of technology such as AI would lead to problems such as obesity, depression and other mental illnesses. 
Besides that, AI does not have to be fully-developed to be dangerous to humans. There is much speculation from the general population and the mass media that robots with AI would eventually take over the world and end the human race. However, if we put that aside and think rationally, AI does not need to be truly ""intelligent"" to be harmful. Marcus (2014) argues that computers do not require AI to be dangerous. If there was a bug in a driverless car, the car would crash, endangering the passenger inside the car. Apart from that, the usage of AI in war is also growing by using unmanned vehicles to control soldier fatality rate. According to Weeks (2011), United States' use of drones has resulted in hostility, especially in Pakistan, where numerous innocent civilians and few criminals have been killed in attacks by drones. Also, there is a huge risk that AI military would fall into the wrong hands. This could even lead a third world war. It is difficult to control the usage of AI, but it is evident that developing AI is detrimental to humans. 
A downside of AI is that it lacks human emotion which would lead to bad decision making. It does not feel guilt or shame and the AI agent would not be proficient in managing relationships. Although human emotions get in the way of certain decisions where we are required to think more logically and rationally, but there are still a lot of decisions out there that requires human emotion and compassion. In the interview, <Name> said that he did not think robots with AI would ever have souls. Hence, they do not have the thing that makes people good or evil or makes people feel emotions. AI does not have empathy, it would not be able to put itself in other people's shoes. Although a super intelligent virtual psychologist with abilities such as being able to detect body temperature changes and analyze body language is currently being developed, it would not be able to have human emotions (Luxton, 2014). Hence, the virtual psychologist would not be able to sympathize with the patient, which is an incredibly important trait for doctors in the field of psychology. Another example is if a young cyclist is about to crash into a driverless car with AI, the AI system would just calculate who has the highest chance of survival from the car crash, the passenger sitting in the car or the cyclist and if it is the former, it would allow the crash to occur. The AI system would not think of how the young cyclist still has a long life ahead of him. An AI system should not be directly involved in making decisions where compassion is required as this would lead to bad consequences. 
In summary, the evidence I have listed in each paragraph discusses that the disadvantages of AI supersedes the benefits. However, AI is still in its early stages and it is too soon to make a conclusion of whether our lives would be impacted positively or negatively by AI. We would have to be very cautious in how we handle AI. For example, the government should consider having bioethics classes in universities to further discuss how we should handle the disadvantages or ethical issues that arise from developing AI.

"Thesis: 
To avoid even more Fiscal, government shouldn't take the job, since this project is no way to make any money to support itself and then it turns into a nowhere. The future of electric cars is promising and greatly beneficial for public but the technology need to go on developing. 
There are people who have been expecting the technology of electric cars would improve people's life. They are so eager to seek the support by government, and that means to pay the taxpayers' money to electric car companies. But this wouldn't help, no matter how much the government pay, the inconvenience of electric cars is not going to change, so people wouldn't buy them and companies won't make profits. Issuing government to do this would result in corruption and waste of tax. 
What people might argue against my thesis: 
To reduce the pollution made by transportation, electric cars should seek more support from public. For example, in order to make the electric cars more convenient to use, government could issue some policies for electric car companies to build more recharge stations and invest more on basic electricity facilities. 
Most electric cars need to recharge a lot, and so far this is the biggest drawback. To solve this problem, more recharge stations need to be built. Building a recharge station is very expensive and need a relatively longer time to have profits, so electric car companies, especially which just started, are not capable to make such an investment. Now, to realize the great future of the public, government and other instruments really need to give a hand.

Confucian teaching methods should be applied to the college education at Purdue 
If you ask Chinese who was the most famous teacher in Chinese history, I think most of them will tell you: Confucius. Confucius, who was a famous teacher, politician, and philosopher of China, was born in 551 BC. At that time, war erupted frequently, and most of people engaged in getting power and wealth from the war, neglecting learning knowledge and enhancing self- cultivation. As a result, Confucius chose to become a teacher in order to teach and encourage more people to learn knowledge. He discovered and applied many his own teaching methods to teach his students and as a result, helped his students make a great progress. Some of his famous students like Zilu and Yanhui all become high officials in the end. His teaching methods are recorded in the book Lun Yu by his students after he dead. However, here comes a question, can we still take advantage of Confucian teaching methods nowadays to enhance our teaching efficiency and quality at Purdue? In my opinion, we can still apply these three Confucian teaching methods in university education at Purdue: ""Yin cai shi jiao"", ""You jiao wu lei"" and ""Wen gu zhi xin"". In this research paper, I will first give a brief introduction of these three most famous Confucian teaching methods, then analyze how Confucius applied these three teaching methods historically and finally I will give supporting evidence to my opinion. 
First of all, let's look at the definition of these three Confucian teaching methods and how Confucius applied these teaching methods historically. From Xinyu He, a professor in Xichang university, whose article was published in Xichang university newspaper, ""Yin cai shi jiao"" means using different teaching methods to teach different students according to their characteristics and family and education backgrounds. (1) According to Lunyu, in the history, Confucius divided his students into different groups according to their education backgrounds and attitudes of study etc. For example, some students understand that study was beneficial to him and as result be positive to study. However, some students thought that the success in the war is far more important than learning knowledge and was not willing to use time in learning. Regarding different groups, Confucius would use different teaching methods to teach. For example, when teaching those students who were not willing to learn, Confucius would try to let them understand the importance of learning the same time he taught them knowledge. This is different when Confucius taught those students who was positive to study. 
Second, according to Huiying Wang, a history professor in Hei He college, whose article was published in Heihe college newspaper, ""Wen gu zhi xin"" means that we can enhance our understanding of the knowledge we have already learned by reviewing them (2). Historically, Confucius always asked his students to review what they learned to enhance their understanding of knowledge points. According to Lunyu, once a time, Confucius taught his students how an emperor set a law to govern the country. The first day, students only understood that the law were set based on the political needs. However, on the next day, when students reviewed this knowledge and re-thought about it, they understood that the law was always set based on the economy need. By reviewing the knowledge again and again, Confucian students learned more in depth than before. 
Third, from Mingfeng Bai's, who was an educator in China, whose article was published in Education explore, """"You jiao wu lei"" means teachers should treat their students equally regardless their backgrounds and personalities"" (1). As Bai said in his article, Confucian students have different family backgrounds. Some of their families are rich or own great powers and some of them are too poor to pay the tuition. However, once Confucius decided to teach a student, he would use same attitudes and efforts to treat them no matter what's their backgrounds are. 
After having a brief recognition and knowledge of these three teaching methods, next I will illustrate why I think that we can still apply these three teaching methods to the university education at Purdue. 
First of all, the reason I suggest to apply ""Yin cai shi jiao"" to the university education at Purdue is because ""Yin cai shi jiao"" can help students improve the learning efficiency. For example, students at Purdue are coming from more than 100 countries currently. Based on the website realclear.com, students from eastern countries like China, Korea are usually introverted and not good at expressing their ideas in class, since in their high school, the classes were lecture-based. However, local students or students from western countries are active and extroverted since in the high school, their teachers encouraged them to interact. Thus, when Purdue's teachers meet students from eastern countries, they should encourage them to express their ideas and to speak to teachers whenever problems they met in study. As a result, teachers can help them solve the problems and enhance their learning efficiency. Based on this example and how did Confucius applied this teaching method, I think teachers should analyze each student's characteristics and background at first and set up different study plans according to the differences. As a result, each student can learn knowledge in a method that is most proper to him and finally the learning efficiency will be improved. 
Second, I suggest to apply ""Wen gu zhi xin"" to the university education because this teaching method can help students overcome the limit of intelligence. According to philosopher, Micah's article, human intelligence is limited, and students need reviewing to give their brain more time and opportunities to think and understand knowledge points in depth (1). Based on Micah's article, I think Wang gave a good solution to overcome the limit of human intelligence. ""Just like teaching a formula in calculus, the first time when students learned it, they may only knew how to apply it. However, when they reviewed it again, they may understand why this formula is right and what the relation between this formula and other formulas."" (2). Based on the example Wang gave in her article, I think ""Wen gu zhi xin"" is a good method to help students enhance understanding of knowledge and overcome the limit of human intelligence. Thus, we should apply this teaching method to the university education at Purdue. 
Third, I also suggest to apply ""You jiao wu lei"" to the university education at Purdue. As far as I am concerned, treating students equally regardless their family background is a teacher's responsibility. For example, I met a teacher before, who show inpatient to answer my question because my English was not so good. However, as a teacher, you should be responsible and use your full effort to treat all of your students equally. I think each student is a part of a teacher's job, thus, if a teacher want to be responsible to their job, he should be responsible to all of his students. I did an interview with a history professor <Name> in Beijing Normal University. Zhou argued that responsibility is an essential factor to measure a teacher. If a teacher is not responsible, the teaching quality is not guaranteed. Thus, she mentioned, students in her university will be asked whether they feel be treated differently by a teacher at the end of each semester by using a questionnaire. Her university conducted this research in each semester to guarantee teachers treat students equally and be responsible to all students. (<Name>. Personal Interview, 26, March, 2016). 
Up till now, I have analyzed why I think that we can apply these three teaching methods to the university education. 
However, I also acknowledge an opposite opinion about applying ""Wen gu zhi xin"" to the university education. From the internet, some people argued that the updating of knowledge is very fast nowadays. Thus, we should focus more on learning new knowledge instead of using time reviewing old knowledge. However, I also held the opinion that the updated knowledge is based on current knowledge. Thus, in order to learn new knowledge well, we need to have a good understanding of current knowledge and use them lay a foundation for our further learning. Since reviewing can help us enhance the understanding of old knowledge and contribute to the learning of knowledge, thus, we still need to apply 'Wen gu zhi xin"" to university education nowadays. 
All in all, based on above analysis, I think we can still apply these three Confucian teaching methods to the university education at Purdue, since all of these three methods are still have their values nowadays. Thus, for certain classes, like calculus, which contain 200 students per class currently, Purdue can reduce it size to let teachers set different teaching plans according to different students groups. Meanwhile, I think Purdue should also give teachers some explanation to let them understand why these three teaching methods are valuable and then they can apply these three methods to Purdue.

"The future of retailing market will not only survive but thrive 
With the dramatic rise of online shopping, the business environment is getting tougher for retailing market to keep making profit. As a result, many people including experts predict that the future of retailing market is hopeless. Most reasons can be summarized by a report from an investment company called AMPCAPITAL (2013). The company stated that retailers are facing a deteriorating external environment, existing high fixed costs like rental expenses can account for anywhere up to 45% of a retailers' operating costs based. The increase in capital expenditure leads to a sharp decrease in margin. Compare with the depressed retailing market, the performance of online shopping is way above expectation. Take a look at the latest news just updated by TECHINASIA (2015). Alibaba reached a sale of $14. 3 billion in 2015 double eleven shopping. And mobile sales accounted for nearly 70% of that revenue, which means Alibaba sold $9. 8 billion worth of goods via mobile devices. If most of the people shopping with mobile devices how could retailing market possibly maintaining its business? It seems that the retailing market is really on the verge of a tipping point. However will retailing market fade out in the future? Probably not. 
To figuring out why retailing market can survive in the future, first we need to know about how traditional stores perform nowadays. Patrick Dixon (2013) of Kings College in London pointed out that nowadays retailing is confusing for traditional shops. He concluded that people nowadays shopping in a mixed pattern with higher mobility: shopping in-store for delivery at home, or shopping online for collection in-store, or for collection at a petrol station, or another branch of the same store and so on. It's clear that nowadays people shop in a more complex and flexible way which pay strong focuses on higher mobility and efficiency. Traditional retailing market is gradually getting the key points of the customers nowadays and thus can survive for a long period of time. But as to thrive, others may say that how a physical store can beat out online shopping since everybody goes mobile. 
Most of the people have the stereotype about going online or mobile cause damage to physical retailers, but actually retailers can build a more efficient connection with customer by using digital resources. Google (2014) conducted a research with Ipsos Media CT and Sterling Brands suggested that the relationship between digital and in-store shopping is far more nuanced and interconnected than what we thought online shopping making local retail store obsolete. The research actually provided us some interesting information between online shopping and retail store. First of all, most of us would think that search results online will only send consumers to e-commerce sites. But the truth is that these search results are also a powerful way to drive people to stores. As a result online information can propel people to shop in-store. Second myth is that customers in the store often looking at their smartphone so the retailer loses their attention. The reality can be reversed if retailers can grab customer's attention through search results and their mobile site or app which turns smartphone into the best sales associate. Third rumor is that online research has lowered consumer's expectations of stores; they really just go to a store to transact. The fact is that consumers visit stores for more than just a purchase, and their expectations of retailers are higher than before. They're looking for an informative, customized experience. So Google give a short conclusion is that a store should tailored to the savvy shopper. By busted all those myths, it seems that going online can also turn into a weapon to fight against online shopping. 
Getting to understand the change can be done by going online can be a starting point to thrive. But in order to evolve to be invincible, retailing market still needs a unique skill to evolve. A unique skill that online shopping is lack of from the day it is created. So a whole new concept of retail which hybrids the advantages of both online and offline actually exist. It's called omni-channel retail. Article written by Candice Landau the Managing Editor of Bplans states that omni-channel is the logical evolution of multi-channel retailing simply means that you will use multiple channels (computers, brick-and-mortar stores, direct mail, catalogs, mobile devices, etc) to create a seamless consumer experience. Three tips mentioned by Candice Landau is really helpful. First from psychological side is to optimize locations based on new shopping behaviors. Second from physical side is to integrate all of your operations across channels to create a channel-less operating model. Simply describes as integrated the online shopping experience within a retail stores like using a discount they receive online or pickup online orders. Last of all, innovation. If you are a store owner come up with your own strategies to keep people buying. You will likely need to encourage a mix of mobile, web and in-store actions. Now by glimpsing the future of retail market, omni-channel is at retailing's core. 
Although online shopping does make impact on retailing markets and the trend of online shopping is irreversible, retailing market shouldn't sitting there waiting for death. The future of retail market is still optimistic even robust as soon as it integrate with the interdisciplinary experiences of consumer's behavior. Evolving to omni-channel is essential to win back the market share that previously taken by online shopping and improve profit margin. In conclusion, the retailing market is for customers and by customers. A change in mastering the power of going mobile combine with the talent of physical retail will make a huge difference in getting confidence back.

"Speaking of the motivations of studying abroad, researchers and socialists have conducted numbers of research and studies analyzing and synthesizing this topic. The results that drew from the studies are quite similar; however the motivations could be self-determined or involuntary. Which category of motivation plays the most important role in students' lives of studying abroad has been fiercely debated among researchers and scholars. Shown by the article, ""Motivations and Decision-making Processes of Mainland Chinese Students for Undertaking Master's Program Abroad"" , published on Journal of Studies in International Education, personal factors are the most prevailing responses provided by students. Furthermore, another research paper published on International Journal of Intercultural Relations suggests that self-determined motivations to study abroad are also beneficial for students' adaptation outcomes. In summary, the impact of self-determined motivation on students' experiences of studying abroad is more significant than that of involuntary motivation. 
Self-determined motivation has significant effect on decision-making process. Self-determined motivation, defined as factors that enabling students to make decisions to satisfy their personal needs and interests, includes students' interests to immerse into a foreign culture, and desire of self-improvement. For students who are interested in exploring new cultures, improving themselves, and advancing themselves after high school or universities, studying abroad satisfies their needs properly. The best way to fully-understand a culture is to go to that country, living with local people and immersing in the culture. Furthermore, it is also a good way to learn a foreign language. Besides, living and studying in a foreign country independently are not easy for an individual. By overcoming communication barrier, homesickness and loneness, students will grow stronger both mentally and physically. Also, for students who cannot receive good education in their home countries, studying in countries with world-class universities abound, like the united states and the united kingdom, will provide considerable rewards for students who are pursuing advances in some specific fields. According to Motivations and Decision-making Processes of Mainland Chinese Students for Undertaking Master's Program Abroad, published on Journal of Studies in International Education, the research conducted to discover the motivation of students studying abroad shows that the result that most students chose to study overseas because of cultural enrichment, personal growth and personal improvement. In other word, students' own willingness to study abroad is the leading factor to their final decision. 
Involuntary motivation, however, also has some effect on students, but are somehow temporary and negative. 
Sometimes, like those self-determined motivations, involuntary motivations could also be the main elements that propel decision. Involuntary motivation usually includes factors come from family and society. For instance, China is now undergoing economic reform. The situation in China is not too optimistic. The lack of employment, bad living condition and unfair treatment in the society are all obvious factors that stimulate decisions of studying abroad. Apart from that, some students attend foreign universities because of the wishes of their parents. In those cases, the involuntary factor plays a role during the process of making decision. Since they unwillingly made their decision of studying abroad, those external factors came from families and society could negatively affect their lives in a foreign countries. ""The role of self-determined motivation and goals for study abroad in the adaptation of international students"", an article analyzing the role of motivation in students' adaptation of foreign culture states that the non-self-determined, involuntary, decision negatively influences the adaptation of students into a new environment. Students motivated by involuntary factors are more likely to conserve their original stats, which means maintain their lifestyles and avoid challenges in their lives. On the other hand, self-determined motivation including the desire of self-developing promotes one's aspiration to enhance himself and thereby encouraging him to get involved in the new environment and fulfill his dream. The experience of my cousin and my friend is the best example of this theory. My friend, who is 2 years older than me, by her parents' wish, have studied in the United Kingdom for two years. She thinks her life in UK is tedious. She forces herself to attend classes and listens to the teachers in class. Although she gets fair grade without striving for it, she dose not gain joy. On the contrary, my cousin has a great time in the United States. He is a graduate student, who furthers his academic journey in Johns Hopkins University. After he graduated from Beijing Normal University, he chose to apply for an American University for his graduate education. As an undergraduate in Beijing Normal University, he majored in environmental science, which is Johns Hopkins University famous for. Without hesitance, he applied for Johns Hopkins University and he got accepted. Two years in Johns Hopkins, he not only achieved great success in academic field, but also made a lots of new friends. Sometimes he posts interesting photo on internet, I can tell that he is happy studying and living in the United States. 
Personal need is usually the beginning of an story. To satisfy our needs, we take actions. In this case, curiosity of foreign culture, pursuit of high quality education, desire of self-enhancement are personal needs that lead to a decision of studying abroad. After we arrive, the desires continue to influence our behaviors, reminding us of our original intention and encouraging us to rapidly involve in the community. Therefore, self-determined motivation is not only the decisive element while students are making their decisions to study abroad, but also an assurance of striving after they actually start new lives in a foreign country; apparently, it is remarkably influential.

"Draft#1 Argumentative Essay 
04/10/2016 
Online Shopping 
Can you spend a day without browsing Facebook or Instagram? Can you choose to not surfing on the Internet when you are free? Can you imagine your life without Internet? I believe most people's answer will be ""NO."" With the development of modern society, internet is becoming more and more popular among people in different ages and almost turn into one of people's necessities for life. People can do a lot of things on internet, like reading online books and watching online movies. However, today I am going to talk about the other thing people can do by using internet-online shopping. Online shopping is an act of purchasing products or services directly from sellers over the Internet by using web browser. It has gradually come into a fashion in many cities. Then raised a concern that whether online shopping can benefit people or not. As far as I am concerned, online shopping is important because it is very convenient and people can buy the stuff they want by just browsing the company's website without walking around. 
First and foremost, the biggest advantage of online shopping is probably its convenience. Different from shopping in stores, there are no lines for people to wait in or shopping assistants to bother you, and people can do and finish their shopping in just a few minutes with only two steps: choosing the products and placing the order. Moreover, online shopping is really a good choice for people who are very busy because they are not restricted by the time and the place anymore. People can buy products at any time they wanted, for example the break between their works and the time they having lunch, because as long as people have internet connection they are able to access the shopping website. According to the article ""Consumers' attitude towards online shopping: Factors influencing employees of crazy domains to shop online"" by Saad Akbar and Paul TJ James, convenience is the first reason employee, groups who are always very busy, to do online shopping. 
Secondly, a convincing advantage of online shopping is that people are able to have a better price. The first reason for that is people can easily browse through dozens of different website for the same kind of product. This can help them find to best price. Although people can also do the same at a mall, it would take a lot of time and maybe also a long walk. The second reason that cheap deals and better prices are available online is products come to people are directly from the manufacturer or seller without middle people who are always adding prices in order to get more profits being involved. Also, many online shoppers often offer discount for customers. Take my own experience as an example, I went to the Tmall last Sunday and was attracted by a pair of sneaker, which was priced by 90 dollars. I really liked it, but I thought it was a little bit expensive. My friend then suggested me to find it on the Internet because she said that there is always cheaper price to shop online. As we expected, it was only priced by 84 dollars on the website and cost me 80 dollars finally after a discount. 
However, some people hold different opinions about online shopping. Based on what <name>, a graduated student who I interviewed before, said. For consumers, the biggest problem is probably that there are always some differences between the real product and the product in picture on the website. In the past, most online shopping website did not have the service of free returning for customers. On the other hand, nowadays, online shopping system has improved a lots by including not only some other people's shopping experiences with the products they bought, but also their comments on the products. As a result, it is easier for people to know the ""reality"" and help them to make decision whether the product worth that price. Moreover, most online shopping system today have the policy of free changing and returning in nearby store, which can be very convenient for people. 
As a conclusion, in this fast developed society, there is a tendency for people using advanced technology to improve their life quality. And in order to get more convenience and benefits, people need to figure out how exactly this technology can contribute to society. I am glad that I am able to get know about this after reading some articles and interview the experts.

"How international students successfully overcome and benefit from eating lives? 
Purdue University 
04/08/2015 
Abstract 
Eating lives act as problems in more and more international students' studying lives in the U.S. At Purdue, from my personal experience and communication with others, eating lives do negatively affect many international students a lot. The reason which cause the problem can mainly due to two parts: the big difference between culture eating habits and schedule, side-effects of not adapting to the new environment. After my deep research and interview at Purdue, I have found out several ways to relatively solve the problem. Keeping a relative balance and trying to fit the environment will be a beneficial experience to every international student. This is a way they can choose to deal with their eating lives. 
Key words: International students, eating life, new environment. 
How international students successfully overcome and benefit from eating lives? 
Introduction 
Recent years, the number of international students study in American college significantly increase, in 2014, there are about 900,000 foreign students enroll in U.S higher education system, which gets a 40% increase comparing with 2004.(UWN, 2014) Accompanying with the increasing of international students, many problem rising quickly. The daily eating life of these international students is just a typical one. Because of the big difference between home-countries and the U.S in culture and eating habits, finding uncomfortable experiences in eating is very common among international students. The reasons which causing the uncomfortable experiences are very complex, they may include different schedule, different types of foods, different environments of eating and many other factors. Therefore, it is really important for me to find out a way which can make international students deal with their eating life without difficulties. After interviewing two international students with different ages that from two different countries in Purdue, I found the main cause for foreign students at Purdue to having problems in eating lives. Besides, some methods for international students to truly conquer this problem are also concluded by me. Trying best to fit into the schedule of American eating habits and keeping a relative balance between American food and home-countries' food should be the best way for solving this problem. Studying in American is a comprehensive experience, it should include many aspects. Different eating experience is just one of them. Therefore, trying to change it from ourselves should be the best way. 
Causation 
When suddenly move to such a new environment, the transaction for a freshman student is very hard. Sometimes the most difficult part for an international student in the first college year is not the studying part, but the living part. Eating life is just a big factor in this transaction. According to an academic paper Impact of the American Diet on Newly-Arrived International Students during their first three months at Virginia Tech, (Almohanna 2010 Dec 4), there will be a big change on bodies of international students after a certain period of taking American food which is a totally new types of food. Although this kind of change is not always appear negative on every person, it does affect their lives in a huge extent. In Almohanna's paper, he claimed that these ""new"" American food mainly influence international students in energy and weight. In a scientific way, the sudden engage of American food which has high level calorie may cause international students gain some weight in a short period. And the side-effect of increasing-weight is the lost of energy for studying and working. This may cause many further negative effect in the future. If we view this problem in another way, we can conclude another reason causing eating problem. Because of the difficulties for accepting American food and meanwhile can't find other replacing food in a short time, some international students will cut their diet in short-run. The result of this is very obvious - lacking of energy, further and deeper uncomfortable with eating life. 
Solution 
Under such a situation, it is very hard for international to study in a good condition. ""The first month I came here was not so bad, but in the second month, I really got tired of American food. I was really surprised about that I got tired of it such quick. As a result, during the second and third month, I only ate about 2 meals every day.""(<name> 2015) This was what one of my interviewee said. The efficient and concentration for study will be really low when someone even can't make his stomach full. 
In an academic paper Changes in dietary habits following temporal migration. The case of international students in Belgium. (Perez-Cueto, Verbeke, Lachat 2008 Jan 29), they pointed out that the changing of dietary habits of international students should be an initiative action. International students should trying to fit into the environment but not waiting the surrounding elements to fit them. Actually there are many easy methods for overcoming this problem. From one of my interviewee <name>, what he did was ""keeping a superficial balance between American food and Chinese food.""(Chang 2015) In his point of view, making a true balance between American food and Chinese food is almost impossible for international students. But what they can choose is ""having breakfast or lunch with American food which are easier to access and quicker to eat and cooking some Chinese food for dinner which are more delicious for us.""(<name> 2015) Making the largest use of two different advantages of two types of food can be really an enjoyable solution for eating problem of international students. Actually I think this can be seen as a really good example of fitting into a strange environment: mixing different elements and creating an own way of living or eating. 
Conclusion 
Eating lives are very important to students' lives. It should be a process which is enjoyable and helpful to a student, but not a thing which concerned by international student who has already concerned about many other problems coming with the sudden shift to a new environment. In order to fit and adapt to a new types of food as quick as they can, international students can choose to try to keep a superficial balance between different kinds of food and find an own way to dealing eating life. Making the biggest use of advantages of different foods are really helpful to them. Trying to fit into the situation with the best they can is a process which present their transaction from their own culture to a new culture. Actually, this is just one part of the college study.

The Bitcoin is a Viable Option for Currency in the Future 
Introduction 
	The new form of ""digital currency' (Nian & Chuen, 2015), the Bitcoin, has been a hot topic of discussion for the past few years, due to its tempting advantages, and disadvantages. Many argue that the bitcoin has a bright future, while others, like the famous economist Paul Krugman (2013), say that the bitcoin is ""evil"". The main concern with the bitcoin is to do with its safety and privacy. The privacy aspect perplexes the public whether it is a positive characteristic or not, while the fact that the bitcoin is entirely digital, plants doubt in the minds of the people regarding safety. In this paper, I argue that the bitcoin is bound to be successful in the future, and would be an additional option for currency in the world today. 
Background Information 
	The bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2003, and has been implemented and used since 2008. It is a technology that exists only on the internet, and a network that makes currency transactions and transfers considerably faster. Since it is entirely based on the internet, it has been subjected to ""attacks"", which are unconventional manners in which a bitcoin is used for selfish purposes. The two most common attacks are ""double spending"" and ""mixing"" (<Name>, personal communication, February 26, 2016). Double spending is where the attacker tries to pay with the same bitcoin to different recipients, while he only pays once. Fortunately, this attack can be prevented by people known as miners, who ""check and verify transactions to proceed"" (<Name>, personal communication, February 26, 2016). Mixing is when the various senders and receivers of the bitcoin transactions cannot be traced back to the individual, which is why bitcoins are not regulated by banks or by the government, and is instead regulated by the miners who record these transactions in an online ledger known as the ""blockchain"" (""Hidden Flipside; Bitcoin's Future"", 2014). So when person A sends some bitcoins to person B, the miners code on their computers to verify the transaction which is then recorded on the blockchain, Person B then receives the sent money in his ""bitcoin wallet"", an application on the computer or a mobile device that stores the bitcoin currency and keeps track of all personal transactions (Bitcoin.org). 
My Argument 
	The most important advantage the bitcoin has is that it is accessible at a global scale. So as a global entity, independent of regional economic inflation and free from any third party influence (Almazrua, 2014) makes this decentralized system a great platform for money transactions. Usually banks incur a large amount of fee for transactions, especially international ones. But using bitcoins would charge a very small fee, which is used as a proof of transaction, and is the same for all kinds of transactions. As a global currency, the bitcoin also has a huge advantage of taking an average of ten minutes for every type of transaction, which speeds up the process of money transfers by a large margin, especially international transfers (Badea & Rogojanu, 2014). Having a speedy process, without a large fee taxation, is an important feature that would bring the bitcoin to a larger audience, and would serve as a successful platform of money transfers in the future. And it is only 2016 today, 7-8 years from when the bitcoin was first introduced, and it has already gained millions of users across the globe, inspiring various business companies to adopt this additional system (P. M. Sanchez, personal communication, February 26, 2016), showing that the bitcoin is already on its road to success. 
	Regardless of the bitcoin's success today, a large number of questions about the privacy policy, or the anonymity, have been raised. Since the bitcoin is a decentralized system, it raises the question of trust, which is an essential part of the bitcoin's working. The purpose of the bitcoin is to maintain the anonymity of the sender and the receiver, which is why it appeals to millions of people today. While it succeeds in masking the identity of an individual, people argue that this is an easy platform for criminal activity, such as money laundering (P. M. Sanchez, personal communication, February 26, 2016). Even though this is true, it does not change the fact that money laundering and other such criminal activities do not already exist using other currencies (Godsiff, 2015). In fact, the bitcoin cannot have more anonymity that cash, and that it also prevents financial crimes (Bitcoin.org), hence, the existence of bitcoins is not going to increase criminal activity. Also, banks require a lot of personal information of a customer, which can be stolen easily when purchasing something through a credit card, which puts the customer's identity at risk (Walker, 2015). But the use of bitcoins requires very little personal information to be shared, and is much more private, which from a user's perspective is ideal. 
	The second pressing issue is the security of using bitcoins. Since this entity is not in the physical form and exists entirely on the internet without the backing of a third party, hacking into personal digital wallets or the bitcoin network as a whole to steal all the bitcoins is a large possibility, and has been done in the past. This aspect refrains people from investing in bitcoins. However, the actual risk of anyone hacking into the system today or in the near future is much lower than one might think it to be. The bitcoin itself is very difficult to hack into, and altering its value is protected by cryptographic functions (Baldwin, 2015). In addition, the public encryptions on the blockchain are so complicated that the power required to break that would be more than the power required to break down the entire bitcoin network, which makes the transactions extremely secure (Plassaras, 2013). 
	The last question to answer is whether the bitcoin can really succeed as a currency. Many argue that because bitcoin is not palpable, it does not qualify as a currency. But ever since this digital entity has been introduced to the world, it has grown in popularity, and today over 100,000 transactions take place per day (Blockchain.info, 2016), which shows that the bitcoin is successful as a currency. In Dowd and Hutchinson's (2015) example of Friedman's (1992) ""The Island of Stone Money"", the islanders use heavy stones shaped like disks to make payments. Instead of carrying it around as it was too heavy, the disks were placed in prominent places, and when ownership of the disk was to be passed on (similar to a bitcoin transaction), the owner would declare publicly of his transfer of ownership (similar to the recorded transactions on the blockchain). This decentralized system resembles that of the bitcoin network, which shows that the bitcoin can be used as a currency. 
Conclusion 
	The bitcoin achieves in holding anonymity and security between transactions, which helps to increase the number of investors in the digital market. It has grown in popularity which shows that more and more people are willing to invest in it, and that there is an element of trust in the bitcoin network and the decentralized system. Even though many do not agree it to be a currency, its widespread use today proves that it is indeed succeeding as a global currency, and has a brighter future in the long run. In terms of security, it is impossible to crack into the system presently and in the near future, but as technology is flourishing rapidly everyday, there is no doubt that there can be a foolproof system for the bitcoin network in the far future as well. As the world progresses into the future, the bitcoin will definitely surface to a wider audience of the world's population, as it is already a successful method for exchanging money. Of course, the choice of using bitcoins is up to each individual, and whether or not they use it, the bitcoin is bound to be a success in the future.

"School's Responsibility 1
Schools to Provide Nutritious Meals for Students
There is little doubt that this country is currently suffering from an epidemic so wide spread that it either directly or indirectly affects every person. There is one group in particular that is suffering the most, and that is children. Childhood obesity has more than ""doubled for preschool-aged children and adolescents, and tripled for children ages 6-11"" (Obesity, 2005). Numerous studies have been completed in an attempt to determine the main causes of this deadly disease. These studies conclude that the combination of overwhelming inactivity, excessive eating, genetic inheritance, and environmental factors are to blame for this upward trend in obesity. Of these factors, there is one that can be directly and immediately attacked, and that is excessive and unhealthy eating. It should be the primary job of a guardian to raise a healthy and successful child, however it has been found that parents are not doing what they need to in order to insure this. Therefore, it is the job of schools to provide healthy and nutritious meals to children.
As of 2005, there were ""approximately nine million children over the age of six years old that were considered obese"" (Obesity, 2005). The term ""Childhood Obesity"" is used to describe an individual who is between the ages of two and eighteen years of age who falls above the 95th percentile of the ""age-and gender-specific BMI charts developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention""(Obesity, 2005). Unfortunately, this upward trend in childhood obesity is not slowing down or even showing signs of
School's Responsibility 2
stabilizing, as can be seen in figure 1.
Figure 1: Adopted from Food Marketing and Childhood Obesity by Nestle, Marion.
According to the Institute of Medicine, in the year 2005 around 18 % of children were considered obese. Thirty-two years earlier, this number was 4 %. Not only is the prevalence of this disease getting worse by the year in terms of numbers of those suffering, but the distribution of body-mass index has shifted in a skewed fashion,
meaning that ""the heaviest children at any given time, that are at the greatest risk of complications, have become even heavier"" (Ebbeling, 2002). Obesity is a problem in and of itself by virtue of being an unnecessary and unnatural strain on the body, but there many other medical and emotional problems that can result.
School's Responsibility 3
The top medical concerns are Type 2 diabetes, which is defined as ""a chronic (lifelong) disease marked by high levels of sugar in the blood, beginning when the body does not respond correctly to insulin, a hormone released by the pancreas"" by the Medical Encyclopedia, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, menstrual abnormalities in
females, and orthopedic problems (Obesity, 2005). This is not all. It has been found that obesity affects nearly every part of the child's body, which is shown in figure 2.
Figure 2: Adopted from Teen and Childhood Obesity.
School's Responsibility 4
In addition, many obese children will face low self-esteem and negative body image issues, depression, negative stereotyping, discrimination, teasing, and bullying. According to Ebbeling from The Lancet, ""Overweight children as young as age 5 can
develop a negative self-image, and obese adolescents show declining degrees of self-esteem associated with sadness, loneliness, nervousness, and high-risk behaviors."" Schools can help to stop so many of these problems by simply teaching and implementing good nutritional values with students.
Many may question why the decision should not just be left up to the parents, but they are the one's doing this to their children. As Nestle explains in her article from the New England Journal of Medicine, ""at least 30 percent of the calories in the average child's diet are derived from sweets, soft drinks, salty snacks, and fast food, and soft drinks account for more than 10 % of the caloric intake."" And where are they receiving these items? From their parents. It is often assumed that since the parent or primary guardian loves the child, that they would automatically be providing appropriate and healthier lunches to their children. This has been disproved on numerous occasions. Birch, from the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, has stated that quite often children learn to eat based on what their parents/guardians are eating. In addition to simply learning eating habits from watching parents, children are ""predisposed to reject new foods and to have a preference for sweet tastes, salty tastes, and the rejection of sour and bitter tastes based on their parents"" (Birch, 1997). This means that if a parent is eating poorly, it is quite likely that their children are as well. If the parent is not aware of how to feed themselves correctly, it would be fair to assume that they do not have the
School's Responsibility 5
knowledge to feed their child appropriately. If the decision on what to eat is left up to the school, the child will be surrounded by good healthy options, and will most likely
develop a liking for these new foods, which they otherwise would not have been introduced to.
In a study done by Rogers from the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, similar discoveries were found. He conducted a 3-day long survey of six-hundred and twenty-one children from an average public elementary school. He proceeded to record whether the students were eating packed lunches, or buying the school foods, and then he analyzed all of the national food-based guidelines for children in that age group. These
guidelines included the ""recommended calorie intake, maximum desirable levels of fat, saturated fat, non-milk added sugars, and minimum levels of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins and minerals"" (Rogers, 2007).
The findings were shocking. On average, students who were eating only school-provided lunches were receiving more protein, fruits, vegetables, minerals, and vitamins, less total fat, saturated fat, trans fats, and sugar. In addition, ""the five most commonly consumed foods in packed lunches were white bread, fat spreads, crisps, sweet biscuits, and fruit."" While the study eventually concluded that neither the packed lunches, nor the school lunches, provided what the children needed, it was very clear that the school lunches were closer to meeting the dietary guidelines than those foods packed by parents.
Although it is clear that having parents provide healthy foods is not the best option, it is not to say that schools do not need to clean up their acts as well. It is becoming more necessary every year for educational establishments to get ""nutrition make-overs"" in order to meet the necessary dietary guidelines. One such school is the
School's Responsibility 6
Appleton Central Alternative Charter High School. This school was ""founded as a refuge for severely at risk students in grades 10-12 who were continually disruptive in class, frequently truant, struggled with psychological and emotional problems, and/or came
from dysfunctional home environments"" (Appleton, 2004). Originally, this school did not provide any sort of a meal program to their students. The only options that were
offered were foods and drinks from the vending machines, which students could buy during short breaks throughout the day. These foods included sodas, candy bars, chips, etc. While this system was in place, the staff often noted that the students had worse behavior after consuming these foods. That is when the school's principal was approached by a representative from The Nutrition and Wellness Program, who was
looking for a school to award their ""Peak Performance"" grant to. They decided to give the grant to the Appleton school in recognition of the high quality of ""caring for students' mental, emotional, and physical health."" The school was offered an experimental program to provide students with a ""healthy and natural breakfast and lunch"" at a reduced price or for free if the students could not afford it. The breakfasts included whole grain breads, granola, low-fat milk, and energy juices while the lunches consisted of ""a fresh entree, fresh fruit, a salad bar, whole grain breads, low-fat cookies for dessert, and an energy juice or milk.""
After these new foods and guidelines were implemented and in place for a couple of months, teachers were to take surveys and ask the students how they felt about the changes. ""The students generally accepted the changes with a simple explanation from a nutritional standpoint."" In addition, the staff pointed out that the ""students' disruptive behavior and health complaints diminished substantially, they seemed more able to
School's Responsibility 7
concentrate, there was a considerable decrease in impulsive behaviors such as talking out and use of foul language, there were fewer disciplinary referrals to the office, and the students were able to cover a greater amount of material at a more challenging level"" (Appleton, 2004). The great thing about systems such as this one being implemented is
that it can reach so many students at a time. If the decision is made by a parent to provide healthy foods, it will impact only a single, or maybe a few, children at a time. If
the school is the one providing healthy food alternatives, hundreds or even thousands of students will be affected positively.
Genevieve Clayton is a student at Northern Arizona Uinversity who attended the Glynn Academy for high school in Brunswick, Georgia. Her school implemented a similar program for their students. In a personal interview, Clayton stated that the school
""took away all the white flour and sugar from the school and the vending machines, and replaced all soda and drinks with the diet options."" She felt that although not all the students opted to eat the school lunches or the healthy options that they provided, it did make many students more aware of how to make nutritious choices. That is the key. As long as the students are receiving healthy meals, in addition to being taught about how to make healthy decisions, this problem will decrease rapidly. ""I did not agree with what they were doing at first, but after time I was grateful because if I did not want to bring lunch I still had healthy choices at school.""
Although parents care immensely about their children, and this is not being questioned, they are simply not educated enough on nutrition to be providing their kids with appropriate meals. When left to their own devices, parents are sending their children into school with meals that are full of sugared sodas, candy, white bread, and fat,
School's Responsibility 8
leading to the sharp increase in childhood obesity over the past few decades. If the decision of what to feed children is left up to schools, and those schools have undergone their ""make-over"" to meet dietary guidelines, the number of children suffering from obesity will drop dramatically. In addition to simply feeding children the correct foods, schools need to be providing classes on nutrition. The more knowledgeable this
generation becomes, the more information they can pass on to future generations. Let's stop childhood obesity in its tracks.

Funding of Student Organizations 
My argumentative paper is going to cover student organizations and their contributions to the students and university as a whole. ""Getting and staying involved is one of the most important things you can do while in college. ""Involvement"" is defined as any activity outside the classroom which enhances and contributes to student learning"" (Michigan State University's Benefits of Involvement, 2010). Universities all over country have countless organizations and clubs sponsored by the university itself or covering up their own costs through specific fees established by the group and taken from the members of the group. Students, teachers, and parents expect that membership in these organizations will result in learning and enhanced skills as well as the development of positive values, social skills, and an ability to work independently and collaboratively (Vaughn, Kieth, Lockaby & Williams 1999). The latter usually occurs when universities refuse to cover the cost of the activities of student organizations or only fund them partially. Therefore, the organizations that are not funded properly cannot be as efficient and as helpful to the students and contribute much to campus life. I am convinced that the universities have to cover the full cost of the student organizations and help sustain their status and their activities for several reasons such as student comfort, community benefits, and university reputation. 
	Universities value their students and want them to stay happy and healthy. Clubs and student organizations give students a chance to socialize extensively and find likeminded people to keep them company and provide moral support when needed (Slick, 2007). The groups usually host get-together parties and do different projects to improve both their own lives and the lives of those around them. Being together with their companions makes students feel content in their lives and do better in school, which leads to them being more functional as human beings. For example, it is statistically proven that participants of Greek life are more successful in life than the students who do not participate in any organizations. Greek life, more than other clubs, brings people together by binding them through various activities, light hazing, and countless memories alongside their brothers and sisters. 
While student organizations function primarily to gather likeminded people, groups also get together to better the community and society in general. However, this is not all groups have to offer. In fact, student associations often help those in need and host cultural events that educate people around them on current issues and diversity in general. Moreover, student associations usually volunteer at social events and do community service projects. For example, the participants of habitat for humanity often travel to remote destinations in order to improve ordinary lives of underprivileged people from impoverished areas, such as multiple countries in Africa. As Mahambet Aitkaly mentioned in his interview, service is very important to university associations. The Kazakh organization constantly participates in various fundraisers as well as donates blood once a year as a group. If Purdue university provides those groups with money that commit to offering service to others, more groups could afford to help others and therefore make the world a better place. 
	Since students compose the majority of the universities' residents and the universities need to stay attractive to the students in order to function, it is important for the universities to stay sound. Having a diversity of clubs shows how well rounded the university is and how much attention they pay to their student body. Funding those clubs is a logical way to support development on campus and overall globalization. If there were no clubs or no clubs funded by the university, people with similar backgrounds and hobbies but in different majors may have never met. As MA suggested in the interview, the organizations make students feel more at home. For example, the Kazakh association always looks after its participants and takes care of the newly arrived students. The older members of the group organize trips to Walmart, help with scheduling classes and even make sure the students plan their residential options beforehand. Oftentimes, they end up living close by one another to provide maximum support. Moreover, the students can be a way to advertise the university, and happy students are the best advertisement and reputation booster for the university. 
	Some people think that institutions can not sponsor every organization simply because there are not enough funds. There are too many communities and organizations, therefore, universities would rather spend money they have on research and innovations. However, if we took the student tuition into consideration, it would average out to be around 30,000$ per student per year. With such an immense amount of money, one would formulate the idea that universities should have the required funds to subsidize these organizations on campus. Usually, universities have a budget system and should be able to save a certain amount of money for these clubs. 
	Additionally, some funders believe that as a top research university, Purdue should make no effort in aiding recreational clubs. This is because recreational clubs are not beneficial to the university's efforts in more ""serious"" goals. However, it is important for students on campus to search for their interests. This not only builds themselves as future leaders, but also improves their resumes. Most employers and interviewers look for students that get actively involved in student organizations. The students that participate in various activities are more likely to stand out. However, if universities do not fund such clubs, then in what other ways can a student practice to develop their interpersonal skills. According to multiple surveys, students engaged in a variety of clubs are three times more likely to not only get an internship early in their careers, but also gain more job experience and therefore be able to qualify for a higher position in a career ladder. 
	Students in universities tend to prioritize their studies first and leave getting involved on campus last. This belief lessens the demand for joining organizations and reduces students' time committing to extracurricular activities. With that, sponsors and funders make no effort to fund these clubs, but instead fund more ""academic"" organizations since that is what the students prefer. Research and studies show that students who take no breaks while studying tend to perform worse academically. However, if the university makes an effort to fund recreational clubs, then there would be more incentives for students to participate. With this, students' grades start to improve. 
	There will always be an ongoing debate about whether universities should be heavily involved in funding student organizations or fund their resources in other activities on campus. However, according to my research, I have concluded that universities should fund student organizations more often. The reason being is because it not only helps the students' social life, but also benefits the university and society conclusively.

The Temporal Lobe Theory about D j vu 
D j vu is a curious phenomenon, but it happens constantly. In daily life, many people have special feelings that they are familiar with current sensation, but they may never came the places before or they did not do same things before. This feeling is caused by D j vu. Scientists have researched the reason of d j vu for many years, but they also could not get right answer. Most of the scientists support the temporal lobe theory which suggest that the temporal lobe is the main reason of d j vu. There also some scientists support other theories, such as six sense theory, spirit theory and time tunnel theory. Because of the evidence and scientifically explanation, I think the temporal lobe theory is correct. 
From the interview, I know the temporal lobe theory was found by a scientists who searched the d j vu by observing the patients of epilepsy. In the research, people who had epilepsy were easier to had d j vu than normal persons. The temporal lobe relate to memory and emotion, so if the temporal lobe damage, the memory may be disordered. The research suggest that the d j vu was caused by memory disorder. In addition the symptoms of patients who damaged their temporal lobe is balderdash, psychomotor excitement, spatial disorientation, emotional disorder, memory disturbance etc. The memory disturbance is the evidence to show the relationship between d j vu and epilepsy. The memory disturbance is a special symptom which cause patients distinguish the recently memories, the memories long ago and the present memories difficultly, because in their memories, the places and time were always absented. The patients also put some imagines in their memories which caused their memories became more blurred. The interview strongly support the temporal lobe theory. 
In the article ""D j Vu in Neurology"", Edward Wild mainly mentions the topic Neuroanatomy and give the evidence of the temporal lobe theory. In 20th century, the scientists found the organ which related to d j Vu was temporal lobe. Mullan and Penfield found when they were doing temporal lobe resection, the epileptic patients elicited a ""dreamy state"" akin to d j vu. In 1982, Gloor and colleagues used a new equipment to stimulate the organ in epileptic patients wanted to reproduce the phenomenon, but they did not succeed. In the late 20th century, Bancaud gave a new theory, he thought that neural network in the association cortex and limbic areas encodes the holistic experience of an event. In the theory, d j vu is caused by inappropriate activation of deep memory structures by superficial sensory structure. In 1999 Adachi et al. used positron tomography to study the function of temporal lobe. They compared the patients with d j vu and patients without d j vu. They found the patients who had experience about d j vu, their glucose metabolism in temporal cortex reduced. The conclusion of this finding was the temporal lobe was necessary but not sufficient for generating d j vu. The article in psychology today give the evidence of the theory of temporal lobe. 
Although many scientists believe the temporal lobe theory is the most scientific explanation, there are also some scientists propose different theories. In the article ""How D j Vu Works"", Lee Ann Obringer introduces other theories about d j vu. She mentions a new theory about d j vu. If people try to remember something, the brain will divided the whole picture in to small fragments. The smaller the fragments are, the fuzzier the memory is. When people meet analogous fragment, like a sign, a smell or a sound, the brain recreates picture and makes people feel familiar. Another theory is based on how brain stores long-term and short-term memories. Robert Efron proposed an theory which are also valid today,."" In Efron theory, the temporal lobe which in the left brain, response to sort the memories. But temporal lobe received information twice, one direct form left brain, another from right brain. The information from right brain was delay. When delay is a little bit longer, the brain puts two information into different time period. It means people feel familiar with the sense they have just seen. The third theory tells that people get the information from other sources, such as videos, books or pictures. When people experience similar situation, they might have the experience of d j vu. These theories have their rational Interpretations but their theories do not have efficient evidences. These theories all base on hypothesis, the scientists use these theories to explain the phenomenon of d j vu. The explanations sound like reasonable, but scientists do not have enough experiments or data to prove their theories. So I prefer to support the temporal lobe theory. 
In the article ""The Psychology of.D j vu"", Joshua Foer introduces the d j vu was classified in d j entendu (already heard), d j senti (already smelled), d j lu (already read), and d j v cu (already lived). In the past, when d j vu was just found, many psychologists began the researches about d j vu, but they gradually found that d j vu only happened in a second without obvious behaviors. It was difficult for them to do enough observations. That caused many unscientific theories occur. In order to find the real theory of d j vu, an experiment of d j vu was set up by O'Connor. In the experiment, the researchers put subjects in a soundproof room and hypnotized them. The computer read 20 words, some of them were normal, others were abnormal. After a while, the subjects woke up and saw those 20 words, nearly 40 percent of the subjects say they feel d j vu. There is also another experiment. Two professor, Brown worked in Southern Methodist University and Elizabeth Marsh worked in Duke University, made an experiment, they showed their students pictures which were taken at the other professor's campus. After three weeks, they show some of the pictures to those students, many students said they seemed to go to the campus before, but they have never gone there. This is the the phenomenon of d j vu, the experiment showed nearly 89 percent of students had the feeling of d j vu. The two experiments used different ways to show that d j vu was really exist, not because of sixth sense or other outer factors, but related to the organ in the brain. The article denies other theories and proves the temporal lobe theory. 
D j vu is a really remarkable phenomenon. Many scientists do the research about d j vu to find appropriate explanations. Although there are many theories about d j vu, I only support the temporal lobe theory. Because the theory not only have many scientific explanation, but also have been proven by many experiments. So the temporal lobe theory is more scientific and credible.

"A Cruel Research- Extended Argument Essay
Picture this in your mind, in the future you and your spouse are having problems with pregnancy. You desperately want a child, but there are complications, the only solution is in vitro fertilization. You arrive at the clinic and go through the procedure. In time, the fertilization is successful. You have the potential for life, an embryo that can become your precious baby. Now the last thing to be done is to determine what will happen to the extra embryos that have been created. The doctor comes in with a consent form. 'You can donate these unused embryos to research that can save lives' he tells you. At this point, you think, I want to save lives and you sign the consent form and send your embryos to the nearest stem cell research plant. But what happens to embryos that are elected for stem cell research? There are other options for stem cell research that do not require the dismembering of human embryos. Embryonic stem cell research is destructive and murderous.
Embryonic stem cell testing has become a popular research among most scientists,
the reason behind this is because they are so moldable. Theoretically embryonic stem cells can be used to fulfill any function that your body needs. But what many people do not know is that in order to attain these stem cells you have to dismember and kill the embryo that you take them from. I feel that this is grossly wrong. New technologies have been discovered that make testing embryonic stem cells look primitive. There are new advances in science that eclipse the use of embryonic stem cells entirely. If there is an option that allows you to save more than you kill I feel strongly about it. Stem Cells can be used to cure all types of infirmities and diseases, with more research. But when the treatment of these infirmities requires you to dismember and destroy human embryos, are you not first killing to preserve the life of others. Embryos are the potential of life, they grow to become babies. To use embryonic stem cells, when you have to kill them in order to do so, is wrong; especially when new advances are more efficient and do not require the use of embryonic involvement.
Many people are uneducated about stem cells so they care little about the research. In his book, The Unity of Form and Function, Kenneth Saladin explains what stem cells are, he defined them as, ""undifferentiated cells that are not yet performing any specialized
function, but that have the potential to differentiate into one or more types of mature functional cells, such as liver, brain, cartilage, or skin cells""(Kenneth Saladin). He continues, "" The growth and differentiation of tissues depends upon a supply of reserve stem cells""(Kenneth Saladin). This means that all of the tissues in your body came from stem cells and the body's ability to repair itself after having severe trauma depends on having a ready supply of stem cells that can be used. There are two types of these stem cells, adult and embryonic. Embryonic stem(ES) cells have the ability to differentiate, split, into any tissue type that the body needs. Adult stem(AS) cells are more specialized for distribution and can only split to create certain types of tissues.
An example of a stem cell's potential is outlined by author Jeffrey Kluger, in an issue of Time Europe. ""Stem cells. have the potential to treat an astonishing range of ills, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's and spinal-cord injuries"" (Time Europe, 2001). Stem cells can help to cure these, now incurable, debilitating diseases. These cells can be tested to alleviate the suffering of many. This is why research in this field is so important to the Scientific community. If there is a way to help an aged grandfather regain his memory I support it. This is why embryonic cells have such a
potential for science, they can still divide into all of the tissues in your body, including the ones that wear down with age. With the advancing of therapies and infusions of young stem cells the aging process can be halted and life can be extended far past the age of the mid 70's to late 80's.
However, this wonderful aspiration is where the split divides, this is a controversial topic for American people. Embryonic testing is an issue between pro-life supporters and what science deems a necessary loss. My support lies with those that support life. As I have stated, the harvesting of embryonic stem cells destroys the embryo. In doing this you kill the 'potential' of human life. Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal describes the process of extracting stem cells from the embryo. ""Embryonic stem cells are derived from a living embryo through immunosurgical procedures that dissolve its outer membrane in order to expose the inner cell mass from which embryonic stem cells are extracted, before being cultured and induced to differentiate. The embryo quite literally is dismembered""(Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal). These embryos, if not scheduled for testing will grow into human children. I ask the question, if it is wrong to kill an innocent, a child that plays baseball with some friends in the field by your house, then is it also
wrong, on a smaller level, to kill a smaller form of that child. Human embryos are the start of human beings, naturally they grow to become adults if they are allowed.
This argument was particularly pronounced during George W. Bush's Presidency. In August 2001, President Bush placed high restrictions on the federal funding of Stem Cell Research plants, to appease pro-life petitioners. His bill outlined that no federal funding would be provided to the research done in new testing facilities. Bush was under scrutiny for this act, as shown in The New York Times, ""he tried to steer an inoffensive course by limiting but not banning federal funding for stem cell studies. Unfortunately, he made the limitations much too tight by agreeing to finance only research on stem cell lines that had been created as of August 2001 from surplus embryos at fertility clinics. No new lines, either from surplus embryos subsequently generated at clinics or from other sources, would be eligible for federal support"" (New York Times, October 2002). This bill made it so that any scientists that harvested stem cells after August of 2001 had to find private funding. This private funding usually meant hours of searching for sponsors who both, believed in the research, and had enough money to buy the expensive equipment that is required for these procedures.
Scientific advancements in this country were nearly halted completely. Simona Giordano, a lead scientist, said, ""Stem cell research represents the most promising field of investigation for treatment of many degenerative diseases. The veto against research condemns millions of people to a life with little hope of cure"" (Simona Giordano). With out the necessary funding from the government, expensive tools needed to continue the research that many had started, could not be purchased. Labs closed down because with out Federal Grant money they could not continue the research. Scientists could no longer experiment to find a cure for the debilitating diseases that had caused them to begin research in the first place. In passing the bill, America was no longer considered the leader of the modern world, as far as health was concerned.
Marlene Cimons speaks out against Bush's decision, to limit the funding for embryonic stem cell research plants, by denouncing his supposed political platform. ""By doing so, the president is standing in the way of achieving the goal he professed to be aiming for: creating new therapeutic approaches to life threatening diseases. He does not understand that the so-called stem-cell lines he approved in 2001 do not exist, or are not available for the research to develop those therapies"" (Nature Medicine). By going against
the political platform that he was elected for he received many accusations, like this one about his motives. In limiting governmental funding due to pro-life affiliates and religious activists he became scrutinized by the scientific world.
Similar to the political struggle Bush went through, scientists struggle with religious activists that proclaim there is a certain moral code that must be followed in these situations. Mark Brown, of the Kennedy Institute Ethics Journal, explains the stretch that these activists are willing to go to decree moral and political correctness; ""traditional moral complicity theory holds that, under certain conditions, those who participate in cooperative activity that is morally evil may be held responsible as accomplices... Unless one retreats into moral isolation, shunning evil in all forms, one cannot escape participating in the historical injustices that shaped the modern world"" (Kennedy Institute Ethics Journal, Mark Brown). He continues to say that if this is the case than anyone who consumes food that has been transported by rail train in the United States is condemned because trains that carry needed goods were built off of the slave labor of early immigrants from China. His comparison demonstrates how this form of thinking can get severely out of hand. He is essentially saying that, to consider an embryo
a human life is far too much of a stretch to be justified logically. He draws the conclusion that because a human embryo cannot survive on its own, without its mother's nutrition and feeding, such an organism is neither human nor a living thing yet.
However, there is one vital problem with embryonic stem cell research that many do not consider; there have been no successful human transplants from embryonic stem cells. This research is ineffective, in its purposes to cure diseases, as many scientists do not want to put their patient's in danger, "".many scientists believe that putting stem-cell-derived tissues into patients lies a long way off. Embryonic stem cells have their drawbacks. They cause tumors and adult cells derived from them may be rejected by the patient's immune system. Furthermore, whatever disease process caused the patient's tissue cells to die is likely to kill introduced cells as well. All these problems may be solvable, but so far none have been solved"" (New York Times, March 2009). This danger to the host is unnecessary, and risky, as most host's bodies have an already compromised immune system. This makes them easy targets for infection and cancers that their body cannot fight off in its weakened condition. It is dangerous at this point to use embryonic stem cell implants.
With new technologies there is a solution, one that requires no involvement of embryonic stem cells. The New York Times tells of a Japanese biologist that made an important discovery which may finally end this controversial conflict. The report states, ""the Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka found in 2007 that adult cells could be reprogrammed to an embryonic state with surprising ease. This technology 'may eventually eclipse the embryonic stem cell lines for therapeutic as well as diagnostics applications,' Dr. Kriegstein said. For researchers, reprogramming an adult cell can be much more convenient, and there have never been any restrictions on working with adult stem cells"" (New York Times, March 2009). With this new technology there is no need to use embryonic stem cells at all. Adult stem cells can be extracted without harm to the adult's body and thus killing is not required to research cures for these diseases.
Since then more discoveries of revolutionary procedures have been discovered, Melinda Wenner wrote about a new procedure discovered in November of 2007 which turned, ""ordinary adult skin cells into pluripotent stem cells-capable of becoming any kind of tissue-a feat that could solve the ethical problem forever"" (Popular Science, Melinda Wenner). This discovery can allow many scientists to change their research, and
no longer operate and dismember young embryonic cells. They can begin the new and more effective approach of reprogramming existing adult cells.
On the subject of these two amazing teams of scientists, Richard Monastersky discusses options that the scientific community can now act on, ""two teams of scientists reported . that they had developed lines of human stem cells almost identical to embryonic ones, using a procedure that does not involve destroying actual embryos"" (Chronicle of Higher Education, Richard Monastersky). This option to delay and maybe alleviate the need to work with embryonic stem cells is good news to pro-life affiliates as well as scientists. A sort-of middle ground now exists that everyone can strive for. There is a way to find a cure for these diseases and that way involves new technology that will not harm any form of life.
There are many uses of stem cells and many cures to be found with more research. However, testing on embryonic stem cells is an unnecessary loss that should be eclipsed. If there were no other choice than to test on embryonic stem cells then the cause of so many thousand people suffering may be enough. But there is now another option. There are new technologies that make embryonic testing seem primitive and outdated, an
unnecessary exploitation of the potential of life. There is a better cure, there is a more advanced way. These alternatives lie in testing new technologies that are better for everyone. There is no need to sacrifice life for the greater good, when a more advanced, safer option is on the horizon.

Human Development of Quick Decision Making 
""More than half children use social media by the age of 10"". Media has become a part of people's daily life, in a job, in the school or in college. It is something normal for societies, but not everyone realizes how it can affect on people's decisions. Through a survey 40 people between the ages of 16-70 answered the question ""Does social media affect your decisions?"". The responses were, a 34.2% said yes, a 42.1% said no and a 23.7% said sometimes. Even though almost half of the people think that social media does not affect their decisions it actually does. 
One of the main influences in people's life is the television. The TV was invented 172 years ago. Right now is one of the most used device in the world. According to researches (Gale, 2007) the television influences and has an impact on viewer's attitudes and beliefs about themselves. It also affects the viewer perception of cultures and social backgrounds. It has also influenced during history how people think about race, gender and class. It is also proved that it has made people more materialists and has helped in political campaigns. According to this facts, the television has had and has a direct impact in shaping how we think, therefore our decisions. For example, a technique used to persuade people to buy is the repetition of commercials. When people turn the TV on it is very probable that the same commercial will show up several times. People may not notice that this actually affects them, but it does. They will have that commercial recorded in their minds which will probably make them want to buy that product. 	 
The television not only affects on buying, but it also affects on our perception of different cultures. As mostly everyone watches the TV and the news it is very easy to persuade people to think how the TV is presenting a social issue. In Europe, for example, when there is a crime committed by someone of the same race as Europeans the new is not very polemical. However, if someone from a different country or background commits a crime medial will do whatever they can to make sure everyone knows and is alert. This make people think wrong and different od other cultures and countries. 
Another sort of media we are exposed to is the Internet. Every day google has approximately 4. 7 trillion searches. People now have all the information wanted in a simple click. This is creating that the human brain develops more the prefrontal cortex in the brain which is in charge of short term memory and quick decision making. The brain does what it is trained to do so even if people wanted to learn something from the internet the brain is predisposed to forget almost everything people search for on google. People are losing the long term memory. Taking these facts into account, it is known that people are more likely to make quick decisions nowadays. This is not something that is positive for the human being. Making quick decisions can affect in a negative way to our lifestyle and society. For example, people tend to believe everything found on a web page. It is proved that even web pages like Wikipedia are not 100% verdict. However, people still believe everything that is written there. 
As it happens with the TV, internet also affects on people's perception towards race, gender and class. This is because there is a lot of fake information available for everyone in the internet. Also there are commercials which change our perceptions on how we think about ourselves, like the ones made to loose weight or look pretty for the society. All these commercials have an impact on people, they can change how the feel and think, therefore it changes their decisions. 
A study conducted by the University of Southern California and the University of Berkeley, demonstrated that social media is also beneficial for the human being. ""The study looked at more than 5,000 hours of online observation and found that the digital world is creating new opportunities for young people to grapple with social norms, explore interests, develop technical skills and work on new forms of self-expression"" They believe that social media is essential for kids to develop social and technical skills. However, they do not deny that social media affects people's decisions. 
In conclusion, the Media is a powerful source in people's life. It is currently in everybody's day through television, internet or even commercials. It is demonstrated that media affects and has been affection for a long time how people think about race, gender and social class. It creates conflicts and misunderstandings between counties and cultures. It also makes the human being develop the prefrontal cortex of the brain which improves the short term memory and the the quick decision making. Media affects directly to people and how thet make decisions.

"P5D1 Argumentative Essay 
April 16th, 2015 
The Electronic Books Should be Promoted in Campus 
Since the development of technology, people are able to have mobile computers and they can read text though their laptop and tablet. Electronic books, an evolutionary idea from about ten years ago, have become feasible, bringing a probability that carrying over thousands books in pocket. Thus, for students' convenience, universities should consider to promote electronic textbooks for not only reducing the purchase on textbooks but also the weight on shoulders. 
Tuition and resident fee are not only thing to be considered. According to The College Board, the annual cost of textbooks and other course materials for a four-year college student is about one thousand and two hundred dollars. Take me as an example, I spend six hundred dollar five hundred dollars to buy textbooks last semester. A thousand dollars are much smaller than tuition but the purchase of books does increase the cost of going to colleges, making the financial situation worse for students who have educational loan. Moreover, textbooks priced in hundreds dollars would become worthless after finishing courses unless students sold to other who need. Even though renting or buying used books for discounted price is an option, there is still a possibility that the supply is not able to satisfy the demand. Comparatively, without the concern of material and printing, electronic textbooks take an advantage in both price and supplement. 
Some people argue that several market facts, such as the revenue, influence the price of electronic books and they are sold with a little discount. For instant, a books priced a hundred and fifty dollars only have a thirty-dollar cut off in electronic. Universities take their responsibility by getting involve the electronic books project. Purdue Universities is one of the first universities which shows its interest on electronic books and sold textbooks online with Amazon, a famous electronic commerce company. What is more, Purdue recently has a trial project about electronic books call ""The e Text Pilot"". The e Text Pilots sells electronic textbooks in averagely twenty dollars and provides assistance to certain instructors and courses that advocate the use of electronic books. 
Electronic books take advantage besides the price. A normal textbook often weights in several pounds. Many students complain they are tired of take a help bag full of books. In fact, they only need to read a few content in books every time, which means they waste their energy on carrying useless papers all the day. Additionally, paper books also need lots of space for storage, usually a bookshelf or boxes. Although some have suggested to separate cumbersome books in parts to sell, it seems to have a lot trouble on buying a large number of books. Therefore, an electronic reading devices can be the best solution. Light and small as a magazine, a reading devices usually are able to store overs thousand books in TXT format or hundreds in PDF format. People can put devices wherever they want-bags, pockets or hands. Except certain reading devices, people still can read from their tablet, laptop or even cellphones. In addition, thanks to the emerging display technology, some devices have the feature that text on the screen seems to like reading paper books. 
Bringing portability, reading devices give people convenience with concern. Some people argue that using electronic devices would make students distract from class when they pay their attention on tapping and scrolling, let alone reading novel in class. For an instructor, it is impossible to keep eyes on every students' behavior while teaching. Using such reading devices could affect the class efficiency. I admit that student would not always stay focus on class, but when I was in class, most of my behavior is listening to instructor, taking notes and trying to understand the class content. I do not have to read textbooks. Normally, reading tasks are done before class. Thus, using devices perhaps have influence on class. It still depends on how students use the devices. 
Nowadays, many people have shown their will for a change on heavy and expensive textbooks. In the age of information technology, efficiency has already become on crucial measurement of competitive power. Electronic books save not only money but also time for students, bring a lager possibility to succeed.

"Campus Work is Beneficial for College Student 
Campus Work is Beneficial for College Students 
		""I absolutely love working on campus!"" (Personal communication, Oct 20, 2014) Hou, one of my interviewees who are currently working for Purdue University, said this during an interview meeting with me. In recent years, number of students who are employees of their colleges had increased significantly. According to the journal published by National Center for Educational Statistics, 79% of undergraduates worked during 2007-2008 while they were enrolled (Lucier, 2012, p.3). Students may choose to work for different personal reasons such as to offset the high cost of tuition, or it could just be plain desires to work (p.5). However, as campus working became prevalent among college students, whether or not it is beneficial for students to work for their colleges was the important question to ask. After interviewing two student employees from Purdue University and read through five articles of relevant topics, I found out that although working on campus have its disadvantages such as fairly low salaries for student workers and most student employees' academic grades tended to decline (Reynolds, 2014), the benefits of applying for job on campus was greater. Because working on campus was more flexible on student's schedules, could expand student's social circles, and could arm students with professional skills for their future careers. 
		Campus job usually have multiple and flexible working shifts for student employees in order to avoid interfering with their class schedules. Most colleges understand the top priorities of students are to study, gain and maintain good grades, so they would try to design or find working shifts that fit their student worker's schedules as much as possible. In the article, Should My College Student Look For a On-Campus Job or Off Campus, the fact was presented that the colleges know the obligations and concerns of their student employees, so they would excuse their student employees from missing works because of preparing for tests or having to complete group projects for classes. Besides, most job that are available to students on campus are normally closed during school breaks or holidays, which fit students schedule perfectly unlike off-campus job may ask their employees to keep working during certain holiday times (p.5). What's more, students who work on campus are easier to find a substitute for his/her work shift than those who work off campus due to the larger base number of students who work on campus (p.7). Therefore, students who work on campus would have a more flexible schedule. 
		College students are likely to meet more people thus expanding their social circles during campus work. Because students work with other students from all over campus and all kinds of majors, they would have plenty chances to meet new people and make friends with them. My interviewees, Hou and Le, both told me that through work, they met many amazing people and became friends with them (Personal communication, Oct 21, 2014). They both argued that if not working together, they would never meet these amazing individuals in their daily life. Moreover, as Lucier (2012) stated that working on campus is an excellent way to increase student worker's sense of belonging. To be more specific, working in an institution with other students and staffs are likely to make students employees to feel they are parts of the big family (p.4). ""Not only through my coworkers but just the customers themselves remembering my face and acknowledging me on campus."" said Kyra Bannister, a junior at the University of Oregon (p.5). In this case, student workers could expand their social circles not only within their workmates but also among their customers. 
		Working on campus is likely to bring students the gift of professional skills. While working on campus, students are trained with communication skills, team-working skills, time managing skills and customer service skills (Lucier 2012, p.8). For example, my interviewee, Hou, told me a story about him when he first worked at Purdue Earhart Dinning Court. Because Hou is an international student, he could not communicate with others really well. So Hou expressed his concern to the coordinator and the coordinator decided to train him by putting him into the stirring fry section. The stirring fry section is the place customers order their fried meat so Hou had to communicate with both customers and his co-workers consistently. By working there, Hou's English speaking skill improved significantly and he said he had no fear of communicating with American workmates in his future jobs (Personal communication, Oct 20, 2014). Besides, My other interviewee, Le, argued that team-working skills are essential for student employees because no company nowadays would hire a person who does not know how to cooperate with others. He stated that being a teaching assistant at Purdue taught him how to work with other TAs and the professors together to teach a class and he felt this skill was a treasure to him (Personal communication, Oct 21, 2014). In addition, Palmer and Bray (2008) supported this argument by stating that working on campus would give students great advantages in competing with other candidates in applying for a job in the future. 
		In brief, working on campus is definitely beneficial for students on multiple aspects. Campus jobs are more suitable for student's academic schedule than other works; student workers would have many opportunities to meet new friends at work and thus enlarging their social life; most importantly, campus work is a preparation for college students who are about to step into the real world because it arms students with professional technique and skills that are invaluable for students. Granted, campus job does have its disadvantages like unsatisfactory payments and mostly declined academic grades of student employees (Reynolds, 2014). However, these problems can be fixed because the wage of students payment have the potential to grow through promotion (Megan, 2014) and if students learn how to balance their study time and work time, their grades would stop declining. Additionally, professor Laura Perna has actually found out that students who work are more persistent to pursue their academic success than those who do not (Lucier 2012, p.3). Therefore, working on campus could be great experiences for college students for it could give students skills or network that are invaluable for the rest of their lives.

Death Penalty in China 
	Death penalty is a great part of human history to ensure the integrity of law as one of the oldest penalties in the world. And given different conditions in different countries, each treated this differently. Over 100 countries all over the world abolished death penalty within their country and advocated for more countries to abolish this severe punishment like them. Aware of the world trend, Chinese people started to talk more about the future of death penalty in China. Different views were presented in the debate. But as far as I concerned, I believe that the abolishment of death penalty will happen but not in a short while. I will provide reasons below to support my opinion over this topic. 
	First of all, as the history goes from 1786 when European countries started to take real actions to abolish death penalty after the idea first brought out by the Great Duke of Tuscany, more and more countries give consideration to this proposal and join the team to abandon death penalty. As suggested by Ingrid (2013) in her paper Historical Evolution of the Death Penalty Abolition as a Fundamental Human Right, after the idea was first brought out, countries have started to abolish death penalty after long time debate as their development provide a solid base for such action to take place. According to Leila Haddou (2014, March 27) on the Guardian website, the total death penalty carried out in 2012 is less than those carried out in 2011. And this decrease gave further proof to the world wide trend of giving up on the use of death penalty. Also proved in Wikipedia article Capital Punishment by Country (""Capital Punishment"", 2015, December 8), great number of countries have abolished death penalty in the past decades. Those number collected better proved the fact that the restriction in the use of death penalty and the abolishment of death penalty has become a world trend in protection of human rights. 
	Secondly, China's government showed great interest to achieve such a goal to abolish death penalty in China through past years. Though the number of sentences and execution taken out of death penalty has been kept secrets by the government, the number of reported death penalty dropped over years and most of them are not sentenced with a suspension period instead of immediate execution. As reported by Chris Hogg (2011, February 25) on BBC News, 13 crimes that used to face death penalty have been removed form the originated list of 68 crimes punishable by death. Furthermore, ""The president of China's Supreme People's Court has made it a priority to reduce the number of wrongful convictions, part of a broader effort by Beijing to improve public faith in the country's legal system. written by Josh Chin (2014, December 15) reported in the Wall Street Journal in the article ""China Court Reverses Death Penalty Verdict, 18 Years Too Late."" As mentioned in the article, the Mongolia High People's Court sincerely apologized to the parents of Huugjilt, who was executed in 1996 at the age of 18. And therefore the government is trying to make fewer mistakes and be more cautious when giving death sentence and executing in death sentenced criminals. 
	Last, as mentioned in the beginning this abolish of death penalty will not happen shortly due to the circumstances of China. <name>, a lawyer I interviewed previously on this topic further confirmed this by saying ""The basic requirement for a country to abolish the death penalty is a stable social environment where economic is advanced, people are well-educated and everyone can make a living easily. Also, people should have the ability to tell right from wrong and able to behave."" (<name>, personal communication, December 20, 2015). Also in the paper ""Destiny of the Death Penalty in China in the Contemporary Era"", the writer Xiangliang (2006), mentioned such things as social existences and social consciousness and indicated them as basic ground for the abolishment of death penalty to happen. For those conditions China's society failed provide right now, the abolishment is likely to happen in the post 21 century as it develops to a level where all those conditions may be fulfilling to abolish death penalty. 
	On the other hand, some may argue the death penalty should not be abolished since the deterrence power of law will decrease and thus people feel there are less serious consequences for them to commit crimes they may commit more crimes. However, it is proven that the deterrence power has been overrated. According to Yuanhuang (2009), the deterrence power has different power in different time frame, but the overall effect it has over the crime rate is not straightly related. 
	In conclusion, I believe that the death penalty will be abolished in China over time since the worldwide trend of doing so and the gradually procedures China's government taken on the way to reach this goal. And the abolishment will happen at the proper time when the desired conditions are provided with the development achieved in economic and society in the future.

Long-Argumentative Paper
""Tornadoes: Is technology up to pare with unpredictable/ uncontrollable weather?""
The wind howls outside, as the clouds begin to creep in silently. While many are sleeping, a devastating disaster is approaching and brewing in the clouds above their homes. The sky growls with thunder and strikes out with lighting at anything within its path, this is only the beginning. However, this lightning thunderstorm, takes a frightening turn; the air about the city changes and the rain is quickly turns into large hailstones the size of golf balls that has the potential of ripping holes through roofs and through windshields. The wind picks up; going up in terrifying speeds and begins to uproot trees. This becomes the beginning of a severe storm. The whole atmosphere just freezes in time as the wind stops and it seems as though life besides humans has gone missing. The scent of sulfur before the storm covers the air with a mist as it takes its worst turn. Developing rainstorms have strong lighting, as the storms often destroy houses and other establishments. They happen not only on a global scale, but local as well. The winds boost and destroy houses and the hail from the storms cause property damage, which leaves the town in shambles. Although there are sirens they are often muffled by the sounds of high-powered winds. People scramble out of bed and hurry to areas where there aren't any windows, like basements or safe rooms. Tornadoes are the most destructive weather forms in society, unpredictable and hard to determine why they form. They can start with just the simplest of rainstorms that can turn deadly.
The Doppler Radar system is the current detector for locating any developing severe storm. However, the position of the Doppler is higher off the ground and closer to the troposphere. The troposphere can identify dew points, rising temperatures that fall and weather that is taking place. When the Doppler identifies the storm the storm is already in progress and the advanced warning systems are only allowing twelve-minute reaction times for people to get to safety. By lowering the Doppler's closer to the ground where tornadoes develop from the ground up, it could help siren readiness faster and saving the lives of many.
Tornadoes are deadliest and most unpredictable weather forms that have ever been tracked on a radar system. Unlike hurricanes that can't be monitored for a longer periods and determined at the direct location it is going to hit. In spite of everything they can take place in the day or at night or even in the winter from recent studies. The main question that many meteorologists are still determining is why do they form at all? However, what they currently know is all ""tornadoes go through similar stages in development"" (Keller 254 ""The first is ""dust-whirl stage,"" As dust is slowly picked up off the ground, it then creates a funnel cloud from the thunderstorm in the progress. The second stage is called, ""organizing stage,"" the supercell that has a developing tornado inside begins to rotate and intensifies. The third stage is the, "" mature stage,"" this is a damaging state where the funnel cloud widens and pull up into a vertical position perfect for the structure to develop from the updrafts and downdrafted air. The fourth stage is called, ""shrinking stage,"" where the tornado beings to tilt and picks up speed and causing damaging destructions that may end deadly. The final stage is called,"" decay stage,"" this is when the tornado finally weakens slowly start to diminish"" (Reynolds 136).
Thunderstorms that cause cool-dry air, which can be unstable, then causing the winds to shift creating an updraft funnel to spin faster thus a tornado is now in pursuit. A tornado can be identified as, ""a violently rotating column of air that is in contract with the ground"" (Douglas 2007). Seen in Fig. A, it shows the formation on how tornadoes begin out as a wall cloud that is low hanging in the air. Then when cool and warm updrafts meet they cause circulation, or a vortex, creating a funnel cloud, thus is the structure of a tornado.
Fig. A.
One important aspect of tornadoes is the supercell or wind duration. Supercells are the main cause of rotation to develop a tornado. ""These cells are the most violent of all storms causing mass amount of rain, lightning strikes and large amounts of hail to be produced in the updrafts""(Dunlop 83).
Each tornado is determined by the Fujita Scale, ""meaning the damage and microburst from the downdrafts of the storm"" (Douglas 2007). The ranges of the intensity of this microburst are from EF-0 to EF-5. Seen in Fig. B, The change in the numbers adds up to the wind speed and the amount of possible damages.
F-0
65-85 mph
The breakage of tree branches and signboards
F-1
86-110 mph
Roof uplifts and moving vehicles to be blown off the road
F-2
111-135 mph
Mobile home demolishment and boxcar overturned
F-3
136-165 mph
Severe damages to roofs and small walls to be torn off and trees in forest to be uplifted and thrown
F-4
166-200 mph
Devastating damages to homes to be completely ripped apart and cars to be thrown some distance
F-5-""The hand of god,""
+200 mph
Everything in it path is left looking like a war zone; nothing is left standing
(Fig. B, Fujita Scale Keller 256)
The heavy winds that gain speed throughout the circulation going clockwise, is the main cause to the destruction to properties, crops and other validities. Debris is a large amount of the injuries and deaths per year. However as seen through the Fujita Scale, debris is increased with the velocity it picks up. The winds are a huge cause in the production, but imagine large scrap metal flying at you 100 mph fatalities is likely in this path.
The current use of technology used for locating and determining strong severe storms are: Doppler Radar system, the Doppler on Wheels and weather balloons, probes, remote controlled planes, sirens and hailstone samples. The most recognizable although is the Doppler Radar found on local weather channels relying the ten day forecast. The Doppler Radar is commonly used for monitoring and predicts the weather for public safety or just weekday weather forecasts. "" Antennas send out electromagnetic radiation that has a wavelength. clouds, raindrops, ice particles reflect these electromagnetic waves back to a receiving antennas"" (Keller 2008). They are generally located on the top of radio satellite towers in the majority of every county, but not all of them. They have the ability of only reading about a hundred mile radiuses for detecting on coming weather.
Watches and warnings are put on using the Doppler Radar systems to locate the potential developments of storms in the region. They keep people up to date on the intensity of the progressing storms and to send out signals for the sirens when a destructive or life threatening storm has upraised. Watches are identified as, "" possibility of a tornado or a tornadoes, or developing in the near future"" (Keller 2008). Meteorologist and local television stations keep the public informed by closely monitoring them. Warnings on the other hand are, "" a tornado has actually been sighted or detected by weather radar"" (Keller 2008).
Despite weather is never one hundred percent positive and can change spontaneously at any given time the room for scientific experiments to test the limits of science research like so many times before. Some believe that it will make a difference, such as, Kevin Droegemar a meteorologist from the University of Oklahoma. He believes that the lack of warning times that are false is the cause of the location of the Doppler Radar satellites. ""We have reached our limit.radars are only put in certain locations they are not everywhere. (Lucas). Including the lack of data it can read from a long distance, right now it is only about a hundred miles. That range is not very far so in a way the National Weather service have guess a large range of possible severe storms developing and the high area with the degree change is the one chosen. The Doppler is the best use of detector, but the weather is recording is already happening, the satellites are neither fast enough nor accurate. In result it can only giving small amounts of leeway for radar analysts to put out the warning time. ""Tornado prediction remains frustrating unreliable, with the average warning time of only thirteen minutes and a false-alarm rate of around 75 percent"" (Frankel, 2009). Droegemar is currently trying an experimental test involving the lowering of the satellites closer to the ground since tornado happen from the ground up. It is of now that it is a non-cost experience but he hopes to one day have an,"" half hour before they occur (tornadoes). we need to see closer to the ground where we don't really observe, he says. The data he hopes to one-day spot directly when and where a tornado will strike, but as of now even a thunderstorm is hard to predict; unfortunately science hasn't reached that far yet. A colleague of Kevin's, Josh Wurmer, a member of the Center for Severe Weather Research in Boulder, CO and former storm chaser on the Discovery Channel. He believes that ""25% of supercell thunderstorms form tornadoes, but some don't"" (Lucas). So roughly one out of every five supercells have the potential to create a tornado. If Kevin is right with this experimental project it could accurately locate a supercell and possibly increase the warning times to twenty to third minutes instead of twelve to fourteen minutes. The main objection for all meteorologists is to warn the people and he may just be that person to boost that cause.
Every year roughly one thousand of these beautiful, but deadly weather phenomena's take place. As seen in Fig. C, the cold air from the Rockies and the warm air from the Gulf of Mexico is carried up in the central portion of the United States thus overlapping and creating, "" Tornado Alley.""

swiping from Texas up north through the Canadian border. The most well known state is Oklahoma, from a data stating the numbers of tornadoes that hit from 1950 to 1994, Oklahoma ranked second. Texas rated 5,490 tornadoes where Oklahoma had 2,300 tornadoes for the time frame (Douglas 2007). This data demonstrates that although Texas ranked first the most tornadoes within those years, it shows that Oklahoma is still a clearly dangerous state to live within the Tornado Alley. Due to being closer to the Gulf it has the perfect set up for these lines of storms. Even with the current global warming condition it is said to have intensified these storms to produce many at once, even up to twenty in a week.
As a result the technology that is recently being used isn't always accurate, but weather is uncontrollable and can be hard to determine with some of the resources available. People don't understand that science has come a long way with information that we now know that we didn't know back in the nineties. We use what got and go from there, everyday new developments are found so it's only a matter of time for the unbearably hard question has a solution. I'd like to think that every science has a hypothesis and a thesis and by testing them you find your solution, even if you're wrong the first couple of times. Every year tornadoes get stronger and harder to detect, not all tornadoes are created equal in a sense. The Doppler Radar has helped save lives in the past and will do so until newer devices are put to the test. Technology like the weather can always fail or change course so you use your best intuition and try to save as many lives possible, however you can't save everyone. Currently in Lincoln, NE the local university (UNL) has $11. 9 million study to taking place for a five-week trial. Starting in May to June, this will be the first time since aircraft was set from the sea. The study, called Tempest, involves a remote-control plane in which will be set into supercell of the tornado getting readings that have never been recorded. However, due to the risks of damage the aircraft will not be flying directly into the tornado but where as into the stream of air feeding it. ""The goal is to improve tornado forecasting so people have more advanced warnings..fewer false alarms."" The instrument should be capable of reading, ""temperatures, humidity, and pressure. The cost per place up to $25,000 and has the speed of 50 mph"" (Omaha World Herald). The locations on which they planes to take off convently are on the planes of Tornado Alley. These states include: South Dakota, western Iowa, eastern Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.
Even with storms prediction currently not as accurate as many meteorologists wish the new development experiments taking place may one day be the breakthrough in science history. I hope that one day I am one of those people that can help contribute to these public safety causes. Weather that doesn't have a known cause is a beautiful site, but when you imagine the destruction its may have at the end of the tunnel new perspectives arise. That is why I am pro-placement of the Doppler Radar to be close to the ground. It takes just one person to think of an idea and to have a significant outcome.

Is Qin Shi Huang a completely tyrannical emperor or was he also productive? 
P5D2 
April 23, 2015 
Killing scholars and burning books to banish opposing thought, carrying out harsh punishment to guarantee the implementation of law, charging heavy taxes on people to support the building of the Great Wall, palaces and even his tomb (Qian, 145B.C.). Those were atrocities Qin Shi Huang did when he reined over China. Qin Shi Huang is the builder of the Qin Empire in China at 221BC. He is famous for his tyrannical behavior such as the conduction of ""nine family extermination"", which is a kind of punishment toward people who did things that enrage Qin Shi Huang by killing the person and his family, friends and neighbors. The trigger ranged from big political mistake to even a small joke about Qin Shi Huang. ""History experts debate whether Qin Shi Huang was a unifier or a destroyer during his brief reign 2,200 years ago"" Football, 2010). He unified the Chinese territory but sacrificed thousands and thousands people to satisfy and glorify him, which hugely weakened the power of the nation. However, was he a complete despot who did nothing helpful? To appraise Qin Shi Huang objectively, we can not blind our eyes just by the negative side he did as a brutal ruler. It's a fact that he relentlessly oppressed his people. However, some of things he did still brought great welfare to China. 
Firstly, the most obvious beneficial thing Qin Shi Huang did is that he conquered the whole territory. The dynasty before the Qin dynasty-the West Zhou dynasty was a weak centralized regime which had 7 states that were all isolated from the control of the central regime. The old central government was void and acted like a puppy when 7 states warred with each other year by year. Each state wanted to swallow other's land and become the successor. The disorder lasted around 400 years. The winner of this game was the Qin state. Strengthened by internal political revolution, the Qin state stood out and became the most powerful state in this period. Led by Qin Shi Huang, ""Qin destroyed the other six strong states - Han, Zhao, Wei, Yan, Chu and Qi, unified China, and established the first centralized, unified, multi-ethnic feudal state in Chinese history - the Qin Dynasty"" (Warrior tours, 2014). This was by all means a big event in Chinese history. The building of this unified empire marked the beginning of feudalism history in China and left its feudalistic central-power-thought lasted about two thousand years. ""The unification of the Qin State ended the long-term separations and local divisions in China and it made Chinese people live a peaceful and steady life to some extent"" (Warrior tours, 2014). The old country at that time was tired to face any war. It needed a unified country to recover and grow its economy. In this way Qin Shi Huang was a great conqueror. Even though his aggressive invasion toward other states cost numerous death during war, his conquer is necessary and beneficial in this historical period. 
After laying a national foundation for China to buffer and develop, Qin Shi Huang continued to make his economic and cultural revolution. ""The first Qin Emperor standardized the length, measures and weights, and unified the currency, which promoted the economical communications between different ethnic groups, and conveniently provided opportunities for socio-economic development"" (Warrior tours, 2014). This action is so far away from us that we do not feel very strong how influential this policy was. However, for people at that time, this was the most beneficial change that affected their daily life. The territory of China before the Qin Empire was separated. Each state run their own systems and conducted different policies. So every state's currency, measurement of length and weight were almost different. It was a common situation that you show your money to another state's people, but they can not recognize it. The measurement of the same stuff was different among states so they could not communicate about it easily. That caused huge inconvenience for people to trade between states and states and also impeded whole empire's economy. A standard is so important because it dictate each place of the country can interact well and run effectively. Qin Shi Huang conducted his standard of currency and measurement as early as he built the empire. That was a wise decision to run an empire efficiently. 
""Culturally, Qin Shi Huang unified the characters by making the mini-seal scripts as the official ones, which promoted cultural communications"" (Warrior tours, 2014). Before the Qin Empire was built, each state had its ""langrage"". They used their own official scripts and pronunciation. This situation limited the sharing of knowledge and informing of new policy between states. Scholars also had difficulty to study in other states due to the language difference. To eliminate such awkward situation, Qin Shi Huang claimed that only the mini-scripts characters were the official writing form, which he thought is the most beautiful form. Even though the differences of pronunciation between each state still existed, which is an unchangeable fact, the formation of writing made the spread of written publication between different places possible. Due to the feasibility of the standard of Chinese script, this policy largely facilitated the education and economy, eased the delivery and implement of policy and strengthened the control of whole country. 
Zhe Zhang (1527-1602), a famous scholar of Chinese history, evaluated Qin Shi Huang of ""The first emperor"". Qin Shi Huang is the first emperor in Chinese history. He is an instinctive conqueror to build a nation but didn't have too much wise to manage it. All he did in his lifetime was to satisfy his vanity, both the expanding of his territory and building of useless large projects. However, we cannot deny that he is also the first leader to bring so many considerable changes. Even though he trampled his people by force and punishment, conducted revolutions to show his achievements, some of his policies still brought great welfare to China. Qin Shi Huang is a despot, but is also a productive ruler. The contribution he left can compensate some of his fatuity when we see his place in long-term history.

"P5D3 Argumentative Essay 
May 1, 2015. 
India's Modernity - A Question. 
According to Angus Maddison, by 1922, the British held over 458 million people, hence bringing modernity to about one-fifth of the world's population during that time. A lot of debates have gone over whether the British rule in India did actually lead to its modernization and this broad question, can be interpreted in many ways and hence have different answers. Modernity is not only limited to infrastructural development. It can be defined as the enlightenment of ideas such as fraternity, liberty and education. The British rule in India passed along these ideas of modernity to India and also brought about various reforms and infrastructural developments, hence being a catalyst in modernizing the country. 
One of the primary questions that I chose to answer was whether the British Raj in India led to the abolishment of 'Sati,' a ritual in India where widows burned themselves on top of their husband's cremation pyres. I have explained how, by aiding in abolishing the practice of 'Sati,' the British liberated and freed the women of a ritual forcefully imposed on them. There are various arguments regarding the extent of British role in doing so. In her book, Contentious Traditions: The Debate on Sati in Colonial India 1987, Lata Mani talks in great detail about the debate regarding the practice of 'Sati'. The people who were in support of Sati, who generally consisted of the Brahmins and Pundits, gave religious reasons for not abolishing Sati. They stated that there were scriptural sanctions for Sati. On the contrary, the anti-supporters of Sati said that the practice was mentioned in a different manner. They were of the belief that the Pundits and the women's family coerced the women to perform Sati for their own material gains. The British then banned Sati in 1829. 
Mani states that it was actually the colonial officials who started the debate by using their own legislation to prove that 'Sati' violates human rights. However, <name> says that British only helped because a section of Indians were also actively campaigning against the removal of Sati and that it was largely because of the initial efforts of Ram Mohan Roy and his group, 'Brahmo Samaj,' that the British used the legislation to prohibit Sati. However, we can also pose an argument to this fact. In their book A Concise History of Modern India: Third Edition 2012, Barbara and Thomas Metcalf have written that Ram Mohan Roy was educated in the western style education, was adept in English and was also the leader of the Brahmo Samaj. So, we can say that he only raised his voice because of his Western style education, which indirectly states that it was the British who were responsible for the abolishment of Sati. 
In their book A Concise History of Modern India: Third Edition 2012, Barbara and Thomas Metcalf have written that with the views of the British emerged a new middle class called the 'Bhadraloks,' who were also called the colonial middle class. They were generally the ones who flourished under the British rule and could be characterized by their western style education and proficiency in English. These people now started getting involved in the print culture and were announced as the coming of a new 'modern' India. They also spoke about Roy being educated in the same manner, which goes on to prove that the British were indeed indirectly responsible for aiding in abolishing Sati. 
In her interview, <name> said that 'Modernity came to India because of the British rule.' Modernization is not only limited to reforms. The British also brought along with them new kinds of transportation and technology, which the Indians were unaware of. They introduced the concept of railways and also introduced new techniques of irrigation in India. Apart from this, they invested heavily in telegraphy, roads and ports as well. For example, the British started the Great Indian Peninsular Railway and East Indian Railway in 1854. 
Even though what the British did was only for their own personal gains of colonization and never for the well being of the Indians, it's time that the British receive their due credit for bringing modernization to India. They brought about modernity in terms of development, in the way the people of India thought and also brought about a degree of education in India by providing a western style education to the people. Overall, there happens to be a strong belief among Indians that the British only robbed them of all their resources. However, with the arguments presented to you within this paper it is clear that even though they did rob India of all its resources, they also left them with a gift - The gift of modernity!

Online shopping and logistics 
Online shopping is playing a more and more important role in people's daily lives. With the development of online shopping, logistics industry has boosted a lot. The whole process of online shopping needs the cooperation of these two industries. Online shopping not only boosts the logistics industry, but also provides many benefits for people. From my perspective, companies should not build or rent retail stores. It is better for them to improve their online shopping service, and make online shopping replace real malls. 
Online shopping can stimulate the countries' economic development, especially the logistics industry. Firstly, according to a survey1, the total transaction fund in China on 11th November was 5. 75 billion in 2013, but in 2014, it was about 57. 1 billion. These figures clearly show that online shopping increases the volume of logistics industry. Furthermore, online shopping provides people with different diplomas. In this modern city, the competition for graduated students is very severe. Many of them are unemployed, even if they have a very high education level. However, everyone can be an online shop owner with or without a diploma. Only the quality of goods and services provided by online shop owners are concerns of online shoppers. Also, as stated before, with the expansion of logistics industry, the employment has raised a lot. E-commerce and logistics also provide various positions for people with different diplomas. 
The last thing I want to point out is that online shopping has many advantages that real malls do not have. Online shopping makes it easier and more convenient for online shoppers to purchase all kinds of things around the world. By clicking keyboards at home, shoppers can get commodities within few days via delivery companies. Also, online shopping websites always provide reviews from former purchasers, so the shoppers can compare the qualities of goods. Moreover, coupons are given to the old costumers. So the more customers buy on the same website, the more they will save. 
Some people believe that online shopping cannot replace real malls, because they think they may get fake goods. I worried about this before, however, the policies of the online shopping websites make me completely trust the quality of their goods. For example, amazon provides free return and free shipping to costumers. If costumers receive goods that they do not like, they can return it without any fees. Also, all online shop owners must provide their own ID cards and identities to have their shops- they are bounded by laws. Some people also say that in poor areas the economies are not so developed that people there do not have access to the Internet. However, society and technology are changing, network coverage areas are becoming larger. So, I believe in the near future, the economies in the poor areas will be much more developed than today, and people there will all be able to shop online. 
In conclusion, I believe that online shopping will finally take the place of real shopping malls. The land used for shopping malls now will be used for the infrastructure constructions. Although there are defects of my opinions, I think the advantages of online shopping will overshadow the disadvantages, and online shopping will be the mainstream trend.

The SAT as the Predictor of College Success 
	The SAT is an American standardized test founded in 1926 with the purpose of gauging students' performance in college. This test, in present, comprises of the core math and writing section, where students are instructed to answer questions testing their quantitative and verbal ability in a limited time period. The optional SAT II is also available for students intending to focus more on their science and social science mastery. In general, the SAT makes college admissions easier by placing students into spectrums based on their SAT score - this way, colleges are well-informed about a student's academic performance. Despite the SAT being one of the dominant standardized test in the United States and is used pervasively in institutions to gauge students' performance pre-entering college, its flaws, which include its questionable validity and reliability, outweigh its practical benefits to ease college admissions - this can be shown in the rising number of universities in the United States omitting the need for the SAT in its admissions. 
The SAT drives core knowledge away from students. In other words, since the SAT was introduced, the whole purpose of learning, which is to discover and experience knowledge, was slightly taken away. Individually, the SAT might have created a misconception between students about aptitude - it is common to see students with a high SAT score being praised as ""intelligent,"" and this works vice versa to students having a low SAT score. This is also true when it comes to the school itself, where awards or scholarships are given to those who excel in any standardized test. Although it is not wrong to do this, because it bestows a sense of motivation for a student's hard work, this ""endowment"" made students to define success as possessing the best test score, and what I am concerned with are the students who do not excel in the test - they might be demotivated due to having acknowledged of where they are in the ""success spectrum,"" and because of that, they are driven by the made-up boundary; this situation relates to the Emotional Security Theory proposed by psychologist Dr. William E. Blitz, which states a person will build the tenancy to be demotivated after realizing his or her weakness; some symptoms include having a low self-esteem about oneself. Instead of making college admissions easier, the SAT might have flushed numbers of potential candidates who could show their talent on test papers, thus glorifying students with good test taking ability. 
Besides individuals, schools are also affected by the obsession of the standardized test; a school's success, nationally, is defined by a comparable variable between other schools in the United States, which is its students average standardized test score. This causes institutions, at some point, to coerce students to perform well in their tests. Students in these schools will not only feel pressured to learn, but are also likely to be weeded out in the harsh-paced environment - although this might sound as if all schools are racing to be on top of the rankings, but keep in mind that there are awards given tentatively, whether in terms of prizes or funding, for ""successful schools"" that achieved a respectful average test score. Students are not the only ones being pushed - teachers also have to deal with their delegation to meet the school's target, and this cause teachers to ""teach for the test"" instead of exposing students to an intuitive approach of a subject. The SAT itself was structured in a way that students could answer with a rule of thumb, by crossing out the wrong answer, and making a guess in a short time period - these are not intuitive. Because of this, students are taught to learn rigidly on the test, and the lack of intuition will not guarantee a students' success in college because most of its evaluations are not strictly formatted. These causes mentioned earlier, might collectively lead students to spending most of their time studying to prepare for a test, rather than giving more attention to explore knowledge. 
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, American Time Use Survey 
Above is a research conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States. To summarize, high school students generally spend more time studying per day than college students. One leading factor of why this happens is because of the presence of external standardized tests - the SAT and the ACT. Although these graphs do not match in terms of variables used, I roughly modelled an estimation between both graphs' study hours, where high school students spend 32% of their day studying, while college students spend 20% of that. Assumptions, for simplification purpose, are made as follows: students in high school are not employed, college students are studying full-time. In a nutshell, the external test given to students seem to fail in mimicking college life. Studying all the time, in fact, does not ensure good grades in college because students are evaluated based on how well they present, work in a team, research, and many more. 
While the SAT does not reflect a student as a whole, its scores could also be affected by external factors - causing inaccurate ""aptitude"" measurement. ""External factors"" in this context means a candidate's outer conditions before a test that might affect test scores. For example, sickness, stress, and injury. By common sense, a healthy student performs better in a test than an ill student - this is because peoples' motor and thinking ability is tied to their health on a certain day, however an optimal health condition on a fixed test day is not guaranteed. Some students have to deal with unexpected illness while sitting for a test, and what makes it more unfortunate is that the test score is evaluated on just the specific day; college admissions do not care about what happen to a student during a test, what they see is a piece of paper with a test score. This shows that although the SAT was made for a fair assessment between students, the scores might not tell how a student performs optimally - the scores may be ""polluted"" by health factor. The stress and tension caused by the test itself could also affect how a student will do on the test - this can be coined into a term called ""test anxiety,"" a psychological term introduced by Spielberger & Vagg, 1995. According to Spielberger, test anxieties is a common syndrome ingrained in students; there is no way to avoid test anxiety. Test anxiety is similar to stage fright, everybody has it; it is just the matter of how people handle stage fright, and so does test anxiety. The only difference in pre-test stress level among students is how well they manage the syndrome. The test anxiety syndrome, as a matter of fact, disrupts the purpose of a test to be standardized because not all students could handle stress very well. In other words, students' scores are affected by their personal stress, and this could be worsen by outside detrimental factors such as financial problems, childhood trauma, or family conflicts. In addition, test anxiety may also come from tense competition among students, and one who experience this is Kshiraga, a sophomore SAT candidate, who was very involved in the rat race to achieve the ""perfect score."" Her depression was illustrated in a conversation with a health journalist: ""I felt that something I had spent so much time on (the SAT) should be perfect."" (Ksrshirsaga, 3). Kshiraga is one student who volunteered to express her feelings on the SAT, what about the unseen ones? Her case, based on general observation on other SAT candidates, is most likely not personal. In short, test anxiety can be a concealed reason of why SAT scores vary among students. 
Students' schooling condition may also be one of the external factors affecting test scores. In general, students who came from a community whose members care less about education tends to have harder time struggling with the SAT - this is shown in the difference in SAT scores between students in rural and urban areas. Put aside the fact that rural areas have less facilities available - Let's go deeper into the community itself. Students' in urban areas tend to achieve higher scores due to the competition they have among students. Those in rural areas, on the other hand, might not have the competing environment. Below are bar graphs comparing SAT scores among different levels of parental education: 
Source: The Washington Post 
Although the graph above does not distinguish the difference between people living in rural and in urban areas, parental education highly relates to where a community lives. A community living in urban areas possesses higher education than that of rural areas. Culturally, the two communities differ in their perspective on education. To the urban community, education is a criteria for survival and for approval by the community. People in the rural areas, on the other hand, hold on to their traditions and some of them have jobs inherited within a family, which also means that their chance of gaining approval by the community is not affected by education - this is what was meant by ""having less concern on education."" Although having a certain test score is under the choice of the specific student, some students in ""laid back areas"" who wished to achieve higher could not get a better score because they do not gain support, whether financially or emotionally, similar to those in urban areas. At the same time, the SAT is claimed to be fair to all students - but how could it be fair if students are not given equal conditions pre-sitting the test? The scores may vary due to different students' living environment. 
Source: Fair Test, College Board. 
	The bar chart above was taken from a research made by the founder of the test itself, College Board. Based on the information above, a student's test score is directly proportional to his or her affluence. This might happen because affluent students are given the advantage to prepare in a better test prep and environment. Poor financial aided students, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach resources similar to their wealthy counterpart. The SAT test itself is not free per sitting, and this limits the amount of retake these students could make. In general, the purpose of the test to be standardized is also perturbed by financial factors. 
Next, the SAT does not reflect a student holistically. It is true that the SAT was not meant to do so - It is claimed to only complement college admissions. However, most colleges in the United States place the SAT as their priority when it comes to admissions. It is common to see students getting rejected admission because they do not achieve the college's ""average SAT score."" Unlike high school grades, the SAT gauges student based on a single factor, or at most, verbal and mathematical skills. This ignores other important traits such as creativity, motivation and discipline - or to be specific, non-cognitive traits that play significant roles in one's life. Because of this, Universities in the United States started omitting the SAT because they had too much ""good test takers"" that could not solve problems within their expectations. George Washington University, D.C., introduced the ""Test-Optional Policy"" to get its aimed holistic students. Up to present, colleges started to realize that the SAT seem to have very small effects to their college academically - even Scott Jaschik, a higher education journalist, admitted that the ""difference the SAT made are so small as to be trivial."" (Jaschik, 8). The reason why is because students treat the SAT as a typical examination they usually had - a number of students will cram whatever information they have before the examination, and release them during the test. When this happens, it is common that students forgot what they learned before the test. Students tend to forget what they crammed because those information before the test have no important meaning tied to them - they were just for the test. Despite the fact that tests are easily forgettable, colleges still expect students to perform well as they did in their SAT. 
In conclusion, the SAT has its unseen deficiencies in predicting students' performance - and because of this, the American education department should take measure on this for a better future of the education system. Revamping a massive student assessment is crucial because it affects students nationwide and it defines a student's future education, which also means future life. From this research, I not only learn the flaws of the SAT - but also the alternatives to a better education system. The first one, which is also the general conclusion of the research, is to abolish or at least place less weight on the SAT in college admissions. By doing this, students are assessed based on their past schooling experiences, instead of being judged on a score evaluated on a single day. This alternative, however, is under the choice and the jurisdiction of the college itself. Next is a suggestion agreed in an interview with <name> (<position>), which is to provide more space for essays in college applications. This allows students to reflect more about themselves and tell how they could fit into their desired college. Finally, a solution which is brought up by most SAT opponents, is to place more weight on college grades and assignments rather than the SAT. High school grades are proven by William C. Hiss to give a better prediction on students' performance. In his study entitled ""Defining Promise: Optional Standardized Testing Policies in American College and University Admissions."" Hiss found that there are no differences in graduation rate between students who submit their standardized test score (SAT/ACT) and students who do not. This research was made in the same ""test-optional"" college, and the average high school GPA in the school are generally the same. This shows that the core driver in students' academic performance depends on how well a student do their assignments, how disciplined they are, and how well do they apply soft skills.

"ENGL 106-i 
Final Draft 
December 9, 2015 
The Inevitable Truth about the SAT 
The discussion regarding the purpose and effectiveness of the SAT has practically existed as long as the standardized test itself. Students, parents and educators have always had their different opinions when it comes to testing a broad range of high school seniors. While some argue that the SAT does an exemplary job on testing students, others, like myself, argue that the test has more disadvantages than benefits. 
The primary purpose of standardized testing, as its name suggests, is to measure students under the same questions and material. Universities can't rely solely on GPA since it can greatly vary depending the school, country or even grading system. In that case, standardized testing is a great method to compare students that come from different backgrounds and learning environments (<name>), personal communication, October 20, 2015). Based on some famous scholars such as Robert Barro, there are other advantages of the SAT that are worth pointing out. Barro (2001) suggests why universities should keep using the SAT. Although numerous people have argued that the SAT is ineffective for evaluating applicants, studies from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) show that admission test scores strongly predict college grades. On the other hand, for those that believe the SAT is a disadvantage to minorities, test scores have the same predictive power within an ethnic group as they do in the overall population. This is why Robert J. Barro, a professor of economics at Harvard University, states that colleges should keep the SAT since it is a good predictor of grades in college and wages after graduation without being a disadvantage depending on gender or ethnicity. 
Although the SAT has some advantages worth mentioning, there are many more disadvantages that make us doubt about the test and whether some changes should be done. The flaws of the SAT can be separated into three major categories: it doesn't include certain subjects, it is biased against low income families, and it doesn't provide information on who is more intelligent or will be more successful. 
The SAT tests students only in math, reading, and writing sections. It doesn't take into consideration subjects regarding liberal arts or science, which means students that are strong in them aren't able to show what they know. <name>, who are freshman students from <place>, described how they felt they could've scored higher if they were tested on subjects regarding their majors (<name>, personal communication, October 22, 2015). Unlike other famous standardized tests, the SAT doesn't include subjects such as chemistry, which is fundamental for certain careers. 
On the other hand, the SAT is a big disadvantage for low income families. Bob Schaeffer, the director of the National Center for Pair and Open Testing, says ""There is still a strong, direct relationship between family income and test scores"" (Pannoni, 2014). Since the SAT is a test that can be studied for, families with a higher income tend to have tutors and classes for the children in order to increase test scores and stay ahead of the competition. Likewise, families that have low income are not able to afford prep-classes and are at a great disadvantage at getting high SAT scores (Buchmann, 2006). 
On the last category, the SAT is clearly not able to prove who is more intelligent or who will be more successful. It is a test that can be studied for and that does not measure how well students will do in college. Students can become familiar with the test, memorize vocabulary words, and in just a few months they can significantly improve their scores. Just as a student from Haverford School described it, ""The simple fact that a score can be altered through learning certain techniques and becoming familiar with the test exposes its imperfection and gives reason to doubt its overall effectiveness (Antanavicius, 2011)"" Educational institutions around the United States are even beginning to question whether the SAT is actually a good tool to measure students. In fact, the University of California- Berkeley decided to cut the SAT in the admission process because there was no direct correlation between freshman year grades and SAT scores (Chan, 2012). 
After thorough research about the SAT and its contributions, it is clear that standardized testing and specifically the SAT has some benefits worth recognizing. Nonetheless, the amount of disadvantages this test brings far exceeds the amount of advantages it does. The test doesn't include certain subjects, it is a disadvantage for low-income families and it does not show who is smarter or who will be more successful in college. Therefore, potential solutions to this problem would be using subject tests more often or putting more weight on high school transcripts for admission processes.

Only child 
Introduction 
	In China, there is a policy called single child policy-which means each family can have only one child. This policy effectively helps to control the population of China, but solutions that come with one child policy accompany problems. For instance, this policy does not consider how it influences the future mental health of an only-child. I was born in a single child family. My parents were always too busy to take care of me. Plus My diffidence keeps me away from making friends with others. My childhood was consist of loneliness. Some of my behavior such as unwilling to do homework and bad social relationship , was defined as lazy and bad, which later found out is ADHD(Attention deficit hyperactive disorder). People who have ADHD usually have trouble with concentration. Some are unable to focus on the conversation, some can't successfully finish assignments. 
what are the positive and negative effect of growing as an only child? 
	One obvious phenomenon is that, many only-children don't have any company. Once their parents go to work, they become alone. Play by themselves, eat by themselves, do homework by themselves, everything they have to do on their own. They are really lonely during their childhood, but it also develops their independence. After they get into college, they don't have to worry about living. They are able to take care of themselves. However, some special situation is that because the kid is the only child in this family, parents give everything their child want, and do whatever their kid want. Kids are too dependent to do anything individually. In addition, sufficient resources in early lifetime lead to their insufficient wants later. Norman Fenton(1928) cited the general conclusion of single children from Bohannon that most of only child's health were below the average in both physical and psychological, such as selfishness, bad social relationship, and unwillingness to school. All of these situations are so extreme that some of single children have totally different personality and behavior with kids who have sibling. For example, some of them don't like doing homework and always get distracted, or they can't organize their daily life well, and they normally don't attend group activity. 
Does only child have higher risk on developing ADHD? 
	In order to verify the definition of the only child from a statistical view, Norman(1928) made an experiment to study a group of children, which contained single children and children who had sibling. The result was surprisingly contradict to Bohannon's conclusion. Norman(1928) discovered the even there were some distinctions, the greatest distinction was in positive aspect-self-confidence. Data from experiment indicated only children , they usually have a little bit more leadership and unpopularity than others, but the difference is negligible. For negative aspect, only children were a little more likely to be aggressive but a small amount. According to this article, Norman(1928)'s experiment denied some previous research about single children. Compare to children who have sibling, only children have no huge difference with them both physically and psychologically. 
	Another people, Judith Black investigated the only child in America, and the results also proved that growing as a single child is a advantage was actually wrong. Judith pointed out only children's cognition are much better than children from two-child families and singles were not desire to more satisfaction and happiness. All of these results verified there is no negative effect growing as a single child, which means children who have sibling take same risk on developing ADHD. 
conclusion 
	After all of these investigation to only children, personally, family education and environment play a significant role in children's development. According to Judith's article(The only child in America), there are three possible explanations why there were so many people emphasizing the negative part of only children. First was the previous research failed to grasp the advantages of being an only child. Second, during the long period of human history, only children and those who had little siblings had always been put on the first priority to raise and usually inherit the elder generation's wealth and knowledge. Last one is social benefits encouraged people to have sibling, some country may have policy that the more children you have, the better benefits you get. Single children families still face a serious problem that children are easily treated lightly when parents both go to work which make their growing environment pretty bad.

Study abroad or study in your own county 
Studying within one's country or abroad tend to have advantages and dis advantages. People who would like to work within country would be considered firstly, it becomes pertinent for them to choose to study within their country. For those who go abroad, the system may mean that people get a better education since some countries may spend more money on building education system than their own country which means students get an opportunity to experience a better education model. In my view, I prefer study abroad. 
In order to demonstrate my opinion I invite my friend who has experience of studying abroad to do an interview. My questions is why you choose to study abroad. My friend told me there were numerous reasons for his choice to study in China. The motivation to go China might have been the culture. He told me it would be a great chance to experience another kind of culture in another country. With time passing by, he realized much more benefits. His reservation for the Chinese way of life changed as he realized that much of the things in the daily lives become a part of things that people have in their culture. From a resource paper ""I learned a lot more about myself in that one semester than I did in the three and a half years in my home school because of the unique space in which I learned, experienced, and spent exploring another culture"" (Dwyer 2015 p.2). It's clear to prove my friend's words. If students can get a chance to go abroad it would not only be a chance to experience another culture, but also a great opportunity to develop students' characteristics which will impose a deep influence on them. 
During our study life, some students who have been tired of same education model in their country. However study abroad provides a good chance for these students to feel another education system. For instance, in America, a student can free to change your major during first two years when you want to change, which is not allowed to do in China. After I have experienced the American educational system, I think this kind of system would be better for students, as students can choose what they are really interested in to learn. Just like my data resources told us ""87 percent of students said that study abroad influenced subsequent educational experiences."" (Dwyer 2015 p.3) If students can go abroad and get these good influences I think it would be a good resource for students' future development. 
Last but not least, after I have read my paper resources, ""Longer stays mean greater benefits."" (Dwyer 2015 p.3) left a deep impression on me. This paper tells us if a student stays overseas longer, more benefits he will get. Indeed during my interview with my friend, he told me that he has been staying in China for three years. During first one year, he didn't change a lot. However, in second and third year he learned some healthy living habits from his Chinese classmates which would be benefit for his entire life. In fact, there are more than four benefits for students to go abroad. I think the most important thing is that you will change your attitude about things around you and even the opinion the world after you have this experience. Using my own experiences to be example. Before I go abroad, I really hate to do some science lab such as chemistry and physics stuff. I think it's not only hard for me, but also boring and useless. However, when I take chemistry course this semester, I find it's really interesting because I can change sentences on book into real laboratories by myself. After these laboratories, I can understand the chemical equations and solutions more vivid which would be very useful for me to get a good grade. 
With the development of society, students have chance to study abroad. From my opinion, I think it's beneficial for students' all-round development.

Chinese Online Review Existence 
As the internet and online market in Chinese developing and growing rapidly, online reviews become very popular for people to look at before purchasing. However, online reviews have their back draws as well. And the abuse of them is more significant than the advantages they have. So probably Chinese online reviews should not exist anymore. 
Online reviews are important factors for customers to make decisions. They could save customers a lot of time to investigate the items online. But for more time, they mislead customers. As we are talking about online reviews' advantages, we are referring to ""real"" online reviews. However, the fact is that a big proportion of online reviews is fake. Fake reviews usually mislead customers and let them lose trust towards the merchants. According to a research, Taobao, one of the biggest online market in China, has up to 30% fake reviews. Can you imagine that three out of ten reviews customers see are fake? Such a big proportion of online reviews has caused perplexity in customers' life. There are a lot of customers who end with getting the unexpected items. This has destined the online review field should not exist in the future. 
Online reviews also has led to an online labor market, to explicitly write fake reviews for merchants which is not ethical. Some of the merchants hire people to write positive reviews for their shops. Since the review area is a free talking space, anyone can leave their thoughts there. Whether someone has purchased the item, he is able to leave comments underneath. Furthermore, there is no specific laws about online reviews in China. Although the intentional deceiving cannot be defined as illegal, it is still unethical. If the online reviews are not prohibited, more and more unethical actions may be taken and finally lead to illegal actions. 
Sometimes, the online reviews are not fake but they are getting inaccurate or getting too personalized. This could also mislead people's minds. For example, an online review of a restaurant is saying that the fish at the restaurant is too salty. Whether salty or not is different from one to the other, it depends on everyone's preferred flavor. If the reviewer is a lite-preferred person, a lot of people could mislead by his comment and not ordering fish or even not going to that restaurant. As well as hotel reviews, someone with mysophobia could leave a review saying that the hotel is terrible with cleanliness, even though a normal person would say the room is perfect and comfortable. As a result, real reviews can also be found inaccurate for most of the people under specific situations. 
Some people may argue that online reviews should keep going. Because it is more convenient and important for people to look at during the pre-purchasing phase. Online reviews are so practical that show people complete introduction of items through personal point views. Before purchasing items or hanging out, online reviews provide people good suggestions that what to buy or where to go when people have no ideas. 
Merchants would recommend online reviews too. The reason is that the online reviews not only good for customers, but also benefit them as well. Online reviews can help people select the best shop out of hundreds of stores. The reviews help merchants build their fames and help them make more money. 
Although it is true that online reviews benefit people a lot, the advantages they have cannot bury the harms they produce. They are practical only when the reviews are general and accurate. Fake reviews totally ruin the word ""practical"". With fake reviews, people tend to be deceived more than benefited. As long as merchants do not hire labors to write reviews for them, online reviews are good for them to build reputations and be aware of their weakness. However, drastic competitions among shops make them no longer ethical. Unfair competitions always happen, with ambitions and fake reviews. Can customers accept that merchants are making money by cheating them? Since the online reviews have led so many problems in Chinese online market, it is not necessary for them to exist any more. People will surely find another way that is beneficial and fair for the market.

"On May 31, 2009, the American doctor, Georg Tiller, was gunned down in Wichita Kansas. Dr. Tiller is a controversial person because he provides public abortion, especially partial birth abortion to women. His clinic was often surrounded by large-scale protest organized by Anti-abortion organizations. It was supposed that his death was relevant to the dispute of abortion. As a matter of fact, the dispute of abortion has never stopped in American history. People who hold liberalism views approve the rational of abortion. While the social conservative believe that abortion is equal to murder.
In the colonial period of Northern America, abortion before quickening is allowed according to the common law of British and America. In that time, abortion was only a moral and not a legal problem. Until the early 19th century, no state established definite law for prohibiting abortion (Balter). However, in 1894, 20 states define abortion before quickening as a minor crime, while abortion after quickening is regarded as second degree murder. Only abortion which is operated to save the life of woman is allowed (Fox News par.1). In 1910, every state except Kansas rules that abortion is illegal, the right of abortion is controlled by doctors even if the abortion is allowed in particular circumstance (George). People who oppose abortion hold a conservative view. They also believe that the limited medical condition of abortion endanger women's health.
The situation changed in the 1950s. With the development of women's liberation movement, people concentrated their attention on the body autonomy of women. Feminists advocate to abolishing the law for prohibiting abortion, they consider that if a woman can't control her body, she will not get the same social statue of men's. With the spread of the idea that women's rights should be equal to men's rights, common people begin to switch their view of abortion, and the behavior of abortion was accepted by the society gradually.
In 1969, a woman called Roe launched a lawsuit against the criminal justice of Dallas, Henry Wade. Roe claimed that she suffered from pregnancy caused by rape and she needed to abort, however, the law of Texas prohibited abortion except the one which can save the lives of women. What's worse is, she didn't have enough money to go to the state where abortion is legal and then get legal abortion. In view of the situation, she had to continue the unexpected pregnancy. Roe believed that a woman has the right to decide when and how to terminate the pregnancy no matter why the woman chooses to abort. The law of Texas disobeyed the federal constitution because it deprived her option. The defendant claimed that the action that deprives the fetus's life without legal procedure was prohibited by the 14th amendment. This case was appealed to the supreme court of United State. In 1973, the court judged that the law for prohibiting abortion of Texas restricted women's option and it infringed on the right of the individual to be free which was protected by the 14th amendment. Because of Roe's appeal, The American government enacted a proposed law called Roe v. Wade in 1973. The law indicated that federal court empowered women the right of abortion (Wikipedia, Roe v. Wade). The Roe v. Wade case is a landmark which protects women's right of abortion. It causes strong disagreement in the society. Since then, the fight for legalizing abortion was becoming increasingly strong.
Even though the appeal of legalizing abortion is accepted by society, the pro-life people who oppose abortion insist on their views. The main idea they hold is that abortion is equal to murder and they believe life begins at conception and fetus is a person in nature. No civilized society gives women the right to take other's life, and thus, the behavior of abortion is equal to killing an innocent person. Furthermore, the medical technology of abortion is not skilled enough to ensure the women's lives. An unsafe abortion can bring about gynecological inflammation, and sometimes it even causes death (Lowen).
It is a truth that fetus is alive. When the egg and sperm join together and creates a fertilized egg, the origin of a new human life begins. And the fertilized egg possesses all DNA essential to contribute the embryo growing into an independent human being. However, it is not a support that fetus is a person in nature, it is a potential person. Since the mother must convey the fetus nutrition and oxygen to help it grow, the fetus cannot live independent of the mother (Elroy). What's more is, the unborn fetus has no ability to perform the social obligation, thus it has no right to enjoy the right. The famous American moral philosopher and metaphysician, Judith Jarvis Thomson, who is an abortion supporter, has an argument about the relationship between the fetus and mother. He declares that the fetus is dependent on the woman for life-sustaining aid, but fetus has no right to get the aid, if the cost of this aid is too high and women can't bear it, they can choose to terminate this aid. If a fetus is a threat to cause harm and death to the woman who is carrying it, the woman can choose abortion as self-defense (Timothy). His argument denies to treating fetus as an independent person. Now that fetus cannot be regarded as a person in nature, abortion is not a behavior of murdering.
According to research, the reasons for abortion are complex, such as the unexpected pregnancy, pregnancy caused by rape, diseases of the fetus and mother (Lawrencen). Table 1 shows the main reasons for abortion, and we can see that most of the reasons are reasonable. Table 1 ( Lawrencen 112)
If a woman gets an unexpected pregnancy, but she has no adequate economic resources to raise up a baby, she will choose to terminate a pregnancy rather than give birth to the baby. If a woman suffers from rape and gets pregnancy, she will not give birth to the unexpected baby. If the fetus is diagnosed as fetal anomaly or the mother has some terrible diseases that will pass to the fetus, the woman will choose to abort to avoid the birth of the unfortunate baby. Just images what will happen if abortion is illegal. All the fetuses are forced to be born. The unexpected baby will be abandoned, and the unfortunate baby must suffer from the pain of diseases. These children's right of enjoying the life has already been deprived when they were forced to be born.
In spite of the fetus' right, we should take women's right into account. Anyone should have the right to control his body, and women are no exception. Forbidding abortion deprives women's autonomous right. As the feminist sense has been around, more and more professional women appear, they focus on their career. If abortion is illegal, it not only makes their lives inconvenient, but also compels them to give up the right of controlling their own bodies. Especially, for some single women and divorced women who get pregnancy, forbidding abortion puts severe pressure on them. Since society does not manage men's bodies in such a manner, forbidding abortion is a discriminate against female. Making abortion legal will give women the real right to control their bodies, and women can get the equal status with man finally.
To sum up the argument above, there is no reason to forbid abortion based on the fetus' right and woman's right. The other view pro-life people hold is that abortion will endanger women's lives, the study had shown that abortion can cause complication and sometimes it even lead to death to women. However, the safety factor of abortion has improved under the modern medical conditions, and protecting women's health cannot be the reason of forbidding abortion.
According to the data of the World Health Organization, about 42 million cases of abortion occur every year, among which 20 million abortion are carried out without adept skill. What's worse is, about 68,000 women die because of unsafe abortion every year, and two million to seven million women suffer from the long-term harm of unsafe abortion. (Wikipedia, par) It is no doubt that unsafe abortion contributes to a large degree in the death of women. As is shown by statistics, nearly 97 percent of unsafe abortions appear in developing countries (David). The table below indicates that the incidence of unsafe abortion in developing countries is higher than the one in developed countries in 2000. Because of the controversy of abortion, there is no general law for abortion in the world, and different countries have different laws for abortion. A study claims that 78% of countries which are located in more developed regions have laws allowing abortion, while only 19% of countries which are located in less developed regions have laws allowing abortion (Marcel). All of the data above suggests that unsafe abortion occur more frequently in developing and less developed regions where abortion is illegal or restrictive, and the legal abortion is difficult to access. Why does this phenomenon exist? Let's take a look at the example of Nigeria first.
Nigeria is one of the developing countries which have restrictive laws for abortion, the government formulates that a women can get legal abortion only if the abortion can save her life. Thus, many women who want to terminate pregnancy turn to clandestine, unsafe abortions for help. The Federal Ministry of Health and other sources claim that ""unsafe abortion accounts for 20-40% of maternal mortality in Nigeria"" (Friday 194). The official data suggests that incidence of maternal mortality rose in the 1990s, and it maintained an increasing trend (Friday). The same situation occurs in Latin American countries where abortion is legally restrictive.
Restrictive laws cannot reduce the abortion rate, and it drives the abortion unsafe. A study shows that about forty percent women live in the regions where abortion is illegal or difficult to access to abortion clinics (Antonio). Their lives are endangered by the restrictive law. I believe that when abortion is legal and performed safely, not only women's health is guaranteed, but also their right to control their bodies is finally respected.
However, the damage of abortion cannot be refuted even if it can be made safely and legally. There are two main methods of abortion. One of the methods is the surgical method, and the other method is medical abortion. Both methods can leave complications to women, such as excessive bleeding, pelvic infection, uterine perforation and cervical tears (Corbett). Sometimes incomplete abortion even drives the women to abort successively which makes the women sterility after abortion. These short-time diseases may be curable, but the long-term effects of abortion are even more serious. It has been proved that abortion increases the risk of getting breast cancer. The terminal of pregnancy generally makes a big loss of the level of estrogen in the body of women. This drop causes the cells in the breast tissue growing rapidly and superabundant of the cells are the incentive of breast cancer. The United State National Cancer Institute claims that a woman has a 50% probability of getting breast cancer at the age of 45 if she had abortion when she was young (Sarah). The other long-term effect is sexual dysfunction. A recent study indicates that 24% of American women show that they suffer from sexual dysfunction and they believe it is caused by the past abortion (Coleman 3). In spite of the physical illness, abortion also leads to mental problems to women. One study of women who have abortion shows that 42% of them feel major depressed, 39% of them get anxiety disorder, and 27% of them have suicidal trend because of the stress caused by post abortion (Coleman). SUD stands for the substance used to measure disorder, the other study shows that it appears more generally in women who had an abortion (Natalie). The damages of abortion on women are really appalling. To protect themselves, women should avoid the abortion.
Abortion is a disputable issue which not only be related to women's right and women's health, it but also can be associated with social issue sometimes, for example, there exists a phenomenon called sex-selective abortion in China. Women will decide to abort because of strong son preference. A study shows that about over 100 million 'missing' females appeared in the world, of which 40 million appeared due to sex-selective abortion in China, sex-selection abortion is the incentive of severe imbalance in the sex ratio (Jin-Bao Nie). It is no doubt that it is a sexual discrimination against female and this action is immoral. This kind of abortion should be avoided to maintain normal order in society.
It is no wonder that abortion has bad effects on women's bodies, and it even does great harm to social stability. However, making abortion illegal is not the solution. To the contrary, making abortion illegal flies in the face of women's right to control their bodies, and it drives the abortion into unsafe situation which endangers women's health. According to the survey, over three million unintended pregnancies occur every year. Making access of birth control easier will avoid hundreds of thousands of abortion. However, millions of Americans don't get access to the methods of birth control or do not know how to use them (Five ways). To avoid abortion, women should learn how to protect themselves, using condoms or taking other scientific contraception measures when they have sex with the partners. The government should propagandize birth control to unmarried women and provide free service of birth control to married women. The clinic Planned parenthood which processes safe medical abortion service to women also provides free birth control to their patients after abortion. At the same time, the clinic tries its best to advertise the method to prevent abortion.
Making abortion legal, more safe abortion will be provided to women, women's right to control their bodies is respected and women's health is safeguarded. Making birth control easier to access to, and more abortion is prevented. Georg Tiller will not be the only person who dies from the dispute of abortion. The way of legalizing abortion is hard but worthy.

"Religious Veils in France
France's population has the highest percentage of Muslims in Europe. Islamic religion is considered the second religion that predominates in France. Muslim people has their communities and do their religious activities every day. Islamic religion has a rule that provides Muslim female should cover their bodies because what they believed. Muslim people called this clothe that cover the body for many names. The most popular names are Niqab and Hijab; these names are depending on situation by how it looks like and how it covers the body. First, Hijab is originally Arabic word that means covering. It is a cloth that wraps around female neck which includes the hair and cover the rest of the body (BBC, 2010). A lot of Islamic scholars agree that Quran mentioned Hijab directly. There are verses in the holy book provides the veil such as, ""O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient"" (Qur'an 33:59), (BBC, 2010, Para 8). This verse is from the holy book but, it translated to English. So, the most of scholars agreed that this verse provides that Muslim females to cover the body which called Hijab. Second, Niqab is like Hijab but, it is different with covering the face. Because, Niqab covers the face except the eyes and area around the eyes. Most of Muslim scholars disagree with Niqab, because, the scholars who think Niqab is not required are considered Niqab just for Prophet Muhammad's wives. However, there are some of scholars agree Niqab for Muslim females as well. So, Hijab and Niqab might have different perspectives of Muslim people, but, all of Muslim scholars considered Islamic veil or specifically Hijab and Niqab is required in Islam. The picture down explain the differences between Islamic veils and has the same purpose which is covering the body.
Figure 1 these are some religious veils and how they look like. BBC, news
Although, Muslim females wear religious veil as active faith, French government considered religious veil which Hijab cover the body and Niqab cover body and the face as well which threat public in France and even against history of France. Because of that, on June 22, 2009, president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy has decided to ban religious veil in Public services, (Britton .D, 2011). French parliament has enacted a new law that any women wear religious veil cannot utilize any public services. For example, women how wear religious veils cannot get any public services which are transportation, public parks and even enter any French department. But, on July 13, 2010, French government has decided to ban the full cover religious veil in any public spaces by the vote 246 to1 of French parliament, (Britton, 2011). French government is one of countries that does not believe religion, because, they think that freedom should not be following a religion. However, Muslim people are angry about the new law which is banning the religious veil, because, the new law that has enact in France is totally against Muslims rights and even the human rights. As a result, there are some women arrested in public because they were wearing the religious veil.
Figure 2 a Muslim women wear Niqab were arrested by the police. Mail news
France government has a long history of secularism, because, France government is considered secularism one of the most important thing for freedom. Secularism means no religion that is required for people. In the past, Most of people in France are debating to separate the religion from the country. They do not want any religion that might bother their freedom. As a result, on February, 1795, the French government provides to ban any wearing that guide to any kind of religion and separated the Church and from the French country, (Britton, 2011). However, freedom is very important for all people over the world to choose any thing which includes religions. Muslim people are free to choose Islamic religion and what the religion provides. Hijab and Niqab or headscarf is faith that Muslim people believed in their dally habit. According to Human Rights organization, ""International human rights law obliges state authorities to avoid coercion in matters of religious freedom"" (Human rights, 2004, Para 3). On other word, it is part of personal freedom to believe roles of the religion that they have chosen. Muslim female have the right to wear any cloth that they want because, French government wants their country free and the people as well.
In addition, since French government banned any wearing guide to religion in 1795, Muslim females were enabled to wear the religious veils in public from 2000 until 2010. For illustration, 2000 is the time when the Muslim population increase in France, (Tisso, 2011). 2010 is the time the religious veils banned in France. So, between 2000 to 2010 Muslim females abled to wear religious veil in public without any notice from the police. Why did the French government ban the religious after allowing them for such long time? Even though France has been secular since 1795, this rule was only introduced 2010.
French government are using gender equality to justify their perspective. They think that it is important part to complete the human rights. Gender equality means each gender has the power to wear anything and having the same opportunity for men and women in public. French government think religious veil for females is not freedom because males do not cover by religious veils. This is good point for French government but, Muslim does not accept it. Muslim agrees that each gender has the power of doing anything and even wearing religious veils. Muslim females do not force to wear, but, it is something they believed. No one was forcing them. They want to wear the religious veil that decided by them self. Also, the new law is force them to wear thing that they do not like it and this is against the gender equality. Also, France government should not consider gender equality a good reason to ban religious veil in France. In fact, gender equality work in different way. For example, having the same opportunity of job in country is considered by gender equality which are women and men. Also, gender equality is very important for education which is having equal opportunity for men and women. So, the point is that banning religious veils is taking away a right of Muslim females not giving a right and gender equality work with other things which is equal education and equal opportunity of jobs for women and men. They are not giving the women the power to choose for themselves.
Public security is considered the most essential reason that justifies French government's perspective about the religious veil. In fact, French government has the rights to protect the public security. French government ban religious veil in public because, they think religious veil is dangerous. According to BBC news, ""a ban in public places such as schools, hospitals and law courts could be justified for security reasons, to combat fraud and to meet the needs of some services"" (BBC news, 2012, Para 7). So, Niqab and Hijab is considered by French government a cloth that covers the identity of the women who wear veils which will cause the danger in society. Because, there some criminals who used religious veil for bad purposes such as stealing money. For example, with stolen credit card the criminals can wear a veil than go to any ATM to get the money without knowing the identification. Also, terrorists use religious veil for bad purpose such as killing people which happened in Afghanistan. They put a pump around their body and explode in any public places just to kill people. However, Muslim people are considered the public security is important. But, that does not mean take their rights or their freedom. They have been in France for long time. The police notice a few people who use religious veil for bad purpose. On other word, if the government is going to ban a public service because of something bad happen in this public serves, the all public services will banned. For example, driving is appropriate technology to save time. But, the whole world notice the bad effects of car accident. Every year and even every month people die because of car accident. So, should France government ban driving cars because of car accident? Similarly, there a few crimes happened via the religious veil. Then, the French government banned the religious veil in public. As a result, public security is important for French government and is important for Muslim people as well, but, it does not mean taking the Muslim right which is religious veil.
Islamic veil is not dangerous in public spaces. In France, there are a lot of Muslim have been long time there. The French government noticed a few problems with religious veil. Also, there are some clothes that sometimes cover the identity. For example, Heavy cloth never be a big problem in French public and never in the French parliament. They do not ban the heavy cloth which sometimes cover the identity because cold winter, there is no limit of clothing in the winter. It is considered like the veil because the heavy clothes in winter cover the identity However, the French government never ban the heavy cloth in the winter that might cause the public dangers by covering the identity.
So, there is simple solution to solve the covered identity in public places, ""Only places of public service would be affected by the ban and only if the identification of the person in those places was deemed necessary'' (Human Rights, 2004). The French government can enact a new law that provides women who wear religious veil uncover their faces in any enters of any places of public serves. For instance, Saudi Arabia is Islamic country that has enacted a law by Islamic religion which women should were religious veils in public. Saudi Arabia has a law that women should uncover their faces in any public serves such as banks and airports. This law is acceptable for people in Saudi Arabia and even Muslim people over the world, because, they believe uncovering faces in any public access is very necessary for the identity and public security. Since covering their faces can be a problem for security, Muslim women can be asked to uncover their faces.
Wearing the veil is not just a tradition, it is important active faith for Muslim women Muslim females wear Hijab and Niqab for role in Islamic religion and they believed. The purpose of wearing veils is hiding between men and women, (Abu-Rabia, 2006). Muslim females wear the veil for just one reason which is their active faith. However, French government think Islamic veil just a tradition that if they banned, they will leave it easily. But, this is wrong, because, ""For many Muslims, wearing a headscarf is not only about religious expression, it is about religious obligation"" (Human rights, 2004). As a result, it is something they believed and worship god by the religious veil.
Since president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, said religious veil are not welcome in France, the French parliament start justify his perspective by a few reasons which are not justifiable and are not acceptable for Muslim people human rights in France. All Muslim people in France agreed that France has a long history of secularism which derived from freedom, but, freedom provides that people are free to choose their religion and even their cloth. Clothes are very simple right that people can have in free country. France government has the right to protect the public from dangerous activity, but, religious veil is not dangerous and it does not mean taking a human right away. The French police do not have a large number of crimes that happened via the religious veil. The only easy solution is uncovering the faces when it is a problem for security in public. Muslim females like to wear religious veil because it is faith in their religion. Therefore, for the best interest of gender equality and religious freedom, France needs to lift its ban on the Muslim veils. At the end, if the French government want the freedom for their country and for their people, they will lift the ban from the public.
