"With more importance being attach to health, people begin to search for different ways to stay healthy. Of course the stress from people's daily life is more and more. So, the number of people who smoke is increasing. But, there is a problem wheather Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, it is needed. First, smoking causes many deaths of lung cancers. Second hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also bad examples fro teens and young adults shows that is okay to smoke. Smoking should be banned in restaurant. Then, regardless if there is a Non smoking section and a smoking section, this does nothing. The smoke still spreads throughout the restaurant. Some people are sensitive to cigarette smoke. Also smoking just doesn't cause damage to others peoples health but it is smelly. People who are non smokers do not want to smell like smoke. So, this action must be acted. A non-smoking person should be able to sit down in a restaurant and not inhale unhealthful smoke while they eat. If they want to smoke they can go outside or if the restaurant is smart enough they would create a whole new room separate from NON smokers. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",CHN
"I agree that. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because two reasons. First, we must study except for academic things, too. After graduation, many of them will be pushed for time as a true member of society. But it's very hard to take part in a society without arrangements. So I think we should have a part-time job as arrangements of a member of society. There are many important things which we can study only through the working. And we must know how money is precious. If we live by only parent's income, and get allowances, we can't realize real value. However we understand its value in mind, it's nonsense. Seeing is believing. We can realize it precious only own experience. Second, I think we should do something while we are college students because for many students campus life is final time which they can use freely. For example traveling abroad, to learn how to drive, however they are very expensive. So we need a lot of money. But its true value rise when we carry out from preparation of money to practice on our own. I think we can spend time efficiently this series of flow by having a part-time job. 4 years is too short to waste.",JPN
"I agree about being non-smoking. Because smoking in restaurants, you will save money without the smell of cigarettes can eat rice. Or because other people do not eat rice, delicious. If smoking and health, learn to make money. Liking the lungs, smoking, and I hate cigarettes tobacco smoke, so I do not like it. I do not understand people smoking in the dining room. Their bodies are harmful cigarettes are to die early. Our family does not like to smoke. So I do not like cigarettes. We all do not like it. Ever since I was little, we have been smoking prevention education. Tobacco is harmful, so we know we should quit smoking and all of us. If you live long enough to quit smoking and his face skin getting better. And tobacco should not lose it. Smoking is Unsportsmanlike. Tobacco smoke, cold smoke in the dining room does not have to breathe. So, not smoked a cigarette in a restaurant. Must be an unconditional non-smoking restaurant. Non-smoking and live longer because of the good and the body better. I may keep my body is. I think this supports my thinking is absolutely right, thanks I love you so much.",KOR
"I agree. Having a part-time job is an important experience for college students which will give them valuable skills and help prepare them for entering the workforce after graduation. First, students seeking part-time employment will get acquainted with the process of gaining employment: finding job openings, filling out a job application, and interviewing. Looking for work usually involves searching online, scanning classified ads in a newspaper, asking friends and relatives, or visiting businesses directly and asking if they are hiring. If the student is interested, he or she needs to fill out a job application and arrange an interview. Interviewing for a job is an important skill as it's a necessary step for every job they will apply for later in their lives. At the job interview the applicant should try to make a good impression. He or she needs to look professional, be courteous, and answer questions in a thoughtful and positive manner. Second, if students are hired they will need to deal with the responsibilities (and stress) that goes along with a job: learning new skills, performing job duties, getting along with their boss and co-workers, interacting with customers, and coordinating their work and study schedules. Juggling part-time work and school can also teach students valuable time management skills. Lastly, students can acquire job skills and earn money. Most jobs will involve the chance to get some training and learn some news skills, whether it's waiting on customers at a restaurant, handling money as a cashier, or selling shoes in a department store. Any money earned can be used towards paying rent, bills, tuition, or for savings. In conclusion, it's clear that college students with part-time jobs learn important skills and will be better prepared for the job market after graduation.",ENS
"I agree the opinion, because almost students will get a job after graduating college. When they enter a company, they experience many things that they won't have done. There is big difference between company and college. That time, if they experience part time job, they will get accustom to the company earlier than not experience. Through having a part time job, students can get much know-how in the case of business which the students can't study at their college. And we can get the chances that we make friends with people who don't have common points in their daily life. For many students who don't have a job, their social is college. They can make friends only through class or circle. But through part time job, we can make friends except college students and professor easily. Of course, the most important thing for college students is studying. It is nonsense to being crazy for the part time job too much and lazing studying. It is necessary to get balance between studying and working. But college time is important for young people. It is mottainai that students spend their time only to studying! I think young people should experience many things positively. Getting a part time job is one of the choices students can choose. Of course students can select another choice, for example circle-activity, volunteer, getting license etc Those are important and meaningful, but we can't get money through those things. A part time job is a valuable choice killing three birds with one stone for us that we can get money, experiment, and friends.",JPN
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons to agree with this idea. One is that part-time job is good experiences for college students. Second is that money is important to do what college students want to do. Firstly, I will explain why part-time job is good experiences for college students. They can learn many things by having a part-time job. For example, I work as a tutor. I learn how important it is to communicate with others, to greet each other, how hard it is to teach something and to get money. I think that what I learn from a part-time job is very useful in my life. If college students don't have a part-time job, they can't realize how hard it is to work, until they have real job. Therefore they worry about their jobs and they might quit their jobs. Secondly, I will explain why money is important to do what college students want to do. In this world, we need money to do something. By the way, how can college students get money, if they don't have a part-time job? Maybe, their families give them money, but they are not children yet, so they should get money to do something by themselves. For example, I want to enter a graduate school, so I need much money to enter. Therefore I have a part-time job and work very hard to save money. That's why I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"I really agree with this topic. All restaurants could ban that bad behavior from the people who smoke in the area of the restaurant. The laws for ban smoker should be more strong to control them. There are many solutions we can do such as make a free space for them to smoke outside the restaurant where can avoid the bad pollution from smoking come in to a restaurant and it can help children from seeing all bad doings from adults. The government should be the first hand to solve this problem by ads on television or radio. They must coordinate with all organizations who try to protest this behavior. Using campaign to convince them from smoking in the restaurants, make the laws available in all areas and give them a harder punishment or stronger fine. Show them for negative of smoking to themselves and their family and may be more useful if they had a family already because they would care to their wife and their baby more than themselves. Policemen could manage this problem clearly and make it available in all area that there are people smoke in the restaurant. They could be fine or punish them by laws and everyone should help together to solve the problem by our hands.",THA
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are reasons. First, through a part-time job we can know things that we need in society. To do it makes me know how to come in contact with people, who are higher position than me, the way to speak correct words and store's management and so on. And to do it makes us develop. For example, if you have a part-time job in restaurants you may be able to learn a way to cooking deliciously and if you have a part-time job in stores that buys many trendy clothes you may be able to learn a way to fold clothes beautifully. Some people who don't experience it, when they get a job, may be very nervous, not find what to do and be useless at all. Secondly, to have a part-time job helps us come true our dreams and what we want to do. I belong to ice hockey club. Playing ice hockey costs much money to buy some protectors and pay club cost. To continue belonging to ice hockey club we must have a part-time job. And people who want to be musician could have to have also a part-time job to buy very expensive guitar. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"Having been employed with a part-time job myself while at college, I truly believe that it is an awesome idea for students to have part-time jobs before they graduate from college, if they have the time to do so. Students who learn responsibility, have nothing to lose and everything to gain by having a job. I know that a student who can keep a part-time job while studying, will gain excellent first-hand experience that cannot always be gained form a college campus. These days, if you are looking for part-time jobs online, you will find many of them are targeting students, partly because the positions are part-time only and partly because students provide cheap labour. The employer wins and the student wins too. Usually, students with experience on their resume are more readily employable because they can show that they have already proven that they can handle a job while balancing college as well. If students are finding it difficult to get a paying job that fits in with their schedule, then they might consider doing volunteer work. There is always plenty of that going around and future employers will still take that into consideration when reviewing job resumes and keep the student in mind.",ENS
"Nowadays, many people like to smoking. Even in the pubic, they also smoke. But in my eyes, that is a terrible thing and smoking should be strongly forbidden in the public. For smokers, smoking only can let them feel a bit relaxed in a short time. In the back of relaxness, so much bad influence are spreading in their body. The most widespread disease of smokers is lung cancer. Many smokers'lung like a black stone when examined. It has losed its pimary function to transport oxygen gas. So smokers are easily sudden died. A thing threatening one's life must should be forbidden. For the people around a smoker, many researches show that they are injured worse. It commomly be defined as Secondhand Smoke. It is unfair to them. They don't do anything, but they bear more harm. If those innocent people are you and you friends, can you tolerate it?For helping the innocent people, please smoker can quit smoking. For nature, smoking can discharge a lot of poisonous gas. It can damage the ozonosphere and lower the air quality. If we all like to smoke, the world must be totally destroyed. After that time, we would be regret about what we ever did. Now the world has many crisises. Of them, smoking plays a important role and cann't be ignore. Through smoking can result so mach terrible consequence, it should need to forbidden all over the world. In the near furture, all people hope to see a new world without cigarette. we everyone need do our best to realize our common dream.",CHN
"In our modern society, all too often we observe that a large number of people get into the habit of smoking at the restaurant; some of them are even students. And whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country? The answer varies greatly. Some people suppose, in some cases, it's very necessary and unavoidable to smoke at a restaurant, especially among business men when they do business. And many people think that smoking can also make people feel refreshed and relaxed after a long day at work. So they want to smoke when they are eating their meals in the restaurants. However, most people believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. One of the most common reasons is that smoking does harm to the health of both the smokers and nonsmokers, worst of all, it may cause the cancer and heart disease. And an individual who smokes a lot may not be popular among people around him just because of the unpleasant smell from his body. I am personally in favor of the ban of the smoking. Because it not only benefit our physical capacity but also save us a large amount of money.",CHN
"I feel strongly that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Much as I empathize with smokers, the act of smoking concerns affects not just the smoker but also those around him. Taking into account that restaurants are public places with patrons from different walks of life and different age groups, smoking should be banned. Firstly, the act of smoking produces toxic gases which are detrimental to health. Research has shown that people do die from second-hand smoking, that is, inhaling the smoke of cigarettes though they themselves are non-smokers. In addition, it may cause discomfort to others who may not like the smell of cigarette smoke. These negative influences that smoking has on the health of others support my stand that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. In Singapore, non-smoking areas and smoking areas are clearly marked out to cater to smokers and non-smokers. However, such an effort is insufficient as smoke may eventually still go over to the non-smoking areas. The best solution would be to ban smoking entirely at dining areas. Besides the health effects of smoking, there may be other consequences too. Restaurants serve food to its customers, and the ash from the cigarette smoke may contaminate the food. Food hygiene could thus be potentially compromised. Nevertheless, I do understand that it is tempting for smokers to have a cigarette after a meal. They could always excuse themselves from the restaurant and smoke elsewhere. There is no need to allow smoking in restaurants to cater to their needs at the expense of other non-smokers. In all, smoking should be banned in all restaurants due to the unpleasant effects it brings to non-smokers. The welfare of non-smokers should not be compromised for the convenience of smokers. ",SIN
"As we all know, smoking is bad for our health. So some people choose not to smoke. But sometimes even non-smokers are forced to smoke. Yes, that is second hand smoking. So in my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because restaurant is a public place. Most people are for the ban. So am I, and I think it a wise choice. Smoking will do harm to smoker's lungs and cause many diseases such as heart attack and even lung cancer. What's worse, passive smoking may cause worse effects. So smoking in public places is irresponsible to both smokers and people around. For each other's health concerns, smoking should be banned in restaurants. Though most people agree with it, when it comes to exercise, some people still act negatively. Some think it as unpractical because smoking people occupies most of the customers and it is equally important to protect smokers' freedom. But I think starting it from now on is wiser because it makes no sense to leave it alone until the problem become much worse. The government should try to set some regulations that all the restaurant ban people from smoking inside of the restaurant. If they really want to smoke, they can go outside of the restaurant to smoke and it won't influence others.",CHN
"Students in university sometimes have a part-time job, they do this because of certain motives; they want to get a money to pay their tuition, just for fun because they don't like to study, or do part-time because of influence from their friends. Partâ€“time job certainly affects the students' performance in the class by making them cannot concentrate in the class, sleepy, and tired. Most of students do part-time job because they want to get extra money to pay for their expenses in university. As a consequence, they spend more time to work, means, less time to study. In addition, part-time job usually requires students to work physically. Human body is not a robot, it has a limit, so, after a day of part-time, they will feel tired and use the time in class to sleep, even if they are not sleeping in class, they will follow the subject painfully. As a result, they get nothing from the class. It is good if students can control themselves to do the part-time. But, usually when deal with money, students will sacrifice more time to get more money. So, I think it is not good to have part-time job while studying in university. For the financial problem, it is better to ask for financial help from university, so students can concentrate more in their study, and have a better future.",HKG
"I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, a restaurant is a place where people can eat dishes and feel comfortable. Although some smokers may feel relaxed when they smoke, other people don't feel so when there is a thick smoke at a restaurant. If smokers want to smoke, they should smoke at smoking area or their home. Secondly, smoking affects not only smokers themselves but also other people. At a restaurant, there are many people from children to the elderly people. Even if people don't smoke, and are in good health, second-hand smoke is very harmful to them. This is because second-hand smoke is worse than smoke which smokers breathe directly from tobacco. And we can't protect ourselves from smoke in the air when we eat dishes and talk at a restaurant. It's terrible thing to be ill because of second-hand smoke. Lastly, a restaurant is one of public places. So every people should consider about other people each other. It is an important manner to stop smoking in public places. Although it should be hard for smokers, they need to recognize how smoking damages other people's health. By these reasons, I support the idea that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country.",JPN

"Smoking is a common activity for adults and teenagers. For adults, smoking is a past-time even if they know what could happen to them. Today, teenagers smoke because it is the trend. They think that if they don't smoke, they won't be cool or would get left out. Based on my experience, some smokers that I know learned smoking from their friends because they were pressured to do it. And as time passed by, they got used to it and got addicted more and more each day they smoked. Another reason why teenagers smoke is curiosity. Since we are young we tend to try new things. Because of our curiosity, we try smoking even without knowing what could happen to us. Some get influenced by family, advertisements and especially by the media Restaurant is a place for people to eat and socialize. They go to restaurants to satisfy themselves with food when they're hungry. It is really dangerous for people to smoke in restaurants because of health risks to every people who might inhale the smoke. It can affect the food that we are eating. The smoke might give bacteria to the food and drinks we intake that might cause sickness to every people and also destroy the good environment that the restaurant is located to. I believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants because for me it should have a right place to smoke not in a restaurant. I personally hate smoking especially in restaurants I don't feel well when I inhale smokes. It's really not good to the health of every people. In a restaurant different people are inside of it adults, teenagers, toddlers and I personally have care for them.

"I agree to great extent that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. As there is non-smoker using the same vicinity together with the smokers, everyone should be mindful on their shared spaces so that there is no disturbance causes to the people around. Smoking in places such as restaurants could pollute the air quality, which could causes uncomfortable experience to other users nearby. For instance, the effect of smoking restaurant which are mainly air-conditioned space, it would tap the exhaust smoke from the smokers within the restaurant which give off unpleasant smells. This could affect those people who could possibility find it uncomfortable to be in a restaurants that fills with the smell of smoking. Nonetheless, it creates unhappiness of non-smokers about the restaurant's environment and the dining experience will be greatly affected. There had been measures taken to manage this issues by the government, as they activity encourage smokers to smoke only at designated areas of the coffee shop or shopping malls. Therefore, this effort helps to reducing the contact between non-smokers and smokers. Hence, it has creates a better air quality within shops and public spaces. However, it might have causes difficulties to smokers to smoke freely in anywhere they would wanted. In conclusion, we have to strive for a balance society whereby smoker and non-smokers could harmoniously enjoy the use of common space such as restaurants. By providing specific venue for smoking and encourage understanding from smokers to accept the changes, thus it would build better air quality in our restaurants. ",SIN

"I agree that college students do a part-time job. This is because I teach junior high school students as a tutor now.

A part-time job is sui table because it forces them to know society rules. By the way, some people say that college students should not do a part-time job but a club activity. But I think that only a part-time job has something that we cannot learn from a cl ub activity. For example, obeying a vertical relationship is more severely required in socie ty. Also, they earn money by themselves and will learn its importance. The best way is that they actually experience. This is why a part-time job gives more useful things than a club a ctivity.

"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons as follows. On the one hand, smoking itself does harm to people's health. The harmful substance which comes from cigarettes is not only bad for the smoker himself but also for the people around the smoker. A survey indicates that the person who smokes a lot has a higher risk of getting lung cancer which huge amounts of people die of every year. Besides the smoker, the people around the smoker also take in the poisonous gas into their lungs. So their health is threatened. On the other hand, restaurant is a public place. Everyone should take other's feeling into consideration. If someone smokes in a restaurant, the others will be affected. Because the smoke destroys the environment, it will probably affect other's appetite. Everyone is a part of the society, so it's our duty to think for others.

"In my opinion, I think that having a part-time job is essential for college students. It provides them several advantages. For one, it will give them something to be busy about. College students are to be considered as adults already for they are expected to be mature enough to know how to use their time wisely. Instead of using their leisure time for senseless things, having a part-time job will make them more productive and more skilful. Since college students are just one step away from having a work or job already, it will be beneficial to them if they will have even a little overview as to how it is like in the real world. They will be exposed to the kind of environment that they might be in once they actually start working. They will be more aware to the right kind of attitudes and behaviors that must be practiced in their respective working area. The experience that they will gain in having a part-time job will give them an edge over the others for they may include it in their resume when they will be applying for a job in the near future.

As we all know, smoking has a lot of bad effect on us. I think it is necessary to ban smoking in restaurants. Here are my reasons. Firstly, the smell of cigarettes is offensive, which turns people's stomach. Restaurant is the place where people have meals. The offensive smell fills the restaurant, which affect people's appetite. All of us want to have meals in good and clean surroundings, so it is necessary to drive the smell of cigarettes out of restaurants. This happens only if smoking is banned in restaurants. Secondly, restaurant is a public place. People of all ages, from babies to the old, get into the restaurants. The cigarettes have a harmful effect on people's health, especially pregnant women, babies and the old. If someone smokes in the restaurant, all of people in the restaurants are forced to have passive smoking. Passive smoking has more disadvantages than active smoking.

To sum up, as smoking in restaurants does harm to all of people there, the government should ban smoking in restaurants. Therefore, we can have a nice and clean surroundings to enjoy our meals.",CHN

"Smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants across the country. There is not a single benefit from the habit that justifies the continuation of an act which endangers not just the smoker's health but also the people physically in close proximity. Smoking has been a social habit since the 18th century, and has undergone several evolutions before being marketed globally and becoming a lucrative business. Smoking is the number one cause for the high rates of lung cancers and other smoke related diseases. Nothing strange about that, if one looks closely at the components of a cigarette. Nicotine, tartar and other harmful chemicals are all packed into this little package which promises a momentary physical ""paradise"" for its users, and require frequent use if users want to relive this comfortable state. Most people are addicted to it not purely by choice, but by a physical addiction, which is triggered by psychological responses to the withdrawal symptoms if one attempts to quit smoking. People around smokers get what we call ""second hand smoke"", which researchers say are at least as dangerous as the ""first hand smoke"" smokers get. Thus, we can see the extended damage that smoking can cause. Smoking is a common tool of social bonding between smokers, which is not to be neglected since smokers form a considerable part of society. Given its large industry, tobacco and cigarette manufacturers are formidable establishments which can be detrimental to economies if they are to be closed down. These are the significant reasons why smoking still exists. We have seen why smoking still persists, even if obvious reasons justify their elimination. Still, advocates against smoking are commonly supported, and smoking is continually being eradicated across the world. Other than restaurants, other places are starting to ban smoking entirely, and this is a good first move towards a cleaner world for all. ",SIN
"According to the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, I do not personally agree with it. As a student, your primary job role is to study hard and get good results, this is what your parents send you to school for. However, if the students tends to get a part-time job, they might be distracted by the short term monetary benefits and therefore neglecting their studies and hence, their results plunged rocket down. Also, many students tends to learn rebellious while being in college and giving them a part time job, letting them think that they are young adults might make things worse as they will have the mindset that they are mature enough to handle what adults can handle and do wrong things they will make them regret for life. Some may also think that they can work the part time job for life and neglecting their studies is no big deal for them since they already have a job and they will not starve. Sadly, little do they know that the wages is barely enough to feed their future family if they tend to get married and have kids of their own. ",SIN

"There is merit to the opinion that college students should have part-time jobs. However it is important not to overlook the main purpose of a college education. The main purpose is for them to sharpen their skills for the job market and put as much focus as possible on learning about their chosen field. In many cases of higher education; such as law, medicine and engineering the in-class time is supplemented by internships which are related to coursework. In this case, a large number of hours are required for lab experiments or casework. This makes it virtually impossible to consider any type of part-time job. Those who try to balance a job and a heavy course load, often do it to the detriment of their grades and their physical health. Everyone knows it is difficult to work and study at the same time. This applies to young people as well as adults. If young people must have extracurricular activities, it should be related to their studies or club or community activities. What's more, picking up a few healthy habits, such as devoting enough time to exercising and recreational activities, is something that college life should be all about. This will improve their resumes and give them a well-rounded lifestyle before they are introduced to the tedious working world.",ENS

Then now most of jobs reguire people's experience in the past and when we had part time job such as teacher, computer programmer or even presenter we will easily do the job. Which we have already done in the past. That is the reason why many factories decide to accept people who had a lot of experience rather than people who had good grade in their certificate. Now we are students but in the future we will become a leader at least in our family. When we are students It is proper if we still depend on our parents in financial but when we graduated, our duty is to take care of our own financial by getting a job.

"Cigarette is one of the largest income of Indonesia. Cigarettes can give millions of employment opportunities, so can reduce unemployment. However, smoking has a bad impact. Smoking can cause health problems, heart attack, pneumonia, until death. The impact is also felt by smokers who inhale smoke passively. That is why the restaurant should not allow their customer to smoke. Visitors who smoke in the room can disturb the comfort of other customers. Besides that, the other customers will receive the bad impact of cigarette smoke. Although the effects may not be felt now, these effects are real and many people had experienced it. A good restaurant should be able to ensure the customer's comfort and health. Restaurants can stick to a ban sign for smoking at some point in the room. In addition, the waiters can be warned with polite for visitors to not smoke in the room. Many restaurants are already doing that as a standard of quality in the restaurant. Some of them also provide a special room for customers who smoke. The room is usually an open space, or room with cigarette smoke suction device so that the smoker is also convenient. By providing these rooms, restaurants can ensure the convenience of both parties, visitors who smoke and other visitors.",IDN
"I agree with the opinion that taking a smoke should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, taking a smoke is bad for the health and cigarettes harm not only those that usually smoke but also surround people near the smokers. Such people are more likely to suffer from many kinds of disease than those that are never smoking. Statistics show that smokers are likely to die of cancer. Secondary, those that have ever smoked tend to depend on taking a smoke. These people are not able to stop smoking if they want to stop taking a smoke. This sort of people is also highly likely to be tormented by many sorts of illness and die of various kinds of sickness. Thirdly, it costs smokers much money to take a smoke. Moreover cigarettes are very expensive. However cigarettes are a kind of dependence-producing drug, so smokers can not help buying them because they could not live one moment without taking a smoke. Finally, when someone takes a smoke, those that are having something to eat are likely to hurt their feelings. For this reason, I would say that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",JPN

Many engage in part-time jobs to ""make end meets"". allowing them to earn some pocket-money to indulge in the more extravagant sides of life. However, for a college students, it is important for them to get a part-time job not only to gain experience in life but also to prepare for their out-of-school life in the coming months. Taking up a part-time job is no longer child's play, for their own personal satisfaction. The purpose of schooling is to equip the younger generations with the necessary skills before they join the workforce. College students are at the end of their studying journey and should be thoroughly prepared once they step into the workforce, and to do so, it would be important for them to get a part-time job to learn things outside of the textbook. By getting a part-time job, they get a more in-depth understanding of the nature of the job and not just the theories they learn in classes. Many young graduates hop from industries to industries due to the lack of concrete knowledge and experience in the field. Hence, it would be useful if college students engage in part-time jobs which they presumed they were interested in, to minimise the time they take to find the right job. ",SIN

Although I do not have any experience about part-time job, I agree the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, I think a part-time job can help college students experience the social life early. It is not long since students became the adult. So they need to have more experiences for their psychological maturity. A part-time job can be the best experience that helps students adjusts the real world. Second, I think a part-time job can improve student's independence. In Korea, many college students get an allowance form their parents. However, this can be not helpful to both students and parents. Students try to read their parents' mind because parents cover all the expenses that include tuition and allowances. And parents also have a burden because of money. Having a part-time job can be the best solution. And part-time job also help them improve independence. In conclusion, I think a part-time job is important and necessary to college students because of experiencing social life and improving independence. Actually I also do not experience a part-time job. In this winter vacation, I plan to have a part-time job for improving my independence.",KOR
"I think it should be banned in public places like restaurants because it causes more than 1000 deaths of lung cancers. Second hand smoke affects pregnant women, children and elderly people more. Smoking is also setting bad examples from teens and young adults. Also, scientists agree that smoking is dangerous. Tobacco smoke can cause cancer, strokes and heart disease. Smoking does not just harm the smoker. It also harms people nearby, who breathe in the smoke called passive smoking. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. People should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. Passive smokers do choose to breathe in other people's smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public.",KOR
"Applying the Utilitarian perspective, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. This is because there is overall harm if smoking is not prohibited. Smoking produces a foul smell that some people dislike. Consumers will not wish to dine in an environment that is uncomfortable. Furthermore, not only is smoking harmful to the smoker, it causes more damages to the people around them. Second-hand smokers have a higher probability of contracting lung disease. While some may argue that this is only likely if the person is exposed to second-hand smoke for a long period of time, if smoking is not completely banned, consumers are likely to encounter smokers meal after meal. This will then be detrimental to their health. Consumers include children and elderly and this can cause more damages to them. In addition, if smoking is not banned by law, restaurant owners can face difficulty in declining to offer service to smokers. Consumers may be deterred from entering the restaurant and hence causing the restaurants to suffer losses. These disadvantages of allowing smoking in restaurants outweigh the advantages. If smoking is not completely banned, smokers will be able to exercise freedom in enjoying their puff of smoke. This will be in accordance to the human rights. In conclusion, given that it is more beneficial to ban smoking, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. ",SIN
" Today, many college students take their spare time to do some part-time jobs. In my opinion, part-time job can be allowed, but not necessary. There are many advantages of having a part-time job. For example, Wang, who is my senior school classmate, now is in JiLin university, has ever done a part-time job in a stationer. She is an out-going girl. Her parents are both civil servants, so her family is a rich family. She did the part-time job not for money but for experience. During that time, she was very familiar to each kind of pens and note-books. She knew clearly where they were and how much they were. She showed her patience to each consumer. She deeply experienced that working as an assistant is too difficult. She even knew that earning money is a difficult thing, too. Since then, she began to value each cent. This experience helped her understand too many things that she couldn't get from books or classes. Besides, having a part-time job also can lighten our parents' burden. Maybe we just can earn a little wage, but using the money earned by our own is a wonderful thing. Every coin has two sides. There are also some disadvantages of doing a part-time job. First, if the part-time job takes up your much time, you may have no time to do other things such as doing sports. Then, during our age, the most important thing is to learn knowledge as much as possible. And, doing part-time jobs may cause some security problems. In a word, if we do part-time jobs, we can make progress in a way. But part-time jobs are not necessary, we can do them later, it doesn't matter.",CHN

For example, the students who working while studying will be more mature because doing part-time job is the best way to train and prepare you to be an adult by facing a big problem, managing your own time, and being more responsible.

They maybe are little thing in your life, but someday it might be useful. Working is the best way to bring the knowledge that you have learned for your entire life to use because, nowadays, so many people study at college or university but never know how to use their knowledge. They are just studying for doing an exam and getting degrees. Therefore, college student should have a job to utilize their knowledge. The most important reason that the college students do a part-time job is that they could have their money to spend on what they want without asking permission for their parents. By the way, it is also a great things for their parents too because it is lessen their ex penditure Doing a part-time job has many advantages for students.

"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. For being pre-adults before entering the career society, it is essential for college students to face the music to see how weak their minds and their abilities are. Life at school is far different from that at work. Meanwhile, working part time can make students learn how to manage their time among studies, jobs, entertainments, and other personal stuffs. Also, there will be some income for students who have part-time jobs that can release their parents' economic stress. Students will be able to learn how to manage their money as well, and become independent from their parents' supports gradually. When I was a freshman last year, I worked two part-time jobs. Even though both of them are inside school and were not quite ough, those jobs made me braver and easier to interact with others, and also acknowledge more professors. ""Smile"" and ""patience"" are the most important experience that I learned from my work. I used to expressing my temper out directly, but I changed a lot after I worked for and with so many people. Moreover, as what I mentioned above, my time-management was getting better and efficient. I would finish all my stuff before I went to work so that I would not be too tired to do them when I got back from work. Last but not least, I became not so embarrassed when I asked money from my parents since I paid from my income most of the time, the money required from my parents become fewer, which gave me the best sense of achievement during the working experience.

"In the past, the duty of students mainly is studying. Owing high education level help people find a good job easily. However it is not the case in such a competitive society now. It is important for university students to have a part-time job so as to gain work experience before they enter the community. First of all, studying is totally different from working. Many employers have complained that graduates do not have the right attitude towards work. If graduates take a part-time in their university life, they can learn how to work, including the right attitude and working skills. Participate in part-time job let students know that they are small potatoes inside a firm. They should be obedient and follow strictly the rules of the companies. Otherwise, they will be fired. Besides, social skills are also other important courses. How to cope with or not to annoy others? What you to talk about and what shouldn't? Students can only acquire the above knowledge in the real society by taking a part-time job. More than that, students in Hong King are said to be indulged by parents. Students just ask what they want from their parents. Some universities students take all these for granted. They buy things they like without thinking if it is necessary. Students can be more independent if they can earn and pay by themselves. The money earned by taking a part-time job allows students to do so. Because the money is got through working hard, they are more likely to think twice before they make any decision and treasure things bought by them. To conclude, students who can manage their academic study well should take a part-time job as it can prepare them well before get a full time job after graduate.

If their jobs are tough than they do not take a proper time to their studies, which is very dangerous for them. Jobs are easy and cannot take a lot time of them. In this way they don't take a proper time to their studies.

"From the statement, I think it shouldn't be banned the smoking in all restaurants because there are a lot of people who smoke but the restaurants need a place for smoking, especially it cannot disturb others. For another reason, the restaurants can earn a lot of money from smokers as well as earn from non smokers, so they have to grab both types of customers. Their job is how to keep both of them to still use the service with them. One possible solution that I can notice from many restaurants here already provided special places for smokers such as at the yard, the back of the restaurants, or special rooms. It's very good idea and all smokers and non smokers love that. They can get both of them and all people are satisfied. It's not necessary to ban smoking in all restaurant. The more dangerous of smoking is people do it in public places. This is should be banned rather than in all restaurants.

"I can't agree with this topic. I think we should make some restaurant banned to smoke but not completely. The big reason the way I think to ban in the restaurant is smoking make someone who don't smoke annoy and risk to be lung cancer. If someone smoke in the restaurant, the smog pollutes near things such as wall, table and person include small child. Most of restaurant separate smoking are and non smoking are, but the smoking smell is remain this place. But I think if restaurant banned to smoke completely, walk-smoking person will increase. Because they can't smoke in the restaurant, they become annoy due to the stress. Walk-smoking is many non smoking persons annoy and have dangerous. Because most of primary school students was said that cigarette is makes human harmful, makes human addict and block of tax. recently. And there were some accident which barn some place due to the cigarette and cigarette hit child eye. So there are many persons who dislike walk-smoking. After all I think we should ban walk-smoking before ban restaurant completely. Many place become banned to smoke, so I often see the person who walk-smoking. I think more place banned smoking, more people do walking-smoking. So, I think restaurant shouldn't ban smoking completely before ban walk-smoking.",JPN

"I disagree to the statement. Because for me students should be only be focus on their studies for them to gain knowledge in class discussion. I don't say that a job while studying is not good, but for me, if you can pursue your study even if you are not working then just go to school and study. I also think that being working student is one factor for them to have a hard time completing their stuffs in school like assignments, projects and the knowledge that has to be ready every day before going to school. Finding a job is not that hard if you finish your study should always be first for all the students out there. Well, let's say you have a job while studying, but what is the point of having a job if you are having a hard time in school that causes you to gain low grades? It is useless. My main point in this topic about the importance of part time job to college students is that students should always bear in their mind that education is very important especially it is one of the most-faced problem nowadays of the youth.

Passive smoking, or secondhand smoking, which affects people in the immediate vicinity of smokers, is a major reason for the enforcement of smoking bans. This is a law enforced to stop individuals smoking in indoor public places, such as bars, pubs and restaurants. The idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient, and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces. Critics of bans in the restaurant suggest ventilation is a means of reducing the harmful effects of passive smoking. Many restaurant organizations claim that ventilation systems can bring venues into compliance with smoke free restaurant ordinances. Additionally, restaurant smoking bans may help stop young people from becoming habitual smokers and I therefore fully support this idea.",IDN
"I hold the view that part-time job is not necessary for college students. Above all, taking a part-time job will undoubtedly occupy a lot of time which should be spent on study, leading to a negative effect on our major mission, study. Take my classmate ****** for example. He take a part-time job as a guard out of curiousity. At first, he was fond of it. However, with the increase of classes, he discovered that he had to set aside too much time for the part-time job decreasing his study quality. Now, he wanted to get rid of it. So it is concluded that taking a part time job is bad to our study. However, some of my friends hold the view that it is necessary for college students take part-time job for the reason that it is not only a good way of increasing our income but also good experience. Nevertheless, I disagree with it. First, a college student has to spend 500 RMB per month. Taking a part-time job can only bring 50 RMB per month. It is not worth of spending so much time. Secondly, we should acquire in college is kowledge not work experience. After graduate, we have a lot of time to get work experience and little time to study. It is obvious that it is better to study now and take a job in the future. So, the opinion that part-time job is necessary for college students is wrong. In short, I believe that part-time job is not necessary for college students.",CHN
"For the most part, I would agree. It would help to alleviate a lot of financial burdens that many people are suffering and also boost student's confidence when it comes time to graduate because they would feel better having had some form of work experience under their belts before approaching employers. They would also have picked up some elementary work skills and have a better insight into working full-time by taking these hands on approach. Students need to take care though and ensure that they do not neglect their study or assignments. An organised, common-sense approach will be necessary to keep their time evenly balanced and their study commitments on an even keel. If possible, they should attempt to find work within the sector that they intend working in upon graduation. This will help ease the doors of employment open slightly, more than if they had no experience or were working in a non-relevant field prior to graduation. In addition, I would say that it is also important to keep some sort of social schedule as well. It is very easy to feel overwhelmed and consumed by it all if all the student is doing is working and studying without sufficient'time off'.",ENS
"To spend the life at the university is clearly different from the high school or Mattayom. The very important thing that everybody would think of is the expense at the university. Nowadays, many students have a part time job. I think that it could be important because the expenses in the university's life is very high. Many students are not wealthy themselves, so they might find the way to get money. The part time job could be the first way that they choose. I think for the college students, it should be important because it could help the student to gain more money and it also help their parents about the expenses of family. Some students can earn a lot of money from a part time job. Sometimes it is more than the money that they get from their family. But for the students who are wealthy themselves, it might not be so important because that their money is enough for month. Therefore, the part time job could not be important for them. Most of those student who work for the part time job. I think they could not find any way to gain the money. By the way, the student should be careful when they work because it could disturb their studying skills and the leisure time. finally, I personally think that the part time job is quite necessary to the students because it could help their parents about the expense at the university.",THA
"Have you ever got annoyed by those who smoke when you go into a restaurant? In my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, from most of the medical information which has been indicated in public, we all know that smoking is really bad for health because the cigarette contains many toxic materials which will result in chronic diseases even cancer to people no matter they smoke or not. Secondly, the environment is one of the most important factors which can attract customers to the restaurants. Shouldn't restaurants provide a clean dining environment for their customers? Therefore, it will definitely influence the rights and moods of those who do not smoke to have meals in clean environments if there are people smoking at restaurants. Last but not least, no one can promise the smoke from smoking area will not float to other places in the restaurants even though the restaurants have set up the non-smoking area. Who are going to be responsible to those customers who are under the risk of getting lung cancer? With all the reasons, I strongly suggest that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",TWN
"Smoking was long been a serious topic in the world for many years. Non-smokers hate smoking because it generates a bad smell and makes people feel very uncomfortable. Restaurants are places for people to eat but not smoke, I strongly feel that smoking in restaurants should be banned in any way. To begin, smoking bring a heavy damage to both smokers and non-smokers. Smoking cause serious diseases like lung cancer was proved scientifically in recent years, it affect the health of people. Eating in restaurants is enjoyable, while it creates a bad image for those non-smokers from going to restaurants. Secondly, allowing smoking also has a negative impact to the restaurants. As the number of smokers are far less than the number of non-smokers, smoking in restaurants actually discourage the non-smoking from eat in restaurants. Furthermore, it is not always true that smokers will not go to the restaurants once when smoking is banned because it is not necessary for those smokers smoke in the eating place. The negative impacts for allowing smoking in the restaurants are obvious, but these are unfounded in banning smoking in the restaurants. As a conclude, the government should start moving in order to provide a better eating environment to our citizens.",HKG
"For majority's sake Smoking has undeniably put many to ill and death. Worse, it is not only the smoker but also the innocent second and third-degree inhalers are affected and received unwanted risks. As a result, several countries have completely banned smoking in public areas such as schools, public utility vehicles and even hospitals. Reckoning the number of people being affected, it is the time for the government to consider a total smoking ban in the restaurants in the country. Vulnerability also speaks for it for most of their patrons are families often composed of children of young ages. Not only that harmful smokes and fumes bring threat in their emotional, physiological and physical strength, but also they become susceptible for acquiring that vice, for young ones think that adults ' things are cool and in fashion and that when many does it is right. Also in the business side, it may lessen the restaurant patrons, for they lose the comfort and pleasure of eating. Thus, profit may fall. Yes, smokers are also their clients but they must consider the majority. Who knows, in this quest for saving more lives, the smoker himself/ herself may realized the value of life â€“ his life and the life around him/her.",PHL
"I cheer on that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. I have three reasons to support my opinion. First, as everyone knows that smoking is harmful for people's health. It not only damages smoker's health, but also let smoker's families to have second- hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoke. If in the restaurants, of course, smokers will do harm to non-smokers when they smoke in there. So to protect the customers in the restaurants from being polluted, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. Second, restaurants are the places that people enjoy their meal and have a good family time. It is important to build a comfortable and healthy environment for people to eat in there. Many people feel very unhappy when they sit near to some people who smoke. But they cannot protest because smoking is not banned in the restaurants. They have to suffer and bear. Absolutely, smoking should not be allowed. Last, if smoking be banned at the restaurants, the smokers may know that it is annoying to smoke in the public places. They may change their habits to give up smoking. As a conclusion, smoking should be banned at the restaurants.",CHN
"Nowadays, there are a lot of college students have a part-time job for countless reasons. Someone working to buy the clothes, shoes, or phones while someone working for purchase in daily life or university tuition fees. However, some students do not work a part-time job and they think it is not important. In my opinion, a part-time job is important for college students. One of the reasons that college students should have a part-time job is spending the free time usefully and getting the real experience. Moreover, they can also help their parents for the costs. For example, if they want to buy something they can buy by themselves. Another reason would be wanting to teach them how to be responsible. The final reason that college student should have a part-time job is making friends and learning to live in socially with other people. Of course, some students may think that a part-time job may take time away from studying, hanging out, and doing the homework. They may also think that a part-time job is tiring and boring. I would think that college students could do a part-time job after class or during the summer. In conclusion, I would think that a part-time job for college students is important because it gives them experience, it teaches them how to be responsible, it gives them extra money, and they can make friends by doing the job. Some students may think that a part-time job take away from studying but I think that they could either do a part-time job after class or in the summer.",THA
"I disagree with smoking in restaurants should be allowed because of smoking, the health damage. Danger of smoking causes diseases such as cancer, lung can make people around you smell illegally at a restaurant. I don't hate people that smoke but I don't like to smell it. I can't breath easily. I am very suffering from the smell. After they smoke and they left, many cigarette ash on the table. The next person will get ash on the dish. It's very dangerous and damage health. I am sure many people hate smoking but they don't speak out. I try to find benefit from smoking but I can't find. It may help them to relax, feel good. But I don't do that. In my opinion, it's not good idea to smoke if you have nothing to do. My friends think that it is cool and girl like it. I don't agree with that. If the restaurants allow people to smoke, it can't be restaurants. It should be night club or place to smoke. Food don't delicious and smell so bad. How can I eat that. Smoking should be in their areas, not in the restaurants. I support to ban smoking in all restaurants.",THA
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ??? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned. Not only is smoking any form of tobacco dangerous to you health, but it is also bad for the health of those around you. Smoking should be banned at the restaurants and for all public areas. Smoking negatively affects our society through environmental problems, economic problems, health risks to others, and especially health problems it cause within children. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes and doing so does not benefit anyone in any way. Smoking in public is the same as driving drunk because both endanger the lives of innocent people who choose not to engage in the reckless behavior. The only difference is that with smoking the affects are not visible immediately because it has long term affects. Banning smoking in public will ultimately increase the quality of life and in turn will better society as a whole. At last I agree that completely smoke-free places are the ideal, and some businesses have taken the decision to go completely smoke-free. However, everyone agrees that, it is a matter of rights - the right of smokers to smoke versus non-smokers to protect from passive smoking and to breathe clean air.",THA
"There are many job in our country. In the past, almost people always thought ""All job for adult"". But now, the job aren't limited in adult, students can have a job it's call ""Part- Time Job"". the part-time job is make benefit for many students and it's important for college student to have a part-time job. College student is a person who have 16-20 years old. In this period student can does many work and can get money in free time from study. In the USA, college student must leave out from their home and they must help themselves in everything. Their parents will only support and suggest in their work. When they don't have parents they don't have money too. The part-time job is the best way for them. When they have a part-time job they will have a new experience. They have ability in use the life in social. College student have a part-time job they will have more ability than another. The part-time job give for college student and another person both the money and experience. But in the Thailand, there is very different. When student have 16-20 years old, their parents will suggest to them for only study. Thailand college student must only study and shouldn't think in another topic This reason, Thai students don't have ability in use the life in social because they never do any thing in this period. It's have very disadvantages for them in the future. The part-time job is one way for college student to make a new and have money. The part-time job has a long benefit for students until in the future. So we should support and help with students who want to have a part-time job.",THA
"I don't approve to the idea that the smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country now. The reason is that though the percentage of the people who smoke is becoming low. Most of the people also start understand that smoking is bad to their health and the smoke they breathe out is bad to other people who don't smoke but breathe in that air. As the result, I think it is proper to have some law that limit the right of the smokers is okay, but we can't ban the smoking right totally in the beginning. We should make the goal come true step by step, for the reason that some people is really addict to smoking, it is almost impossible for them to quit smoking. Therefore, some restaurants still have some area for the smokes to smoke. The locations of that smoking area should be settled far from the main area of the restaurants, and the smoking place have to be air floating. Banning the smoking by the law is one way to make people don't smoke, however people don't smoke is because the fear of the government, I don't think let the people be afraid of the government is a good thing. Another way is we can start from the children. By educating the children not to smoke when they become elder. When the future smokers becomes less, the need of the law that banning smoking will no longer exist.",TWN
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, there are several reasons. First, college students have much free time in their daily life, if they spend time on playing games, surfing the Internet for not thing or other meaningless things is so bad. Second, they can learn some skills in many different jobs, at the same time, they may explore the job they really suitable and like in the future. Third, they can make many friends from different background, school, etc. The friendship establishes on work together will be tough and maintain longer than under other situation. Forth, they will find how difficult to earn money by themselves, so that they will cherish things and thank their parents more and more. There are many reasons for college students have a part-time job, but so many parents disagree they do so. Why? Parents worry about they waste time and hurt themselves. Shouldn't protect them in ""warm room"", in fact, it will limit them learn by themselves; let them miss chances to grow. So, I think that college students have a part-time job is useful to their life. Trust them, will mature gradually!",TWN
"Naturally, it is necessary to divide the smoking seat and the no smoking seat at a restaurant. Because I do not smoke, I think all seats no smoking to be good. However, if the smoking rate of Japan takes 25% into consideration, the separation of smoking areas might be the best selection. It is really unpleasant that they smoke in the vicinity though not all the person who doesn't smoke the cigarette feel so. It is unpleasant even to encounter in the town, much less at the table. Moreover, you will have divided the seat though it thinks from smoker's viewpoint. Following the trend of the times, smoking in the shop not separating smoking areas is considerably insensitive. I think that the shop shouldn't make them endure cigarette while they are in the shop. Of course you may be in the inside such a shop. However there are a lot who like smoking with or after eating. It is natural that the shop answers the demand. To tell the truth, there are not so much a lot of stores where the seat is divided in the entire restaurant though in a fast food and a major multiple store the separation of smoking areas is common sense already. The consideration of the shop is certainly a problem. If possible, I think that you should make the no smoking seat. However guest's mind is most importantly. Do not smoke in when the trouble hangs in the person in the next seat.",JPN
" Regardless of the warnings on the cigarette boxes, thousands of smokers buy cigarettes all over the world, which is quite a familiar picture to us. Though most of the smokers know that tobacco is usually connected with lung cancers and other diseases, they still can not get rid of it. This strange phenomenon can owe to the following two reasons. First, people are not fully aware of the harmfulness of smoking. Although we know that smoking can lead to lung diseases, few of us can exactly tell the percentage of lung patient or how many people are killed by cigarette smoking every year. So most smokers would rather to risk their lives than give up smoking. But actually the number of people killed by smokingis about 25 million per year, which I think can frightened many people. The anti-tobacco propaganda is still far from enough. Second, the government depends too much on the taxes of the cigarette companies. It is under the acquiescence of the government that the business of the cigarette companies runs smoothly. And this also explained why no law can be carried out to force people get rid of smoking. The solution to this problem is very hard to be found, because it involves economy, the balance of the society and many other parts. But there still is hope. I hope sincerely that one day in the future that smoking has already become a history and no family suffers from it any more!",CHN
"I agree with the statement. For we have most time to do what we like when we are college students, but if we grow older, we have to work and earn money, so we don't have much time to have a part-time job. And we can experience many varieties of jobs by having a part-time job and we learn how to get along with our colleagues, our boss and the customers or how to get over many problems. So we can grow not only physically but also mentally. But if we don't have a part-time job and don't go through a lot of difficulties, maybe we often don't know what to do or how to get over something when we come to work full-time. And also, many part-time workers cannot earn much money, so we can understand how difficult it is to earn money to live happily and we can realize how important our parents are and we can say Thank you to our parents. And perhaps we hesitate to use a lot of money to enjoy with our friends and enjoy talking with them to save our money instead. So I think it's a necessary step to have a part-time job to college students.",JPN
"Nowadays students of college become more critical and think a lot about their life in future. And they know that the hardest part of adult life is working for money. With a step to go, they will live their life as an adult. And then, why don't they start their work life today? College students aren't same with an employer. They work hard more because living two kinds of profession, student and employer. Many people say that students' job is studying only, there's no need to work for money. Work for money is parents' job. But not every student is lucky enough to have parents with money to pay everything for them. That's a reason why college students need a job, although just a part-time job. It will train them to be a better person. A part-time job teaches how to socialize with others, how to manage money, and how to show a good behavior in front of others. Although they fail in this job, it will cause nothing. They still don't need money as much as an adult. They can find a new way for work. But sometime parents too much worry about their children who have a part-time job. They always have reasons to stop the children's job. I still have enough money for my kids, They will get sick if they still work hard like that, I want they have more concentration on their study, etc. There are many reasons that stop college students for work. Don't worry. It's just a little part of your life, students. Fight over it and you'll find a better future. Keep your hard work.",IDN
"In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants. Firstly, there is no need to argue that smoking is extremely bad for health, which is the main cause for lung cancer and other diseases. The passive smoking is even more harmful and if someone smoke in the restaurant, all the customers will suffer from it. Moreover, if smoking is banned, the restaurant will be under lower risk of fire, especially in the private chartered dining rooms. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurant is a policy which will help in the restaurant management. Without smoke and snipes, the hygiene standard of the restaurant will be improved. Also there will be no more complains about passive smoking from the customers. Lastly, according to research result, smoking while having meals will affect your appetite. In order to enjoy the delicious food in the restaurant, it is better to completely ban smoking. Many smokers feel unfair that the police is not people oriented for them. They argue that they will feel extremely uncomfortable if they cannot find places to smoke sometimes, which I think is quite reasonable. Maybe other than banning smoking completely, common smoking rooms should be set in the restaurants to solve this problem.",HKG
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it provides them with the relevant working experience they would need when they start working in the future. College students would be able to gain working experience and skills which are things that school is unable to teach them. Also, with the lack of experience, students are more likely to engage to part-time job which start from lower levels. I feel that it is essential to start from the lower levels as this allows students to understand what are some of the problems faced as the lower levels when these students move up higher levels in the future. Part-time job allows students to interact with more people of different background and ages, the people that these students usually interact with are probably their family members and their friends. By taking up a part-time job, they get to interact with the supervisor, co-workers as well as customers who probably come from all works of life. Personally, after college, I took up several part time jobs and I interacted with people of different ages and backgrounds. What I learnt was that everyone has a story to share and it is always interesting to learn something new because these people are able to provide you with an additional opinion which you may need when making decisions in the future. Part-time jobs allow students to step out of their comfort zone because there is really much to learn out there. In this modern day and age, many students are definitely more privileged than students in the past and hence they may not be able to be as empathetic. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because there is much to learn. ",SIN
"Today, many restaurants in Japan separate Smoking seat and No-smoking seat, so when we enter restaurant, clerk ask Smoking seat or no-smoking seat? That's show some people, like me hate cigarette's smoking, smell, and so on. However, will this measure of the restaurant be really effective? In many cases, partition between these seats is plastic, glass board etc and smoke cannot be completely intercepted. Besides, air-conditioner carries unpleasant wind to no-smoking seat. With this, Non smoker cannot enjoy themselves enough over meal. Almost all of people know smoking is not good for human body. In addition to this, secondhand smoke is worse than firsthand smoke. What an irrational thing this is! Smoking in the public place will not be an exaggeration to say pollution. For the nonsmoker, if smoke drifts in the store, a special meal is spoiled. We go to restaurant for eating, not to take smoke of others' cigarettes. In Japan, it already tends to exclude smoking. For instance, the regulation that prohibits the walking cigarette is made, and the price hike of the tax is examined. Tobacco is said that There are 100 harms and an advantage none. It is glad that the chance to breathe in the smoke of the cigarette decreases.",JPN
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To have a part-time job not only can make college life more colorful but also help ourselves when we find jobs in future. Besides to join activities and clubs hold by college to cultivate our interest positively, finding a part-time job is also a good way to make friends. Whether being a waiter or waitress in the restaurant or being a tutor to teach little students. Both of them can let us know new friends in different field and increase our social experience. Of course, the biggest advantage is that we can earn money after our hard work. And storing money we can buy what we want, and even go aboard! Though many college students don't have economic problems, I consider that if a college student, who never has a work experience, will be consider being a little strawberry. As if many adults usually think we are unable to stand any difficult things when challenge come! Moreover, because some parents are too spoiled there children and give them too much money to buy luxury item, leading these children don't know that earning money is not easy.

"Some people might hastily say that only attending a university is the easiest and fastest way to live a successful life because a college education is the surest method that guarantees one's success. However, I am convinced that having a part-time job is desirable for college students. Because it can develop your practical skills and experience what is society. To begin with, you can improve your practical skills necessary for a successful career earlier instead of wasting four or more years in college. In Korea, most college students, including soon-to-be graduates, are unfamiliar with practical work skills necessary when they start a job. The reason is that they focus mainly on theoretical knowledge while attending college. Moreover, by having a part-time job, students can save a lot of time and money that can play a role in a person's success. College students have to spend four or more years only studying at school without earning any money. In addition to spending a long time as a student, they have to spend a huge amount of money on expensive tuition and college life, such as taking trips to overseas countries during summer or winter vacations. However, if they have a part-time job they could save enough time and money to become successful. They can save up a certain amount of money each month for stocks and housing investment or work abroad a long time to have various work experiences. In this respect, getting a part-time job seems to be a wise decision for students. In conclusion, for the above reasons. I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",KOR
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, if students have a part-time job, they can know how they work in society. they will have to work when they graduate their colleges. So I think they should have time to prepare for working in society. Second, If they work in various situations, they will learn how they communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate their colleges. So they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become emploees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the most thing they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money. So I think they should work on summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it make their life more valuable thing.",JPN
" Smoking, once considered a shameful thing, however, receives the popularity among the young generation in contemporary society. And it seems to be a culture that the young, especially the students in middle school, smoke extensively. Having their ears pierced, wearing worn-out jeans, with a cigarette hanging between their lips and so on, these young boys (maybe including a few badly-behaved girls )are just trying to change their style, or to look the part of their favorite pop singers or movie stars. They feel smoking makes them look cooler. As we all know, smoking brings about a large amount of disadvantages. First, it does harm to our body health, it can increase the chances of lung disease. Next, those who can't afford buying cigarettes with their pocket money may steal or rob, thus forming awful characters. At length, some of them are so addicted to smoking that they feel uncomfortable when they don't smoke. This will certainly affect their study, in a word, they're ruining their future. On the other hand, the young who smoke heavily are innocent on further reflection. Our society should be responsible for the score-oriented education. The failure to guide the young generation to realize the correct value of life, not only does harm to their health, but discourages their pure soul. They should seriously think about what is truly beautiful and what value we should pursue. However, I do believe, with the efforts of school teachers and the government, the possibility of breathing in fresh air rather than second-hand smoke will come true.",CHN
"I agree with this statement because there are two reasons. Firstly, a cigarette does harm not only smoker, but also people that are around smoker. And secondly, smoke disturbs comfortable eating time. It is said that smoking shortens smokers' life. Person who often smokes is likely to get severe disease, for example cancer, and die in his early age. If someone smokes in official space like a restaurant, smoke of cigarette spreads around smoker, and people around him are also damaged from cigarette. Unfortunately, harm which people around smoker receive is much bigger than harm which smoker receives. Bad smell also spreads during smoking. For smoker smell of cigarette may be good, but it is quite bad for nonsmoker. Smoke makes nonsmoker uncomfortable. At restaurant many people, from children to senior, enjoy eating dishes. They are enjoying both tasting and smelling nice foods. But with smoke, they can't enjoy special eating time perfectly. Smoke prevents nonsmoker from smelling delicious foods. Like this, smoking causes trouble to many customers who don't smoke. So Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoker should smoke in private space, should not smoke in official space where there are many people who don't like smoke.",JPN
"I think this statement is very good for many people. I think we should not smoke at restaurant. Because some people don't like smoke. There are many kinds of people and families with children at restaurant. Smoking make many people get uncomfortable. I think smoke have us don't taste and smell food. It is no means to eat and impolite for cooks. However, some kinds of people want to smoke at any place, only restaurant. They don't have any bad feelings for people who don't smoke. So I would like to both groups have good times. Recently, smoking area separates non-smoking area in many restaurants. But some smoke come non-smoking area. In this way, it is no means to separate. It is admitted to smoke at some restaurants, strong air conditioner should be had in them to remove smoke and change air. So I think we should separate smoking and non-smoking area completely. For example, to make two flours or to build two buildings. But they are very costly and it needs wide ground. It is difficult to realize. It is the easiest way that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. But I want to find better way for both groups.",JPN
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons why I think so. The first reason is that a part-time job tells college students how important money is. It is not until they work that they know how important money is. If they do not have a part-time job, they do not know how important money is and they tend to waste money. The second reason is that college students do not waste their time if they have a part-time job. College students have much free time. But they should use their time meaningfully because they cannot have much free time after graduation. I think they should have a part-time job in order not to waste their precious time. The third reason is that the experience of having a part-time job can be useful when they get a regular job. For example, they learn how to speak with their seniors from a part-time job. If they do not know how to speak with their seniors, they will have difficulties when they get a regular job. And many companies put emphasis on what new employee did in their college life. So people who have a part-time job can be good for getting a regular job. In my opinion, college students should have a part-time job.",JPN
"I agree with the statement that to have a part-time job is important for college students. I have three reasons as following. First, they can study to be a member of society through a part-time job. I think life in college and life in society is very different. When they become a member of society, they are responsible for their job. To take a step to be a member of society, a part-time job is necessary. Second, they can know an importance of money. Most of the college students have been supported by their parents or other people. So, they must have not had a chance to know an importance of money or how difficult earning money is. I don't think all of them have been in such a situation. But, knowing such things is important for all students. All people can't glow up by their own power. Parents or a person who raise children earn money to raise children desperately without using it for themselves. It is very hard. Knowing their pain, we should appreciate what they have done for us. Third, working is hard, but, working is very enjoyable. For example, when we work, we contact with others and they give us thanks or we give a harvest and others praise us. Thus, we can feel challenge, grow up, and get satisfaction. With this, I agree with that statement. Having a part-time job make our life fruitful!!",JPN
"Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions about this question. Some people think it is good to have part-time job. But some other people don't think it is good to do it. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons. Some people are agree with this sentence. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' burden. Besides, it also can increase their chances to practice in society. However, some people object this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste student's time and affect their studying. Therefore, they just need to work hard. As far as I am concerned that students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, without selection, some working that everyone can do will waste our times. And we will learn less. Also it will make working ineffective because of we don't do the job which we should do. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and have some selection.",CHN
"I disagree to the statement given in Topic A. College students have busy schedules that make it difficult for them to maintain a part-time job while pursuing their education. Apart from attending daily lessons, students have to juggle between completing assignments within deadlines and preparing for frequent tests. Having a part-time job will divert students' attention away from school work and reduces the time available for students to revise their work. Furthermore, students working part-time will suffer from fatigue from their work. Since the main priority of students should be focused on excelling in school work, having a part-time job is not important as it could adversely affect the academic performance of students in school. Nevertheless, some may argue that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to become more independent and mature individuals through handling the high levels of stress arising from balancing commitment between the part-time job and studies. However, one should note that college students can learn to be more independent and mature through their school commitments. Many students are actively involved in non-academic work in school that provides opportunities for them to grow as an individual. For instance, many students participate in activities organised by student clubs and societies. This allows students to widen their social circles, manage work-life balance and even assume leadership roles occasionally. Hence, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job given the busy schedules of students and their ability to achieve well-rounded development through other school activities.

"Well, smoking is the popular thing in the world. The majority of people especially the man is smoker. But now not only men but also the woman also is smoker. They enjoy with that because smoking can decrease stress and sleepy. The smoker can smoke everywhere they are, because it is their right as human being who lives in the world usually the smokers smoke after eating and somebody usually eat in the restaurant. So I don't agree if the government ban smoking in restaurant, because usually someone smokes after eating. They can be more enjoy after eating. The government should think how to solve the problem and the idea will not suffer both restaurant and the smoker. So I think the owner of the restaurant should have two areas for the customer who is smoker and not. So the customer can enjoy the food and the restaurant can have many customer. Talking about the disease as the effect of smoking, I think it is just trick for the people who hate smoke and want to damage the smoke industry because the diseases come from many other reasons and causes. Although the person does not smoke but they can get disease so the smoker can smoke everywhere no exception in the restaurant.",IDN
"Part time jobs are mainly observed in western countries although in Pakistan a few percentage of people are found. Part time jobs differs in situation wise. Mainly it is done by poor students who could not afford their academics expenses. part time jobs are performed in different forms i. e by working as a sales man, waiter, cashier or even having tuitions. Such kind of activity although is a source of assistant for their financial crisis but has a negative role regarding their studies, daily routines and even for their health situation. His main focus will be towards his income not paying too much heed towards his studies and health. It has few positive aspects also. It creates a sense of responsibility, a way of support to their finance. If part time job is done in their own field of subject then it will be an extra and practical help to their studies. If some one has the capability to manage his daily routine even doing part time job then its better to do a part time job then remaining free and he secures himself from bad company. The preference depends upon the individual himself. If he wants to do a part time job, he may get some time, otherwise he may want to spend this time with his family or friends.",PAK
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In a restaurant, a gentleman dressed in western-style clothes snags his fingers and asks the waitress, handing several pounds to her. What he said to the waitress? Can you help me buy a pack of cigarette? what described above is a common phenomenon in majority of the restaurants. You may affect by those people when having a dinner with your friends or family. Every customer should have his own right in public. Let alone a restaurant. In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. To begin with, smoking has a bad effect on the people around our both the mental and physical. The mental effect, as we can know smoking is the main cause of the lung cancer. To the smoker, it is a killer. To the people around the smoker, smoking may cause some unexpected changes in their mental ability. Take a little baby for example, if a smoker sits close to a mother with a baby in the restaurant, the baby may cry and shout out. What a unfortunate baby, what's the physical effect? For example when you see a handsome smoking, do you imagine his behavior will be an indication that boy should smoke if they want to be more cool. Several countries have designed laws to ban the smoking in public. This trend indicates people's requirement. All in all we should ban the smoking in the restaurant caring about other people around you.",CHN
"Nowadays, some people take smoking as a method release the stress, but I strongly oppose smoking. There are several reasons presented as follows. First of all, it is in terms of health that smoking is very bad to body at all. In fact, researches nowadays report that cigarettes contain nicotine and tar which is proved badly harmful to human health. According to studies that smoking has higher percent to suffer from lung cancer, laryngo-carcinoma, and oral cavity cancer and so on. What is more, it is not only smokers themselves but also others who don't smoke that would be harmed by cigarettes. That is, experts believe that secondhand smoke do much more damage to people. Besides, they say that a secondhand smoker is smoking six cigarettes while a smoker is smoking only one cigarette. Therefore, stopping smoking is not simply for smokers themselves but also others nearby them. Last but not the least; it is smoking itself that would build a negative appearance of smoker. Most people don't like the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, many people believe that the action of smoking would make them obscene and disliked by others. In a result, we would try our best to prevent people from smoking.",TWN
"Smoking is a practice in which a substance, most commonly tobacco or cannabis, is burned and the smoke is tasted or inhaled. This is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use, as combustion releases the active substances in drugs such as nicotine and makes them available for absorption through the lungs. It can also be done as a part of rituals, to induce trances and spiritual enlightenment smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is today by far the most popular form of smoking and is practiced by over one billion people in the majority of all human societies (citation needed). Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are often not commercially available. The effect of smoking on human health are serious and in many cases, deadly. There are approximately 4000 chemicals in cigarettes hundreds of which are toxic. The ingredients in cigarettes affect everything from the internal functioning of organs to the efficiency of the body's immune system. The effects of cigarette smoking are destructive and widespread",IDN
"As a college student, we have our own responsibilities of life. We have to work for the income ourselves. That is why we need a part time job so much. e have class and need to study most of the times. We can do a full time job. But the problem of living cost still need to be solved. To solve this problem, finding a part time job is a good way. Summer vacation is coming. It is a hot time that many people want to find part time jobs, especially students. Because we students now have more free time to work. Take good use of summer vacation, we can have more extra money to use by get a part time job. Part time jobs have some advantages for us to do. First, it doesn't have to throw all of our time in it. Most of them just need to choose some period that you can go to work. Second, you can learn more new thins and skills, most important of it, and also the ordinary reason we want to get a part time job, is that we can earn some money. However, finding a part time job also has some bad parts. One is that the salary is very little. Sometime the employee may take student as free worker. The paid isn't equal as what we work. The other is that there are plenty of illegal jobs nowadays. If we don't pay pull attention and find jobs carefully, we may break the laws.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is known that smoking is harmful to our bodies. When smokers light the cigarette at the restaurants, not only do they harm themselves, it also affects people around them, who become second hand smokers unknowingly. It is unfair to these non-smokers as they take in second hand smoke which is a lot more toxic than first hand smoke. By banning smoking at all the restaurants, it provides a clean environment for people to dine in. Over time, the country will be well known for their goal to promote a smoke-free milieu, just like how Singapore is known as the ""clean and green country"" and this may boost tourism and investment opportunities and hence, create economic growth. Furthermore, it will increase societal awareness that smoking is detrimental to one's health and hence discourage people from smoking. Over the years, the government has been highlighting the negative effects of smoking, from posting gruesome pictures on the cigarette boxes to advertising in newspapers and on the television. Hence, these strict laws can persuade smokers to have second thoughts before lighting the cigarette and encourage them to quit smoking. ",SIN
"I couldn't agree more. I feel that Japan should issue an immediate smoking ban in all restaurants and also all public places. Contrary to popular opinion on the part of the smoking fraternity, this would in no way violate their civil rights. But rather, it would be protecting the rights of all non-smoking people and the immediate environment as well. Time and time again, we hear of the thousands that die needlessly each year because of smoking related and passive smoking related illnesses or diseases. I think that if adult smokers choose to smoke then of course, that is their prerogative provided that it does not infringe upon the rights and fresh air of non-smokers. I really believe that it is time that Japan played more of a leading role in restricting and regulating smoking areas. Since Japan has a high percentage per capita of heavy smokers, a ban would go a long way towards discouraging smoking in general as well as cleaning up the public space environment so that it is more conducive to the health of all who make use of those spaces. It would seem pointless to spend time and money to reduce harmful pollutants into the air and support global reductions if conversely, Japan was to allow and condone smokers to pollute Japan's own public spaces.",ENS
"Cigarette is a thing that contain a lot of poison. Many opinion said that smoking make the smoker fresh, peaceful and become more patient. Truly, all of that was cause by the poison called nicotine inside them. But, that feeling just happen in a short time period, when are smoking. Nicotine also make the smoker being addicted. If they become addict person, they will smokes every where they are, at car, at home, event at the public place like restaurants, malls, bus, office, bars, etc. Cigarettes not only impact on the main smoker, but also give effect to people around him. In this case, people who were around the smoker are called passive smokers. There are many observations about passive smokers, it is related about is the passive smokers threatened or not. The result is the passive smokers even more threatened than the main smokers. It can be imagine, how big the danger brought on by smoking and what percentage are all around us. For the examples, there are many smokers inside public places such as restaurant. You are inside there too, you can imagine in the place that you should have some healthy food but you also have the smoke from the smokers. You will inhale some of poison and make your body unhealthy. So, the conclusion is smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

Nowadays people who are addicted to smoking are losing ground. Secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. A warning of the danger of smoking is printed on every pack of cigarettes. But Still Many people smoke cigarettes. Why the people smoke cigarettes more and more. Because Cigarettes has a nicotine. Nicotine is highly addictive. Smoking is harmful [injurious] to your health. And don't expose children to secondhand smoke. Because Children has no level of immunity. Also Smoking can increase the risk of developing heart disease. Many American cities and several states have restricted smoking in private and public places. So Korea's government emulates America's policy. Cigarette smoking is responsible for about 90% of deaths from lung cancer. Smoking can seriously damage your health. These days it's tough being a smoker. Because a smoking area is going down more and more. Smoking may reduce blood flow to the discs and cause them to degenerate. Smoking is bad for your health. So Nowadays The number of smokers is on the decrease. But Adults raise their eyebrows at the idea of students' smoking. Smokers often have raised blood pressure. Health is a national power. So I disagree students' smoking. As a result Smokers have higher chance of getting lung cancer than nonsmokers. You can quite Smoke.,KOR
"To completely ban smoking in every restaurants in the country is a na?ve idea since it will be met with many oppositions from the smokers. It may be ideal for the society if this can be achieved but this is most likely agreed to only by non-smokers. As a non-smoker, I agree that smoking by other people causes disturbance as the air feels suffocating with a smoker nearby. However, since smoking is a kind of relaxation activity or even a need for most smoker, I do not think that it is fair to remove the rights for someone to do something if it does not cause direct harm on another. With that said, smokers should be considerate enough to not smoke in enclosed areas since the discomfort on the non-smokers is amplified. The ban of smoking in air conditioned areas is a more feasible and ideal one where smokers are still able to smoke when they are in open areas and non-smokers do not have to worry about the quality of air when they are in enclosed areas. Instead of banning smoking in every restaurant, another more effective way to tackle this issue is perhaps to discourage smoking by organising campaigns to encourage people to quit smoking. ",SIN
"I agree with the statement. There are some reasons. For the first reason, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. They want to play with friends, buy their favorite clothes, and take part in parties. Some people who live alone near the college need also a lot of money to live. To do such things, they need money. Before entering the college, most students were given money by their parents, but some day they must be independent from their parents. So, they must know the difficulty of getting money. Of course, students can't make all money for their life, but I think that they have to get at least enough money to satisfy their desire and help their parents. For the second, they can meet many people to have a part-time job and get different knowledge which they couldn't get ever. There are many kinds of part-time jobs, and there are various people at the working place. Some are from very far place, and others are very older or younger than them. As working with such people, they can learn many things. And the experience of part-time jobs may be useful for them after entering society. For these reasons, I think that college students need to have a part-time job.",JPN
"I strongly believe that students should have the urge to commit themselves on part-time jobs pertaining to those who are at the tertiary level. This is because on our century today, the tuition fees are inevitably increasing. Some parents would have a hard time paying the tuition fees of their children. To lessen the burden our parents are carrying, we must have the guts to help them. Another reason would be for students to gain experience and to develop their strengths and weaknesses. Engaging ourselves on things that we do not usually do can help improve our well-being. One's personality can be changed through socializing. Also, this can help in applying for full-time jobs in the near future. Brought by experience, one can be easily accepted on companies if they already had previous experiences most especially those types that enhance one's skills. Lastly, for some students who do not have anything to work with during their free hours, taking up a part-time job would be the best way to occupy their time with. Instead of engaging ourselves on unnecessary matters, we can help not only to our family and self but also to the own country as well. One can gain extra income for future necessities.",PHL
"When it comes to the importance for college students to have a part time job, no one can deny that having some work experiences is good for our future. As a matter of that having work experiences before graduation is benefits for many aspect, including of learning, broad horizon and the plan for future. As far as I concerned, the main reason why I agree students should have a part-time job can be summarized as following points. First of all, in most of western world, parents usually let their children be independence by earning themselves. However, most of students in Taiwan still rely on their parents in daily life. I think that having a part-time job can let children learn independence without their parents. In the second place, the tired and difficultness of parents is easily to be ignored. Having a part-time job is a good chance to let child learn the importance of money. The will make allowance in good use, thinking twice before spend. Last but most importance is that students can learn how to interact with others from having part-time jobs. The process when they work can be a experience and good lesson in their future life. According the reasons I have mentioned above, I agree that having a part-time job is importance for students' colleges.",TWN
"From my point of view, it's essential for us college students to have part-time jobs. As is shown in some surveys, the percentage of university students doing part-time jobs cam be as high as 70 percent in some schools located in the prosperous district, especially those around the CBD. Alleged to a new survey I have recently read, many students have the desire to do part-time jobs from the bottom of heart. As above, we can see part-time job is fairly important, just as the meaning of water to fishes. Why are part-time jobs so popular in some way? There are some reasons probably explaining the puzzle. Among college students, nearly all are adults. Deep in their heart is a sense of independence, which means to support themselves as possible as they can. This is the most crucial fountain of the motive for us university students to have part-time jobs. Furthermore, it's part-time jobs that improve our comprehensive abilities and add to our social experience. Meanwhile, through social practice just like part-time jobs, not only can we make some extra money to support our daily life and lighten parental load, but widen out horizons and strengthen our relationship webs, which are very precious sources and will assuredly help us someday somewhere. What's more, part-time jobs covering some of our leisure time, we can shorten our time spent on boring things such as popular games, soap operas or chats. Part-time jobs make our life full in some degree. All in all, as college students, as adults, it's time that we went into the real society and did something. Part-time job can serve as a media or bridge for us, so why not seize the time and opportunity. Remember, time is flying, so is opportunity.

A Caucasian diner seated next to me lighted his cigarette and started puffing away. I was completely turned off because my food had subconsciously become poisonous to me.

I believe every diner would like to enjoy the ambience, quality food and excellence service while paying top dollars at a restaurant. However if someone were to smoke in the restaurant, none of us would be able to indulge in that perfect dining experience. In addition, there is no need to discuss further about the negative and harmful impact of smoking on human health.

" At present, it becomes a trend that college students go in for part-time jobs in their spare time. As far as I am concerned, it's important for us to do proper part-time jobs. Entering college means the first time to be really individual to most students. And after all we will sooner or later walk into the real society and face many challenges alone. Definitely, while in college, it's quite a good opportunity to enhance our ability to cope with many difficulties that we probably come across later. For example, how to deal with the interpersonal relationship properly how to face the huge tasks that your boss set and above all how can we be confident. Doing part-time jobs can make us know more about the society and teach us how to be engaged in it. It is the golden time to learn new things at this age, especially this process of learning is like bury the seeds from which we can harvest a lot in four years when we formally enter the society. On the other hand, doing part-time jobs can teach students a very important lesson, namely how to make money and how hard to make money. For a long period, most student may have been accustomed to asking money from their parents. It cannot do any help to shape a correct attitude toward money. Whereas, part-time jobs can solve the problem. Through the work, students know it impressively that No pains, no gains. And they can also enjoy their own gains.

Smoking is harmful to many organs of human being. Smoking often will bring about lots of disease, and shorten our life. As far as I can see, smoking should be completely banned in public places (such as restaurants, classroom and so on) in our country. The city will be more harmonious and more beautiful than ever. Of course, it is a habit hard to give up for those long-time smokers. So some special places which is for smoking must be built in the restaurant. There exists a long history for smoking.

In some places smoking is not allowed, also some municipalities are not allowing people to smoke anywhere they just assign a spot where you can smoke. There are also some establishments that prohibit the smokers. Restaurants should ban the smokers so that the non-smokers won't be bothered. The smoke from the cigarettes are hazardous to our health, smoking is dangerous but second hand smoke is more dangerous so people who will inhale the smoke is more likely to get ill than those who smoke. I agree that smoking should be ban in restaurants, especially those restaurants who have a closed space that doesn't allow the air to go out but just circulate around.

"Smoking is a bad habit, but it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it would also affect others' health, however, if we advocate no smoking in all the restaurants in country, does anybody think of the chain-smokers? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, it's so hard to ask them quit smoking habit in short time. So, if all the restaurants ban the smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen at last? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking place or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking, the action doesn't encourage people to smoke, it just offer some room for smokers to relax temporally. A chain-smoker will be unhappy without smoking, and who wants to see somebody having a long face when enjoying meal at restaurants? In conclusion, setting up smoking places is better than banning smoking at all restaurants, the former may be a better policy and be reciprocal for all the restaurants, costumers and smokers.",TWN
"Almost from the age of comprehension, we have been repeatedly told the negative impacts of smoking by various sources: our parents, our teachers, legislators, health campaigners, surveyors and researchers. (The irony is that none of them are likely to have ever been smokers. ) Yet, despite facing numerous legislative restrictions and taxations in terms of marketing and publicity, the act of smoking in public places (although to be fair, they cannot smoke inside buildings) continues to plague the non-smokers. Why is smoking so popular, and in so many countries? Could it be that non-smokers have been lied to? Joking aside, I feel that smoking should be banned from restaurants. Smoking, or ingesting various gaseous substances thought to be beneficial for our health has been a part of man's history since the stone ages. Religious groups such as the Rastafarians smoke marijuana to enter a trance-like state, which they believe brings them closer to God. In the 1840s, the Chinese addiction to that British import led to the loss of many lives during the Opium Wars. Withdrawal from the addictive substance nicotine found in tobacco often leads to ""cold turkey"" syndrome, in which the person may suffer from fever, shivers and diarrhoea. While smokers are also human and it would be unfair to them to have to smoke in special cubicles, or walk 100meters away from the restaurant just for a smoke, their actions encroach on the comfort of others around them and also affects their health. Perhaps a compromise, such as using a nicotine patch while in the restaurant would be beneficial to both parties without imposing on the rights of either. Nobody ( I doubt even smokers) would like to have the smell of cigarette smoke lingering in the food they are about to consume. ",SIN
"This has already been a welcome introduction in many parts of the USA and I agree one hundred percent with the bans. I strongly suggest that Japan follow suit and stay abreast of modern health concerns. It can only reduce insurance costs and decrease the extremely high risks to people that don't smoke, when they are forced to inhale chemicals that can kill them. I have only been to Japan a few times but every time I come, I frequently dine out and have visited many fine restaurants around Tokyo. While I have noticed that there are smoking and non-smoking sections in many of the up-market restaurants that I have frequented, I don't feel that this is adequate because there is no guarantee whatsoever that a small percentage of cigarette fumes will not drift my way. Despite the best exhaust systems or segregating patrons into smaller glassed in rooms, I still feel uncomfortable and would much prefer it if the Japanese Government just issued smoking bans outright and put a lot of non-smoker's minds at ease. Most countries have legislation and regulations regarding poisonous chemicals and also the disposal of harmful wastes. Cigarette smoke is a harmful waste and needs to be regulated along with all other poisons.",ENS
"Part time job is necessary for all students because it is benefit for them. In summer vocation and winter vocation student waste their time so this is benefit for them that they do part time job. In this way their general knowledge and confidence increases. Student can do many social works also. In this way Pakistan's progress will improve. Although it has advantages some one can meet their financial problems. But students, those have more important to pay need on their studies they spend their extra time in earning and became fully tired after doing they left no time to give time to their studies. And people can't give time to their families which is also very important and right of their family. Although that person is not a machine but he would do every work in balance and also should give time to their children and families because they need their attention more than their money.

"I agree with this statement extremely, because smoking can harm other people who can not smoke. The restaurant is a place to have food, be relaxed, and also get fresh air, so a person who needs to smoke should not go there. I think every country has a rule to stop this behavior, but some people who can not stop smoking could not do it. The restaurant should have the rule about PLEASE DO NOT SMOKE HERE in every corner. Although, there are more people against this rule but it is the rule that every people should strongly do it as normal. The restaurant is a public place where people are willing to go there. If a person who need to have a cigarette he/she should go out of that restaurant and smoke at his/her own house. Smoking is the bad behavior that can cause any problem to the person who smoke and not smoke. Please beware that it is not the medicine to cure your problem when you can not think or do more work at the urgent situation. The smoking people should think a lot how smoking can cause the problem to other person beside you. It might cause other people to dead.",THA
"I agree with the statement. College students are mostly in their 20s and are adults with a social life that requires money, such as going out for dinners or shopping for clothes. Therefore, having an income (even a small one) will be useful for college students in ensuring that their social life is not compromised during the school term. Moreover, having to rely on parents for additional income can be a little embarrassing and may put a strain on their financial resource. Therefore, I feel that it will be better for college students to have their own income. While it can sometimes be tough to manage one's time, especially with assignments and other school commitments, one still has the opportunity to be flexible with his/her part-time job, by taking less shifts or quitting it since there are not obliged to continue in the long term (as a last resort). Part-time jobs that enable flexibility are providing tuition or working on an ad-hoc basis such as modeling or screen-writing. I therefore conclude that it is imperative that college students have a part-time job in order to keep up with their social lifestyles and not burden their parents, some of whom may already be retired.

"Smoking is a life-threatening habit, don't you agree? If it really affects human life, what is the point of still allowing smoking in public places? In light of this, I absolutely agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First of all, a restaurant looks like a closed box. Smoking in such place would definitely cause side effects on health. This is because breathing in second-hand smoke would spark off coughing. More seriously, bronchitis and asthma may also result under prolonged exposure to such smoke. Since health is the most essential element to human, banning smoking at all restaurants can help people to stay away from devil. Secondly, smoking is detrimental to air pollution. In order to tackle this problem, prohibiting smoking at restaurants can eliminate one of the emission sources of smoke. Although it only helps little compared to tens of thousands of smokers all around the street, it at least can remedy the situation by reducing the places available for smokers to emit waste gas. Last but not least, people usually do not enjoy taking in second-hand smoke. Limiting smoking can make the atmosphere in restaurants better as the smelly gas would make the food taste worse psychologically. As a result, the reputation of the restaurant would be ruined. On the contrary, without such smoke, it becomes more enjoyable to eat inside the restaurant and can thus attract more customers. So it is really necessary to ban smoking at all restaurants. In view of above reasons, forbidding smoking would undoubtedly call for prompt action. In absence of smoke, health can be improved, pollution can be relieved and thus customers can enjoy their meals in the restaurants. Therefore, there is no doubt that completely disallowing people to smoke at restaurants is a correct practice.",HKG
"I agree that part time job is important for university students. Not only can we earn some money, but also learn work experience. In the respect of part time job salary, if university students have their own economics ability, they can do more things that they really want to do, such as studying aboard or learning other things that they interested in. They don't have to worry about money and have colorful school life. Another good thing is that they don't have to ask money from their parents. Part time job also offer some social training for students. University students can experience social environment and learn some skill that can not learn in campus. Students can also make friends with various people in different ages and jobs. From these different background people, students can learn a lot including lifestyle, life experience, and social skill and so on. I think it's vital for university students to have a part time job. However, it's necessary to take a balance between part time job and school homework. Although taking a part time job can earn money and get work experience, school homework is also important. Every student who has part time can not forget their duty- Studying. But if students have no idea to spend their free time, taking a part time job is a good choice for them.",TWN
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, taking a part-time job is very popular for college students because it has many advantages for them. There are some reasons for my opinion. First, students have much free time in universities. They should spend their time doing things that are beneficial for them, rather than wasting valuable time playing computer games, sleeping and so on all the time. Taking a part-time job can make their college life more meaningful. Second, they always take money from their parents when they have no money, which result from their bad habits of using money. Now, it is time for them to understand their parents' working-hard supporting the whole family and learn to use money reasonably. At last but not least, college students have learned much theoretical knowledge from textbooks, but they lack practical ability to solve all kinds of problems. So, taking a part-time job is a good chance to practice them and gain useful experience in society. In my opinion, it is very necessary for college students to take a part-time job. If they want to gain success, and then they had battle to make arrangements ahead of time. So, they can take a part-time job, from which improve their ability and accumulate experience.",CHN

"Smoking is an activity that is not useful. This is because if you smoke it will harm themselves and others. Smoking is composed of 2 types of active and passive smokers. Active smokers are people who smoke, passive smokers while the people who do not smoke but inhale cigarette smoke because he is in an environment where there are people who smoke. Secondhand smoke is more dangerous than active smokers. Indonesia is a country with the third-largest cigarette consumption after india and china. Therefore, smoking should be banned, especially if they are in public places like restaurants. As we know most of the restaurants provide a special room for smoking-called smoking area. This is intended to not disturb other visitors who do not like smoking. Usually these areas are ventilated directly connected to the outside so as not to spread and disrupt other. But better still if the room did not exist anymore because in addition to making room in need of money that not a few also in the presence of a smoking ban then the visitors are indirectly forced to not smoke. Should smoking completely banned in all restaurants in Indonesia because the country is very dangerous for smokers and for those who inhale the cigarette smoke. For active smokers can cause cancer, hypertension and others and to continue to inhale secondhand smoke if it is indirectly hoard disease that if allowed to drag on can cause kematian.

"I think it is good for college students to have full time jobs as they can learn on the job which may be relevant to their studies. It would also help them adjust to depending on themselves, rather than on their families for money. In addition, it would also make it easier for these students to find jobs in future as employers would appreciate employees with work experiences. However, students may not have the time to engage in part time jobs. Other than studies, some are involved in charitable activities, clubs and societies, or representing the school or nation in sports. These activities takes up a lot of time and it may not be wise for students to engage in part time jobs as they may tired themselves out. Some students believe that there would be ample time to experience working in the society and saving up money, and hence prefer to engage in school activities, which they may not have a chance to after graduating. Overall, I think it is a personal choice whether to engage in part time jobs or not. Personally, I have been involved in clubs and societies, as well as having various types of part time jobs, and each one gives me different perspective and experiences which I learnt from. ",SIN
"Recently, the situation of smoking have being changed everywhere in Japan. For instance some places have rules that prohibit walking people from smoking. Thus, it is important for us to increase or decrease situations of smoking. Generally, in Japan, people are banned to smoke in public places. Then, we need to consider about not public places, for instance restaurant. I don't agree with the opinion that forgives people to smoke in restaurant. First, there are many family and many children in restaurants. It is more dangerous for them to breath passive smoke than general smokers. Second, seats decrease. It is likely filled up on Saturday and Sunday, so we should remove smoking seats. Third, I don't like cigarette at all. A smell of cigarette is too bad for me, and the smoke is very harmful, so I dislike it. Most important thing I say is that smoking is very harmful for smokers and those around of the smoker. Smoking leads to lung cancer mainly and other disease. Lung cancer may leads to death, so smoking leads to death. Smoking has a harmful influence all people, so it must abolished in restaurant and other places not only public places. I do hope non-cigarette society soon.",JPN
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Roughly, I have two reasons to agree with this proposal. First of all, those who smoke are minority. These days, the population of smoking is decreasing gradually. In fact, according to JT, 10 years ago, 56. 1% of Japanese men smoked. But, in 2005, only 45. 8% of Japanese men smoke. So, no smoking is the trend of these days. We should not ignore this chance. In addition, the rate of Japanese women smoke is only 13. 8%. Simply, only 30% of Japanese people smoke. It is not wise, not efficient to satisfy only 30% of people, and to dissatisfy 70% of people. It is so crazy! So, we need not think about the minority ? those who smoke. We should think about the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers(Jeremy Bentham). Secondly, the smoke of tobaccos makes people who don't smoke feel unhappy. At least, in Japan, eating is regarded as the part of the culture. Eating is the part of our happiness. So, eating is very important, cultural, and holy. But, smoking destroys it. Smoke destroys the perfume, and the taste of meals. No, not only the meals, but also they destroy the culture of eating! So, as it were, smoke is the destroyer. It can call smoke as offender. I can't put up with it! So, I want to expel smoke from restaurants!",JPN
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, for the reason that smokers are (usually) people too. While it is definitely unfair to subject innocents to their second-hand smoke when they're trying to eat, it would also seem unfair to make it impossible for smokers who enjoy smoking before, during or after a meal to do so when eating out, especially in cases where it would not affect others. As someone who is personally hypersensitive to smoke and other funky nasal intrusions, I do believe that certain areas - especially in restaurants, where smell is an important part of the experience - should be kept smoke free. However, when it comes to bigger restaurants in particular, and those that are open-air, having a separate smoking section away from the rest of the restaurant patrons would not hurt anyone. Smokers would get to smoke, non-smokers would get a smoke-free environment, the restaurant would get more money, and everyone would be happy until they see the bill. Alternatively, there could be some restaurants that allow smoking while others ban it completely, and if non-smokers want to eat at a smoking-allowed restaurant, they'll just have to put up with the smoke as a compromise. Likewise, if a smoker wants to eat at a no-smoking-allowed restaurant, they'd also have to compromise by, well, not smoking. Diversity is key: having more options available to meet everyone's needs as best as possible, harming as few as possible in the process. Absolutism of any sort is terrifying, and should never be allowed to stand anywhere outside of a totalitarian society. ",SIN
"Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, is a strong but true statement. This statement shows that the government is taking an active role in the health and welfare of the community. Restaurants where smoking is allowed create a toxic environment for their customers, as well as staff members who inhale the fumes all day. It is commonly known that cigarettes cause cancer and it is well known that the damage to the lungs of secondhand smokers is often severe, if not fatal. This law will encourage smokers to smoke outside in open areas or reduce their smoking. The average time spent in a restaurant is one hour. This is a reasonable amount of time for a smoker to smoke beforehand and refrain from smoking while in the restaurant. However If they choose to leave earlier, there will be more seats available to other customers, thus increasing the chances of profit for the restaurant owner. Smoking restrictions are one way for the government to protect itself from future lawsuits due to secondhand smoke. However, the best way to reduce the number of deaths due to smoking is a serious campaign to educate people on the direct impact cigarette smoke has on their lives and the lives of their families. This is especially true for families with children.",ENS

Having such experiences may give you more chances to get a job in the future when completing with others having no job experiences. Having a job means having salary.

"Since I have spent a lot of time working in pubs, which also serve food, I would have to agree. Before they introduced a lot of the bans throughout the UK, working in the pubs if you were a non-smoker, was pretty disgusting and you would go home smelling like a fireplace every night. A lot of the old guys or older smokers found it hard at first, but then they saw everybody else going outside so they eventually just went outside too doing a lot of complaining mind you, but they got used to it pretty quick. We know a lot about the toxins that are smokes these days and I think everybody around the world pretty well understands that fags will kill you in the end or those you love. A lot of the pubs are pretty small in the UK so that made the stink of the smoke even worse. Since coming to Japan, I see nearly the same thing as far as space goes, small spaces many smokers. The thing is though, is that it might be one thing to smoke in a bar or pug, but I think that it's a bit much when everybody is smoking throughout the local family restaurant because there is also a lot of young kids there who don't have much say in what happens to them.

And Courier, pubs serving, jjugumi serving, serving seafood, etc. I will discuss part-time job. A part time job is a job in which an employee does not work full hours. Employment in a part-time job has advantages and disadvantages which need to be carefully weighed when one is considering employment options. Typically, an employment announcement or job vacancy listing will indicate whether a position is full or part time, as the number of hours offered is important to many people. Part time jobs may also be referred to as part time employment, or PTE. A part time job often has the advantage of more flexible hours. Sometimes employees can at least partially dictate their own schedules, thereby setting up a job which is in alignment with life and other needs. Part-time jobs may also offer benefits such as discounts to employees, and in some regions of the world, as long as employee works at least half time, he or she is eligible for other employee benefits as well. These benefits may include sick pay, insurance, payments into pension funds, or vacation time. In other cases, these benefits are not offered; this is one of the biggest disadvantages of a part time job.",KOR

" Nowadays, too many people are absorbed in smoking, they can't help to smoke in public places. This phenomenon has already become a hot topic in society. Some people think it doesn't matter to smoke in public places, because each citizen has his or her right to do what he or she wants. But I think it should be forbidden. Smoking in public places is not only a thing of your own, you may disturb others. If there is a person with lung disease nearby, and you light the cigarettes one by one, you may do a very bad thing to him or her. On the other hand, many smokers always leave cigarette ends around, it's really bad to our environment and public tidy. When I visited Shanghai Expo Park with my parents, we saw some smoking areas. As we know, Shanghai Expo Park got together more than 200 thousands visitors all over the world each day. So everything in it might show our culture to the world. Since people didn't smoke here and there, the air in the park is clean and the environment is pretty. We showed to the world that China was a polite country. We Chinese are all proud of our own. At the same time, smokers had no need to suffer from the strong feeling that they want to smoke, they could go to the smoking area to do what they wanted. It's humanized. It can kill two birds with one stone. The conclusion is smoking in public places should be forbidden, while some special areas should be set up. Let's make our life better together.",CHN
"In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that people should have meals at restaurants.

The second reason is that when smoking is completely banned at restaurants the smoke may come to non-smoking sheets. Smoking is completely banned at some restaurants but there are smoking sheets and non-smoking sheets at most of restaurants in Japan. I think this is not good. I insist that restaurants should remove all smoking sheets. And the third reason is that smoking is harmful for everyone's health at all.

In brief, smoking should be ban in any restaurant in Thailand. Right is the important reason, we should pay respect to other people in our society.

In some schools they forbid students working part time because it would violate the school policy unfortunately it does not stop the students from going to different kind of jobs for extra cash. But working part times doesn't mean that the student needs money to sustain themselves but also their families, there are some cases that when some of the said student's parents cannot afford the tuition of the school the students would likely take matters into their own hands by stopping their education and working part time of occasionally full time jobs.

So the student should find to do a little task (part-time job) for the new various experience such as conversation with people, planning the time, practice our tolerance, bring your knowledge to apply with the part-time job etc. Moreover the students will get the good suggestion from people who did work before. However we shouldn't leave our studying because we are students who have the main work which is learning more and more to get a lot of knowledge.

"I think that I've agree the part time job is important to college student, if you ask the other's people, I think you will get the same answer, too. Why do I have this conclusion? Let me explain why I have the idea. First, college student to do the part time job can learn something that can't learn in the school, likes specialty skills, social skills. In the society, you can't do the wrong as you can; you should be avoid the mistake when you're working. In the school, teacher or classmates can be endure your mistake, and give you some tips or suggestion. Second, it's not that everybody be rich, somebody does the part time job that is earning more money to lighten the parents burden, but if you're rich, you maybe not to be frugal because you don't know how making economical is very important. So doing a part time job can let you to know burden is being in need. Third, doing a part time job is useful to your job in future, in the modern society, experience is very important, if you don't have any experience, I think you wii be a hard way to find a job. Fourth, you can meet the different people in your part time store, it's develop your personal networks opportunity, I think it's very useful. Four points of the above, it's my point as issue, and it can hold my inference faultless.",TWN
"Recently, there's a heated discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job, Different people have different opinions. Some people think that college students' most important task is studying, not making money, while other people do not agree it. In their opinion, college students should learn not only book knowledge, but also other technologies. Frankly speaking, I don't like having a part-time job. Because, it occupies amount of my part-time and I have to pay much of my attention and energy to it. But, I do agree that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job. Here are my reasons. Firstly, having a part-time job can bring us some financial income. This is the most visible benefit. We can lighten the burden on our family by doing some part-time job and improve our own living standard. Secondly, we may get some social experience which is useful to our future job-hunt. Thirdly, we can learn a lot of skills through doing part-time job. The college students are all good at book learning. But, most of the students are lack of practical experience. So, I think, it is necessary to have some part-time job to improve our mixed ability.",CHN
"Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in China? Many people think so, I think it is a very realistic problem. As we all know, smoking is bad to our health. What's more, it's influence people around you. Restaurants is a place that you should pay attention to your behavior and manner very well. So from this point, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. But in the other hand, however, don't think so. Some people feel that smoking shouldn't be banned at the restaurants. In fact, it is a complicated thing. We cannot lightly say should or shouldn't. It influenced by many factors, first of all, it is difficult for government to control smoking people's quantity. And if there has supplies, there has needs. If smoking is not be allowed in the restaurants, what will the people who really want to smoking do? In case of myself, I think instead of smoking in our own seats, the restaurants should make some special places for us to smoking. It will not only good for smokers, but also the others.

"Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is a serious behavior to smoke at restaurant and we should not allow this condition. Should smoking be banned at all restaurants in our country? The answer is not so easy, of course. I think we can solve the problem in the restaurant by other way not just completely ban it. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to the smokers and in the meantime to others. Although those people have been addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the others' health in public. Moreover, it is common believed that smoking destroy the elegant atmosphere at the restaurant. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. Something must be done in the restaurant to deal with the problem of whether we can smoke in the restaurant. In my opinion, we can set up a public place especially for smokers.",CHN
"For the past two years, I have been working part time with an international non-government organization named One Million Lights. Although it's technically a part time job, I perform and operate under the capacity of the Country Head of the Philippines for the organization.

Aside from the demands debate and football varsity impose on me, I also have to deal with high expectations in and out of my family. My part time job takes me to another world.

"I don't agree Topic B. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. What all student have to do is study hard. We pay university tuition at university in order to go university. But university tuition is expensive. Most of the students don't have a lot of money. So many students receive university tuition and living expenses from their parents. If students' parents do not have money for paying university tuition, students don't go university and take a class. Even they cannot see their friends. To go university, many students seek jobs. Or they drop out their university. If students have a part-time job day and night, they can't continue to take a class because they can't spent time in studying. All university students will lead to the world in the future. Many people said that ""If students don't have a lot of money for paying university tuition, they can receive scholarship in the university. "" But what many students receive scholarship is difficult. Because scholarship is little money than university tuition. We need to remember, a duty of all students is to study hard. So the nation has to support university tuition to students.",KOR
"Personally, I do not think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The importance must be compared relative to something. Why is it important? Is it important because the student needs it to support himself and his family? Or is it important because the student needs to buy the upcoming Chanel bag? If it is the former, it will be considered important. Also, the student must also be able to make sure that he/she is able to deal with the amount of school work and have good time management before he/she decides to commit to a part-time job. For example, I had a part time job when I was in NUS year 1. I realized that my grades actually suffered for the first semester because I was too preoccupied with my part time job. Although it was a job at a bookstore and I enjoyed working there and interacting with my colleagues, I had to make a decision to quit the job. It was a job that was important to me because I do not receive any allowances from my parents, hence I had to make money on my own in order to purchase school books, afford transportation and daily expenses. Fortunately, I was eligible to apply for bursaries so my life is much easier. I can't wait to graduate so I can get a full time job and support my family! ",SIN

Moreover, the restaurant is the place we eat and enjoy the happiness with our families, friends and our lovers. The important and joy time should not be broken by the annoying smell of smoke. In my opinion, the smoker should find other way replace the smoking behavior. Maybe do some sport, read books even singing loudly can help one to get rid of the smoking.

It damages the health of whose smoking it, and it's a great cause of canner. It leads to be dead if who smoke it a lot and for long time. It is not good for others who near them too, they might get the smoke. Next, I think smoking in the public such as in the restaurants is not good and it is a bad behavior because it is not a good thing to do in public. Maybe parents bring their kids to have breakfast, lunch or dinner at the restaurants. They might see adults are smoking and someday they might imitate when their parents away home or maybe they will do it in school with friends. That is not a good behavior to do in front of children. Finally, smoking is caused to lost a lot of money that they might not know. People who are smoking it have to spend money to buy it. Even it isn't cast too much but if take it for long time its can be a lot by nonsense things.

First, I think in the university we learned things which is just about our profession. So it is very narrow. We should learn other knowledge from doing a part-time job.

"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? In my opinion I think it should be that because smoking leads to many health problems such as lung cancer and many problems about lung. The disease occurs because in the cigarette has a Tar, Nicotine which is a ""Cacinogen"" (substance that leads to cancer). However, I will not talk about the person who usually smokes because they also surely know that what will happen with their health in the future when they decide to smoke. On the other way I will talk about the person who does not smoke but is affected by smoking because of smoking in public such as restaurants, subway station, bus stop, taxi stand or something like that. I think the government should aware about this problem because people who do not smoke are affected although they do not smoke but they just stand in wrong place and wrong time.

So smoking does harm not only to himself but also to them. It smells bad. As a result, non-smokers are also equal to smoker in smoking. So many restaurants are divided two seat types, for smoker and for non-smoker. However, when I went to the restaurant, smokers' seats were vacant and non-smokers' seats were filled with people. Not only visitor but also restaurant loses in many ways. Perhaps, there are people who say, I can't live, if there no tobacco in my life. They should smoke out of the restaurant.

"Smoking itself has been portrayed to us as a negative externality, not just to the smoker himself but also to the people around him and his environment. Despite all the consequences, smoking is nonetheless present, and we have to acknowledge the presence of smokers. If that is so, why ban smoking in all the restaurants? Are we condemning their actions, or are we restricting them in some ways, although we might not have the rights to control them? In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This perspective is also supported by the government for they have since banned smoking in most public places, and having designated smoking areas for smokers. Although it is unfair for smokers to be restricted because no one has a right over them even if they are a minority, but the very fact that their actions causes harm not just to them but the people around them makes it more justified because then, their individual choice of smoking does not just affect themselves. However, we acknowledge the needs of smokers and often smokers include high profile professionals who have high disposable income. Smoking could be an avenue for them to de-stress. Given that the target audience of restaurants include these people who are affluent, it would not be fair to ban smoking at restaurants because the venue might be for a social affair. Smoking amongst business executives and colleagues could also be a social affair.

"Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Second-hand smoke is a known carcinogen and detrimental to the health of all who inhale it. To allow smoking in restaurants, or in any public space for that matter, is to wilfully allow harm to come to all those within that space - smokers and non-smokers alike. Citizens must have the right to a safe environment in which to enjoy a meal or to work or to live. Smoking in restaurants cannot stand if Japan is to respect the rights of its citizens. This does not mean that Japan is to ban smoking wholesale; it remains a right in liberal societies for individuals to choose to expose themselves to risk within limits. However, this individual right to expose oneself to risk cannot supersede the collective right to safety of all citizens within a given public space. The freedom of individuals or groups of individuals to smoke within a non-public space, say on privately owned property, is not affected or contested. Although some workarounds have been proposed, one cannot assume that only smokers will be present within a given public space. Even if Japan were to mandate the use of separately ventilated smoking-rooms in order to segregate smokers and non-smokers, this would only potentially protect patrons of the restaurant. Staff who service the smoking-rooms would still be harmed by exposure to the smoke. To hire only smokers to service the rooms would be tantamount to promoting discriminatory hiring policies. Asking for employee consent to work in a smoking-room would be equally unacceptable as it leads to a choice between livelihood or health. A complete ban on smoking at all restaurants is the only way to avoid these pitfalls.",ENS
"It is important for college students to hold part-time jobs. Firstly, I will discuss the benefits of managing both schoolwork and part-time job concurrently. This means careful allocation of time between the student's studies, his or her part-time job as well as family and social life. A student who successfully manages to strike a balance between the above will gain invaluable time-management skills which is an essential tool useful when he or she embarks on further studies, career and when he or she start a family. Holding a part-time job, whether or not during school term or off-school period, teaches a student several other important lessons too. One, it teaches them that things do not come easily or the way a person wants it to go. This means that they will learn not to take what their parents provide for them for granted such as the value of money. Two, they will have a taste of independence in the sense that they are earning some pocket money on their own. That means they will have to work hard to earn for the things they desire. Three, working part-time often offer fresh insights on a lot of issues hence students who work part-time are often more mature than their peers. However, having a part-time job does have its disadvantages. Holding a part-time job while studying often means that something else has got to give way, be it schoolwork, parents or friends. Young people often lack the ability to manage time well and in the process of acquiring such ability, they often learn the lesson the hard way such as subpar school grades. In conclusion, there are merits and shortcomings to having a part-time job but it depends on the motivation for one to work while studying. More often than not, they are forced into it by circumstances such as to supplement the family's low household income. ",SIN

"As far as I am concerned, I think that there should be no smoking in restaurants. As everyone knows, smoking does nothing good for our body.

Moreover, the odor also destroys others' appetite when eating. Seeing delicious foods in front of us, but we cannot enjoy eating them is a mysterious thing. Therefore, it is important to promote people not to smoke in restaurants. In my opinion, first of all, good regulations are necessary to be made. With definite regulations, people could have the principle to abide by. Secondary, having the knowledge of the bad influences coming from smoking, people also need to have resolution to prevent themselves and encourage others not to smoke in public, especially, in order to have a good atmosphere in restaurants.

"Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. To be even more audacious, I believe that smoking should be abolished from this planet. After all, smoking has no benefits to the human body, besides giving one a temporary relief from stress, which can be eased through other means. The only benefit smoking have for the world, is only an economical one, whereby the demand for cigarettes fuels jobs and trade. Yet, these economic benefits are negated by the medical fees one pays after develop lung cancer and various health complications smoking brings. Not only that, the death and psychological suffering that comes with the health implications is immeasurable. I would confidently say that the world will be a better place if smoking is abolished and permanently extinguished from our planet. Although the immediate implications would be a sudden loss of jobs and possible chaos in countries that specialize in trade of cigarettes, I firmly believe that the long term impacts will be positive. That being said, the answer to whether smoking should be completely banned in restaurants, is obvious. Smoking in restaurant not only irritates other customers and reflect bad social consciousness, it also brings great health implications to others. I believe the no greater emphasis has been placed on the dangers of secondhand smoke and everyone is well aware of it. To continue smoking in public and even at home only goes to reveal the selfishness of the individual, to put everyone around him/her at risks. It does not matter why one picked up smoking.

"Hong Kong Government is now to completely ban smoking in all of the restaurants. In my opinion, I think it is a great measure made by Hong Kong Government. The reasons are as follows, First, smoking banning is good measure to help people have a healthy body. As smoking will emit some gases which harm other people when they inhale these gases from the first hand smoking. As people absorb these second-hand smoking, people will be harmed by these gases which will affect their lungs and make them suffered from cancer. Also, this measure can boost the profit of the restaurants as the environment of the restaurants become better. People will come into the restaurants to consume and will stay longer to eat. This may left a good image in the costumers' brain. So the reputation of the restaurants will become better rather than the day before the measure imposed.

"As a non-smoker, I would definitely like to have a blanket smoking ban on all restaurants in the country, and if possible, to even criminalize smoking and make it illegal everywhere in Singapore. But I do recognize that the choices of others' should be respected even though I may not agree with them and even if the scientific evidence strongly suggest that smoking is bad for health. To be fair to the smokers, they do pay a hefty tobacco tax in Singapore and this tax revenue has been used to fund the various social welfare programs. Though I respect the individual's right to smoke, actions have to be taken by the government when the actions of this group of people produce a negative externality to non-smokers. We have heard of the dangers of inhaling second-hand smoke and in this regard, smokers' rights must be balanced with responsibilities. Smokers can continue on smoking as long as non-smokers do not have to be forced to inhale their second-hand smoke. Therefore, all measures should be taken to ensure that non-smokers have access to smoke-free zones in restaurants. This however does not mean that smoking need to be banned at all restaurants. It just means taking sufficient safeguards to segregate restaurants into smoking and smoke-free zones, and making sure that the smoke does not diffuse into the smoke-free zone. Another possibility would be to have speciality restaurants which cater only to smokers where they can smoke all they want (and inhale the second-hand smoke of others) while enjoying their meal.

"The pros of banning smoking especially at restaurants in Japan far outweigh any temporary dissatisfaction that may be felt by the smokers who feel that they are being persecuted for their lifestyle. To begin with, smoking is in every way a very dirty habit. Not only does it make the homes, clothes, and possessions of smokers forever tainted by that terrible smell, it also increases litter and trash on the streets. For some reason, smokers seem to think that it is okay to throw cigarette butts anywhere they feel like, and nothing makes a street look more dirty or poor than thousands of cigarettes strewn about. Furthermore, I hope that smoking will become banned at more than just restaurants but in all public places. At the same time, I think it is only fair to provide the smokers with a place to smoke, so I think designated places should be established. However, many cities and governments are not willing to expend the effort or the funds that would be necessary to accomplish such a feat, and if this is true for the Japanese, it may be a long time before smoking is banned at restaurants. Therefore, nonsmokers will have to be patient while the gears of government slowly grind and the red tape and slowly unravels.",ENS

"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. One reason is that college students need money to play or have meals with their friends.

The other reason is that they should get use to working before they graduate from college. I think society is severe and really different from college. If we don't work hard, we may lose our jobs. When we work, we have a lot of chances to work with people who are in different posts from us. In order to do well with them, we need experiences. I have a part-time job and I realize that it is difficult to earn money and that working is not interesting. Many students have a part-time job two or three days per a week. I think that is good because we should get use to society gradually. I have a friend who works in a restaurant. She works until a. m. two or three o'clock. So she is often late for the class.

The benefit about part-time job it can share the tired from their parents, can have money for using, have new friends, know how to work, and can manage time. In time to work they can know that how to work and make friends in the same time. The disadvantage of it is when they work in night time, can have the bad event happening. Some time they back home and tire it show that not have enough time to review the lessons. Part-time job has benefits and disadvantages in the same. If you can do it in the right way it will has a lot of benefit for you. You must manage time for your work and study well.",THA

We spend our free time very benefits and we can train from work and we increase our skill because we have more responsibility in work and study.

Job that we have to do, we must appreciate with the work. We must happy to do and it must safe to do. We should tell our parents about part time so they don't worry about us. We have many choice to choose place to work such as KFC, MK restaurants, SEVENSEN ice cream shop, etc. The reasons that student choose to work should be experience rather than money. The work takes many significant but it can destroy the study result. Both of them should be perfect if you can't do it just study only.

"Smoking is a bad habit. It became fatal. Smoking produces fatal diseases. The people that involve in smoking they show wastage of time. In restaurant smokers are affected on the other people & the people of villages and passenger that come to the restaurant. Some are very simple and innocent they are not able to observe the life and clever people that want to destroy the life of humanity in the world. The simple people entangled in the net of smokers. The smokers first of all give a cigarette to the innocent people by saying that it is better for the pain of the badly and after smoking this you feel betterment. In this way the innocent people become prey of the smokers. To smoking destroy the life of the smokers. Due to smoking smoker's loss the memory, mindlessness and many other fatal diseases.

"A Minute of Heaven and an Hour of Hell The health problem brought by smoking is not a new issue for the most of us. We were flooded with news and reports dealing with the harmful effects of the use of cigarettes. Also there had been innumerable protests and undertakings launched to prohibit smoking on public places. And now, with the calling to ban smoking on restaurants all over the country, I am now ready to take my part. I do agree to ban smoking on all restaurants in the country for the following reasons: First: restaurants are public places and smoking on public places entails hazardous effects not just on the smoker himself but also to the other people on those public places, because even non-smoker might inhale the smoke produce from the use of cigarettes, which as we know, brought several lung diseases. Second: it is very disrespectful and ungentle to smoke while other people are having a good time in their lunch or dinner. Third: restaurant is a place for people to eat and not a place for people to smoke. Banning smoking on restaurants might also lessen the number of people who suffer from lung diseases caused by the different chemicals contained even in a single stick.",PHL
"Traditionally, university student will most often focus on their study first before turning to other activities to fill up the time. Lately, more and more students are eager to have a part-time job as soon as they made it into college. This, to certain extent, will affect their academic records which is a huge issues for the students. So, should university students take any part time jobs? First of all, university is the final step before you make your jump into the society. And in the society, academic excellence will only contribute a tiny bit to your chance of getting a prospective job. With so many applicants fulfilling this criteria, your ability to show other attributes will provide a significant edge over the other candidates. One of those qualities should be previous working experience. After all, education is only theoretical modeled, but when you are asked to showcase your knowledge through solving daily problems or completing relevant tasks, it is an entirely different matter. Also, when you have worked before, the time needed to adapt will be much fewer than novice. Secondly, some of the students' family may not be that well off, so the students will need to support themselves. And there doesn't seem to a lot of means on offer to fund your study than getting a part time job. So, getting a part time job will be critical here. Whether or not it's for experience or money, I would say university students should be allowed to have part time job.",HKG
Smoking should be banned at all hotels in the country. Smoking is a social evil. It is curse for every society. It is not a sign of healthy nation. Any person who falls in this bad activity slowly ends his life by this own hands. It is a kind of drug. In any country hotels or more famous for the curse like smoking drug addiction. Smoking is dangerous for the health for the person who smokes. But the smoke of cigarette also affects the person who sits around the smoker. So at hotels there are many person along with the smokers who are affected by this dangerous smoke. The manufactures uses a very dangerous compound nicotine which kills are person slowly and goes in to the mouth of death. So it is important for the government or especially power full people to stop this bad activity. Especially in hotels but this step we can also give an end to many other bad activities along with the smoking. There should be less adds of cigarettes. And government should ban all the people who work in such adds. These adds make it a fashion for the other. Thus smoking can be stopped.,PAK
"I agree with the statement is that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. You can image if you aren't a smoker sitting in a restaurant and next to you there is a smoker. How do you feel? Restaurants are public area, where I think that is not appropriate for smoking. Smoking at all restaurants can make bad atmosphere and cause an adverse health to non smokers in that area. First of all, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because it makes bad atmosphere. Smoking nears non smokers can be considered as impolite manner in many or every countries because of its bad smell. Smoking smell can make air become bad and most of people who come to restaurants may be unsatisfied at those restaurants. It also can make the conversation in a group of non smokers stopped. In addition to smoking in restaurants should be banned because it causes a bad healthy to a group of non smokers. Smoking cigarette can cause many bad effects and cancer diseases. These adverse effects are not just impact to smokers but also non smokers who get air of smoking. Unfortunately, the non smokers may be more getting adverse effects than the smokers even they do not smoke but do inhale directly. In conclusion, smoking at restaurants should be banned in the country because it creates bad air atmosphere and cause bad effects to your health.",THA
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. First, college students have much time than junior high school students and working people. So, college students have to use some time for working. If they have a lot of time, they often use the time for only playing. If they use it for part-time job, they may get something good for their life. This is the second reason. College students can learn a lot of things that they can't learn in only the college. They can learn, for example, the difficulty of making money, system of the society, and they can also learn the feeling that they should thank their parents. Third, I think that college students should be independent of their parents, because college students aren't children, they are almost adults. It is difficult that they are independent from their parents completely, but it is important to do that in some points. One of the points I think is having a part-time job. They should make money that they use for playing. If the money they can earn is small, the action can help their parents, I think. Those are the reasons why I think college students should have part-time job.",JPN
"Smoking has become very common and fashionable especially nowadays the youngsters. Usually, this habit begins outside friend and tries to experiment how to use and the new things that they had. Actually, despite the warning given by the doctors about the ill-effects of smoking but people will continue to smoke. Smokers are addicted to it, and even if they cannot control in how many pieces to using it. Probably each of us has experience in a situation, when you are setting in the restaurant and someone near to started to smoke a cigarettes and I was annoying those people to take cigarettes because I 'm not the one using it. So we became unwillingly second-hand smokers. I wish smoking would be banned in the public places. The smoke not only is unpleasant but it is also unhealthy. The smoker not only damages his/her own health, but also the heath of others. Well, would better is to banned smoking in the public places, especially in the restaurants. Restaurants are for eating not smoking. They raise the tax which may stop a few people, raising the tax too high would stop too many people for them. Smoking is the worst habit in the entire world? A number of people increase the ill-effect of smoking to cause of cancer that's why people suffering like this. Hopefully this time the government gives the resolution the problem that they had.",PHL
"Is important for college students to have a part-time job? What the part-time job is so important for most college student? These are good questions for nowadays college students. In my opinion, I think the part-time job is very important for the college student for the following reasons. The first reason is that the student can learn the job experiences. About eighty to ninety percent of college in Taiwan when they graduated they should be find out their job. If they had the job experiences, it will be better than other who didn't have any job experience. And when the college student in the part-time job, they also learn something that don't teach in the class. I thought the second reason is that the college student can find out which job is suitable for him in his part-time job. Most students who didn't worked before after they graduated they will spend long time to find out what kind of job is suitable for him or whether they can have interest in the job. I think this is a very important, because most people just work for work or the money. If they are no interest in the job, not only is very tough for him, it also make lower the job appearance. And the college student if they have the part-time job, they will know which job is more suitable for them and it is also save the time to looking for the job when they graduate. In conclusion, I think the part-time job is so important for the college student for these two reasons, to get the experience and find out the job interest. For these two reasons, I strongly believe that the part-time job is benefit for the college student, and is good for their future job.",TWN
"I agree with it is important for college students to have a part time job. As we know, the cost for college student is too much (in this case, we can say expensive). It's easy if the parent from that students is rich people. But, how about the students with contrary condition? So, part time job its better solution for this situation. The student can help the parent to don't lost the cost too much. In the other hand, the students have new experience beside their daily activity(studying). The students must be smart to split their time. Because they add new activity for their time, studying and have a part time job. It's proudly can get their money by themselves than they must ask money from their parents as requirements in college. In my opinion, they are independent student. If all college students do that, I think the parents don't worry about financial problem. And for that student, it can be a start before they work at company after they graduate from that college. Maybe we can say its training to get a new skill for a job. So it's positive think for that student. In this era, nothing to say shine for do a something. If we can, why not? We can learn from college student who have a part time job. They get money with themselves, so they help they parents. And I think they make proud their parent with what they are doing.",IDN

"Smoking is when tobacco is burnt and inhaled into one's body. There are many disadvantages to smoking. Smoking causes lung cancer. Smoking causes one to have bad breath and yellow tinted nails. Smoking is addictive and is a waste of money. The only reason why smokers continue to smoke despite this harmful effects is that smoking allows them to be high, and to feel good. this I feel, is outrageous, I do not see how getting lung cancer in the long run could make one feel good about themselves, and the people around them. This smoking behaviour which they deemed to be cool, is the most irresponsible behaviour one could ever have. All the smokers think about is those few minutes of feeling good from inhaling those nasty stuff down their lungs, and does not spare a thought for the people around them. I find smoking a complete waste of time and money. I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As much as i wish they would be banned, this would cause unhappiness among the smokers. However i feel that smokers should only be allowed to smoke outdoor. By smoking indoor, they can cause others to breathe in unnecessary second hand smoke, which is very inconsiderate to other users. As much as i wish smoking could be banned across the country i understand that a far bit of tax revenue comes from ciggarette, however is it rightful of the government to generate tax this way? to generate tax at the expense of its citizens? i do not think so. for the health of every one in the country i feelthat smoking should be as illegal as how marijuana is. it is a drug as well, how is it less severe.

"In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It has been proved that second-hand smoking will cause lung cancer easier than someone who smokes. Usually, restaurants are indoor space. If someone smokes in the restaurants, most people there will get the second-hand smoke easily. It is not fair to people who do not smoke, because they take more risk of lung cancer than people who smoke. And the smell of it is really bad. Someone who smokes has a very heavy smell of smoking on him or her. When you walk by him or her, you will smell it and feel bad on him or her. For example, I have a friend who smokes. But before her smoke I think he is a good girl, and like to get along with her. Someday I smell a weird smell on her so I asked her what was that smell and she told me that she smokes. Even though we are still friends now, I will not want to get to close to her when she has the smoking smell on her. Smoking will make others have different opinions about you, and it is always bad opinion. So smoking should be banned not only at all the restaurants but also in all public places.",TWN
Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because it is a public place. Not all the customers in a particular restaurant are smokers. Second-hand smoke is more dangerous. It causes many diseases to people and to our environment. If they keep on smoking in public places like restaurants it will have bad effects to the health of the other customers and also to the business. They might not come back because of the bad environment causing by the smokers. It causes pollution. Our environment also has its right. It will decrease the customers coming from a particular restaurant. And smoking to public places attracts young generation to do this. The government should do something about this issue because it is not just about the health of the people it is also about business. Banning smoking in public places will give justice to non-smokers. We live in a democratic country so people who smoke have also their rights. They can do it by isolating themselves in order not to cause any problems to others. A smoker's choice should not affect the health of other people. Anyone is not permitted to cause harm to people's health. Banning smoking in public places will also benefit the smokers.,PHL

"I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are 3 reasons for that. First, they can earn money to enjoy their campus lives. Almost all the college students want to enjoy their campus life. But, without money, they couldn't enjoy happy things such as going to the theater, traveling abroad, doing outdoor activity and so on. What is worse, without money, they couldn't continue cultural life as a human being! (having meals, washing clothes and so on) They also lose chances to experience various kinds of things which will benefit them when they become members of society. For example, a man who traveled abroad in his school days can easily make friends with people who come to Japan for business. Second, they can experience many jobs. A part-time job usually requires less responsibility than a full-time job. So, college students can go to various kinds of business communities and learn introduction to various kinds of jobs. In other words, they can acquire many skills with less responsibility in their school days. Through experiencing various jobs, they may find a suitable job. And if they the job, they can find new jobs thanks to the skills acquired in their school days! Third, they can learn the systems of society. For example, they can learn how money circulates or how to make good connection with people. These knowledge will be very useful when they become members of society.",JPN
"We do know that smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Every year, millions of people die of lung cancers due to smoking. Smoking is damaging people every day. Yet, smoking should not be banded completely at all the restaurants in China. My views are as follows. Things that exist must have values. In China's long history, smoking dates back to centuries ago. There must be reasons why so many people smoke. Smoking can make people have a good break after exhausting physical work. Also, many women say that they feel safe when they smoke. Artists say that they have flash ideas when they smoke. Writers also say they can not write down any word without smoking. Many people also have the habit of smoking during meals. If people can not drop the habit, why not produce cigarettes with higher qualities? It will be harmless of they don't breathe in the toxic nicotine. Smoking should be reduced but not banned completely. Many people say they can not do anything without cigarettes. Thus, it will not be a good idea to ban smoking. People who smoke during meals will feel that nothing is tasty if they are banned smoking. It would be better that we accept that fact and think of ways to solve the problem. In summary, banning smoking is not the only way to solve problems. Change an angle to think. Producing better and healthier cigarettes way be of vital importance.",CHN
"As smoking is such a harmful and selfish habit that I think it should be totally banned in public places. Smoking is harmful not only to the smokers, but also to people around them. If someone smokes in the public places, such as restaurants, or underground station, everyone around him will be forced to take in the second-hand smoke. According to the research, second-hand smoke is even worse than smoke. Even a single person smokes in public places, all the people around him will be harmed by cigarettes. Smoking also will ruin people's appetite and mood. Imagine someone is smoking while you are having delicious food. How unpleasant could it be! It's such a selfish behavior because the smoking person may feel good but people around him will be very uncomfortable. Further more, not smoking in the public places can also show people's respect because nobody will feel good if someone is smoking while talking to him, or even being around him. In my opinion, not smoking should be a kind of social manner. Smoking in the public is a bad habit that should be discouraged. If no one is smoking in the public places, then the air will be fresher, food will be more delicious, and people will be more friendly.",CHN
"Holding a part-time job as a college student showcases two qualities of the student, independence and inertia to constantly upgrade his/her skillset. Thus, it is vital for college students to hold a part-time job, specifically in the field of their interest. The purpose of college is to equip students with the literacy requirement of their field, however, practical knowledge is just as essential for one to fill in the position competently. Internships are encouraged for students to explore their future job scope and decide for themselves if they are suitable or satisfied with the working environment. Besides the need for experience, a part-time job provides college student with a source of income that parallels the amount of allowance they receive from their parents. For low-income households, the importance of the job is significantly higher. As college students, the remunerations of the part-time may not be high, once again providing the economy a source of relatively competent source of labour for a low cost, this results in a potentially high profit margin. As the amount of college students are replenished yearly, the market will have an endless supply of manpower. While the economic benefits and the personal gratification are plentiful, we must always remember that ultimately, the job provides college students with social interaction. People from all walks of life will sculpt their personalities and attitude and the benefits are intangible. College education aims to provide textual knowledge but the impact on students ""attitude is relatively insignificant compared to the gains of working part-time. The importance is attributed to the tangibles and intangibles gains. ",SIN
"There are a lot of people are addicted to smoking. So many people like smoking in the public without other's health and warnings. Why? Perhaps they think it is cool for them to light a cigarette and blow the smoke to the air. Or they form a habit of having a cigar in the mouth. But it's really a bad behavior in the public for both yourself and others around you. From my point of view, smoking in the public places will bring about a lot of problems. First, it do harm to anyone who around you. Cause these people are victim smokers. And among them, perhaps there're someone who are ill or sick, if they smell your smoke, they will get worse or evenly die. Second, if you smoke in the public places, our fresh air will be dirty in this limited space. Public space belongs to everyone and no one have the right to pollute it. Everyone have their obligation to contribute to our society and we shouldn't do something bad to our society. Finally, there will be more rubbish on the street such as the dog-ends. And if the lighting dog-ends are thrown carelessly, perhaps a fire will be set and it will lead to a tragedy. So it is meaningful to ban smoking in the public places. As we all know that people in our society should be of the educated men.

" As is the common phenomenon, many people tend to smoke before and after meals in restaurants, thus influencing other people more or less. However, I don't agree completely ban smoking at all restaurants. First of all, I strongly doubt it can be accomplished. Imagine there are countless restaurants all over the county and countless people eat in them. How can we conduct this order in reality, by force? I don't think it's proper. And most restaurant are not willing to do it for it may drive many customers away. Above all customers are free to smoke, and they deserve the rights to enjoy the rights which doesn't harm others obviously, either. So the communication between waiters and customers who are likely to stick to their own ideas remain to be trouble. Besides, we can't ban a thing just because of its slight harm. Needless to say, the cigarette producing has made up the great shares in GDP. And if we ban smoking in restaurants, the producing must decrease sharply. What's more, as we know, the emissions from cars do great harm to our health, can we ban car driving in the street? Furthermore, it has become a habit to give cigarettes to others to show your respect. It is also a part of table manners. So people may naturally take out cigarettes at meals. Once a tradition is deeply rooted in everyone's heart, the first thing we can do is not to ban it but to improve or change it. So I think we can invent some healthy cigarettes to solve it. Or we can divide the restaurant into several parts, in some of which smoking is allowed. So considering the current situation, I don't think to ban smoking in all restaurants is proper.",CHN

When I was 21years old, I could stop smoking because I entered the army. Just 30 days, I couldn't buy tobacco, so I could cut smoking forcibly. That time, a few days after giving up smoking, I started to suffer from withdrawal symptoms. But 30 days after, I went to furlough, I started smoking again. For this reason, I couldn't control myself. I think my patience is very poor. Above all things, if you cut the smoking, you need to learn to be more patient. Lacking in patience people never succeed in quit smoking. Here are some method raise your patients. First, eat candy instead of smoking time. Second, when do you feel withdrawal symptoms, let's do exercise!! These are so subjective. But many of people that use this method when they feel withdrawal symptoms. Do your best for stopping smoke. I hope that you feel better soon.",KOR
"Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I think my answer is YES. You can learn more and more experiments and earn money by yourself, if you have a part-time job in your free time. My high schoolmate has working since she was 16. After she started in her work, she became independent and responsible person. Now, she is a college student, she pays her tuition, she can buy anything that she likes, she got great grade, and her parents don't worry about her. In my case, I had a part-time job in last summer vacation. Though it was only two months, I still learned a lot of things. I really felt happy and proud, when I got my first income. It is good to do something by myself. I want to have a part-time job when I become to sophomore. I think that it is helpful to have a part-time job after school. It not only you can earn money, but helps you to know the society earlier. You can learn things earlier than the other that don't have part-time job. It is important for college students to have a part-time job, and that would be a wonderful experiment in your college life.",TWN
"I don't agree to a college student to have a part-time job is important. Studying is the top 1 to students, always we have a lot of homework and tests, so we don't have other time to handle part-time job. Maybe some students need money to keep themselves life that is ok, but some students just want to buy a lot something they like which have very high price not the comstudents can pay for one and they could buy more and more that is very bad circle, if they can keep their money to bank or give their parents, maybe the condition is better. Part of part-time job are very tired, if human feel tired who didn't want to study, that is over a student should to do. Maybe we can from those part-time jobs get some experience but not every part-time job could do. Maybe for some students they don't get grade they just nothing to do, so they just want a com-part-time job, not have any soul in their future. I feel time is money, to do part-time job just now can get money but not in future, if we spent the same time in studying in future we can get more and more money but not now. So I don't agree.",TWN
"More and more students have a part-time job nowadays. Their reasons are different. Most of them take the job as a way to earn their living expenses, while the rest of them just want to practice their abilities and to broad their horizon. On the one hand, I don't think that it is essential for college student to get a part-time job. One year before I took my first part-time job as a saleswoman, I found it really boring after I cooked noodle for 3 days. It really hit me so much; as a result, I think I will never eat instant noodles. As we are too young to take the professional task, we always play the unimportant roles. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the part-time job can exercise one's character. During the working hours, there may be many challenges for you. When you feel failed, when you get tired, and so on, it's high time to challenge yourself and to prove yourself. As every coin has two sides, taking part-time job is a good way to feel the reality and the society. You'd better try for one time. But you face with a tradeoff. We always say the words Opportunity Cost, which means when you choose something, at the same time you need to give up something. If you want more money and more experience, your studying time is being taken the place. It all depends to you. From my viewpoint, it is important for college students to have a part-time job even for just one time. But it is not essential. You have to count the cost, and then to make a decision. And making the fullest of your part time, balancing the percent of job and study also make sense.",CHN
Every man has the right to make his future strong. to take such actions that can secure his future. in the cut throat competition of two days world everyone is struggling for the betterment of his or her self. There are so many problems in our country that has become a constant source of worry for our citizens. One of the problems is price hike and insufficient salaries of the people. In Pakistan there is a growing trend of part time job. The point is thinking that from where trend has stared. Now days in Pakistan it become hard to earn bread and butter by single person with such a low salary. Govt. of Pakistan is unaware of that problem. the salaries of people are not so sufficient of support their families. hence for support they go for the second option i. e. part time job. But it becomes so difficult to manage because usually one can give full attention to only one job at a time. It is so heart touching to see the students doing part time job to sport their studies. Govt. should have to take notice of this situation. part time job is not as bad as it seems. It depends on the purpose for which you are doing so. it is totally prohibited for students because they can affect their studies by doing so. But if you are doing that to take experience or to support your nation then well and good. in short part time job has become a kind of necessity for people. They want to give better future to their families and it cannot be possible with low salaries that the Govt. is giving. so they should have adopt a side business or part time job. Perhaps it has its own advantages and disadvantages but they vary from person to person and their purpose of doing so.,PAK
"Smoking is not good. Cigarettes are a drug. Cigarettes are bad for our body. But we still smoke cigarettes because Cigarettes are addictive. My father smoke. Heavily and I hate my father smoke heavily. My friends smoke, too. I wish they don't take a cigarette. Cigarette is known is not good in the world. People know Cigarettes is not good. But people cannot seem to quit. The Smoker is addictive. Lots of people are getting cancer cause of it. We must warn everyone how serious smoking is and we must help them stop. It's been years since I heard that the government has raised the price of cigarettes. But they didn't raise it to make people stop. They did it to earn more profits. I mean why did they only raise 500won if they intended to make people stop smoking? They should have risen more and more. But there's one problem. If this policy really works, and no one buys a cigarette, Korea will get a big damage. Almost more than 5 percent of budget is earned by cigarettes. But if this stops, all of us could get in trouble. So it will be impossible to make them stop selling cigarettes.",KOR
"I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many benefits to having one. It not only acts as a source for extra pocket money but also helps students to better manage time. In addition, the student will be exposed to many new experiences that can only be achieved by working that particular job. For example, the student could get a job as a customer service officer and learn how to effectively deal with angry customers or discover their passion for this occupation. The latter would be extremely useful for college students who are unclear about their future career. Moreover, a part-time job would be useful for college students as they build up networks or forge new friendships. For instance, working in an events job, where most of them consists of mainly students, allows for one to know more people from different backgrounds or schools. However, a college student should also take note not to over-work and neglect their studies as being a student should be considered their full time job. Lastly, if college students feel that they are easily stress and are definitely not able to commit to both studies and working at the same time are better off without a part-time job as well. ",SIN
"Having a part-time job is one of the best things college students do to help prepare themselves for their futures. It is well known that students to graduate from college with no work experience have an extremely tough time finding employment, and along with this, the employment which they can find is not as lucrative or as engaging as a work that can be found if they only had some work experience. Almost everyone in the world will have to work at some point in their lives, so why not get started as early as possible. I do think that college students should focus most of their time on learning, but it is very easy to find a place that will allow you to work with a flexible schedule so that you can stay focused on your studies. Furthermore, if you're like me and have been going to school for a long time or are pursuing an advanced degree, you will inevitably have to work in order to make enough money to live and eat. Except for a few rare cases of kids that have extremely wealthy parents, most students will need to work in order to support either their living situation or their entertainment.",ENS
"I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan and I have many reasons for this opinion. First, I think that smoking is very dirty and is very bad for all the people who do it. It would be a nice gift to smokers to give them a good motivation an opportunity to quit smoking, as people who smoke often have a very difficult time quitting on their own due to the addictive effects of nicotine and other chemicals contained within cigarettes. Next, it is not fair to nonsmokers to have to eat in a restaurant that is filled with cigarette smoke because they have to breathe that in and it is worse for their health than it is for the smokers. Secondhand smoke really can kill people, and I did have one friend who grew up in a household in which his parents smoked very heavily, and he had health problems for a long time. Once he moved out of that house, he became much more healthy and vibrant. Smoking is bad for you no matter where you are in the world, so I think that Japan should ban smoking at the restaurants in the same way that the U. S. is beginning to ban smoking at the restaurants here too.",ENS
"I think smoking is really a bad habit to be having. I have always hated the smell of smoke and detested walking behind people who were smoking as being a Singaporean student, we have always learnt about the negatives of being a passive smoker. More importantly, I feel very sad for each and every smoker was I walk pass them. I really hope that they would stop smoking as it is really harmful to their bodies. On top of them, they are unknowingly hurting everyone around them by making them passive smokers, or polluting the air. I hated it when I found out that my friends were smoking. I told them to stop but till today, I am not truly sure if they have stopped smoking. I really wish that they did. I do not see any positive about smoking actually, it wastes money as they are in fact really expensive and it does harm. I sincerely hope that in the future, less and less people will be smoking cigarettes. My father used to be a smoker according to my mother when he was in his younger days. Thankfully he stopped smoking before my parents got married. Since my father could stop in the past with no forms of rehabilitation of stop smoking campaigns, I feel that this generation smokers should have it easier by finding help to stop smoking. ""If there is a will, there is a way"" as quoted, hence I feel that it is important for us to all to continually encourage our love ones to stop smoking. ",SIN

"Nowadays, there's a growing trend for college students to have a part-time job, such as tutors, waitress, teacher assistants, etc. Some people think it is good for students to have some practical experiences through a part-time job, while others argue it's purely waste of time. However, the question whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job is quite controversial, at least to me. There are certain advantages for a part-time job. As is so often been emphasized, practical experience should be applied to theoretical knowledge we've learned on the class. Having a part-time is an ideal method to increase one's practical skills and expand social network during the college. Besides, a part-time job can be a stimulus for students to study harder. Through working, one may find what he lacks when comparing to a experienced employee. Thus, in order to have a better career after graduation, he may have a solitude goal to his study and achieve greater progress. Moreover, students who have a part-time job may become independent earlier than those who don't, for they may obtain a clear view of money through earning it by their own. But the disadvantages should not be neglected. Having a part-time job may occupy too much time, which leaves little for one to do his study. Instead of acting as a stimulus, in this case the part-time job becomes a obstacle. Such cases should be taken into consideration since it happens all the time when there's a big project in the work for you to conduct. The lack of the ability of time management can make the situation even worse. In conclusion, whether a part-time job is important to a student depend on the attribution of the job as well as the ability of the student. There's no easy way to answer the question",CHN
"Books, clothes, cosmetics, food, outing all things what a college student faces have something to do with the money. In that case, more and more college students tend to find a part-time job so as to pay for their rising expenses. As far as I can see, the importance of having a part-time job is more than that, since it can bring many benefits to us. Helping students to acquire the ability of management is one of the profits. College students are used to such things as asking parents for allowance or buy whatever they like regardless of money. When they are out of money, it's time for them to beg parents for some again. Having a part-time job will help students to learn the difficulty and uneasiness of work, thus to understand the precious of the money earned by parents, which enables college students to have some ideas about money management, for example, think twice before spending. Another advantage of doing a part-time job is that it provides students a perfect situation to practice and enhance personal skills. Whatever job you do, tutor, waiter (waitress), salesperson the ability of communication and social functions will be greatly improved. Last but not least, having a part-time job is a good experience to students who are stepping into the society later on, for it offers an opportunity to apply what you learn, no matter your knowledge or social skills, to reality. You can find if it works and discover the shortcomings of your own, in order to better improve and understand yourself. In a nutshell, a part-time job is a lot more than just having some extra income, college students can attain quite a number of benefits, which can ensure them not only a more comfortable current life, but also a promising future.",CHN
"Should Smoking be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country? What do you think about it? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only at the restaurants but also in all public places where have many people such as in church, libraries, kid's play ground, museums, theaters, etc. Because it is not good for the smokers' health and people that surround them. Why is Smoking so bad for the smokers' health and people that surround them? It is because I known that in cigarettes, there is second hand smoke that contains all of the toxins. There are so many diseases that happen to smoker and people that smell smoke it. They include heart disease, pregnancy complications and the well know disease, cancer. The Carbon in a cigarette is extremely dangerous too. The Carbon binds with the Hemoglobin in the blood stream. When that happens, the Hemoglobin will not allow the red blood cells to carry and transport oxygen throughout the human body. Nicotine, it damages your brain right after you first smoke by opening up the receptors in it. When you sleep at night the Nicotine level drops very low and that is the reason people usually reach for a cigarette right after they wake up. So I consider that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country and other public places too.",THA

"I don't think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I also don't think that smoking should be banned all the restaurants in the U.

The best way to solve this problem is simply to have a smoking section and a nonsmoking section in every restaurant. This is very easy to accomplish and should not cost the restaurants too much money to put into place. If they can do this, both smokers and non-smokers can have a good time at any restaurants and not have to worry about the other people. Smokers are inconvenienced just as much by not being able to smoke in restaurants as nonsmokers feel they are when smokers smoke in restaurants.

"Smoking is absolutely one of the devious behaviors, especially the problems it caused within teenagers. We can hear the news about smoking-caused problems among world's teenagers through public media. There are 2 reasons for its rampancy, one of which is its spectacular profit. The other one is that people who once expose to smoking, they would be addicted to it easily. Only when the deep-seated causes are removed can the smoking problems be solved. Authorities should reinforce the security at the Customs so as to cut off the resource of tobacco and cigarette which are usually smuggled. Furthermore, the authorities ought not to only put smugglers into jail but ask them for the clue for the purpose of tracking down the actual instigator. When the toughest problems are solved, it's a lot easier to stop the vice in schools and society. There are several action should be taken. First, governments should enforce harsher law against those deliberate law breakers. Then, schools needs to carry out brainwash correctly, and channel students where is the right way to go. The last, rehabilitation centers are essential to be set up since we can help those devious teenagers recovering from the pathological addiction.

Even though they were kind of young when they died, the last years of their life was very bad and they did not have a very high quality of life.

I don't think that tobacco companies are doing a good enough job of explaining the harmful side effects of their products, and I don't think that governments are doing enough to restrict usage of tobacco in public places.

Their co-circular activities also need more income. In school life students feel themselves dependent on their parents but in college life the student wants to become independent.

"A part time job is great for students still studying in high schools or even college, as this reduces their dependence on their parents as well as achieving financial independence. This also has the benefit of reducing the financial burden of the parents, or even help supplement the family income. By working part time, students can also feel financial freedom, and even learn how to budget early on in life. However, some people may recklessly spend their new found income, and continue to do so in increasing amounts later on in life. This may lead to debt when the person starts overspending or taking on credit loans. Besides earning extra income, a part time job is also useful to gain working experience. This will allow the student gain an upper hand when looking for a full time, permanent job. Another positive side effect of working part time could be the new social connections one could make whilst working. By networking this early in life, many opportunities could arise for the part timer, and sometimes even go on to open up a career path for him or her. However, there are also downsides to working part time. Working part time greatly decreases the amount of spare time one could have for relaxation and play. If overworked, one could neglect their other important parts of their lives like bonding with their friends and family. Over time, this could lead to the person not having a fulfilling, balanced life, causing depression in severe cases. All in all, I still believe that every student should get part time jobs, so as to broaden their horizons and also to make extra cash for future needs or even for indulgence. However, one should also not neglect their social life while working. ",SIN

"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students often have schedules that afford them a few spare hours every day. Assuming a student has five hours of lessons every day, this leaves a large part of the late afternoon and evening free for them to work part-time. By working, students enable themselves to earn an income to sustain themselves, so they do not have to depend on handouts from their parents. Apart from cultivating their independence, a part-time job might possibly also allow students to have disposable income. If a student is prudent with the extra money that comes from a part-time job, he or she can finance overseas trips or plough this sum of money into investments. Furthermore, students ensure that their time is nicely occupied. Working provides them with the impetus to take stock of their time properly. After all, when a student knows that he/she still has assignments to hand in and projects to complete after his/her work, there is less chance of him/her slacking off on his/her academic commitments. More importantly, part-time work provides a student with life experience--- something that is not easily attainable from merely reading books. The interactions that students glean from their work experience will stand them in good stead when it is time for them to enter the workforce as fulltime employees. While a part-time job might lead to less personal time for a college student, this need not be a bad thing altogether. By managing their time wisely, having a part-time job for college students need not be an onerous commitment. Indeed, many college students around the world can attest to the fact that part-time work can have financial and socio-emotional benefits. ",SIN

And for myself, I will do a part-time job if I have free time after study at the university because I want to find some money for use daily and I want to find new friends that do a part-time job before me.

"I disagree. If students spend a lot of their time working then that is going to cut into the time that they should be spending on their studies. There may also be travel time lost going backwards and forwards and unless the job is relevant to their future careers it will not be useful work experience. Usually, college students are working part-time jobs for the money and this is OK of course. Some students may come from affluent families and might not need the cash. If the latter is the case then it really isn't too important that they have a part-time job. The only time that they need bother with work if at all, is maybe to serve an internship somewhere. College is for study and I believe that is what students should be spending their time on mostly so they have a chance at graduating with solid scores. Being involved with anything else is only going to take them away from their main study goals. Some leisure time is fine because it gives them a chance to unwind a bit and take their mind off things.

"As a number of employers from companies point out, hardly do college graduates know how to work efficiently, simply because what they learn from universities cannot be applied to their career. So as far as I'm concerned, it is of great importance for college students to have a part-time job. First and foremost, every college student will start a career in a foreseeable future, thus taking an early step in the job fields can help them adjust to a reserve life that is totally different from school days. For instance, we'll see our supervisors work and get to know how they handle their projects and how they deal with people, and that's what we are never supposed to grasp from lectures or seminars in colleges. Those working experiences can benefit college students when they start their own careers. Also, part-time jobs enrich college students' lives during their spare time. College students tend to have fewer classes and more free time than high school students. However, it has been a common phenomenon that the precious free time is wasted on chatting or playing meaningless video games. What a pity! So why don't we make full use of this golden opportunity and applying for a part-time job? That won't bore us at least, and we can have a sense of achievement via serving other people. Finally, part-time jobs can offer college students with a sum of salary, which can be attractive to those who still depend on parents economically. Technically, college students are all adults, whose parents no longer bear the responsibility to support them with pocket money. So they should earn money by themselves, pay for their tuitions and the cost of living, and most importantly to ease the burden of their parents. In conclusion, as stated above, part-time jobs provide college students with working experience and money in need. Considering all these advantages, isn't it a wise idea for college students to have a part-time job?",CHN
"I agree with the topic that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because all the college students need to know how difficult it is to earn money, and this kind of experience can also be a reference that helps those people to know what they are lacking of; thus they may do jobs more smoothly in the near future. The average age when Taiwan college students graduate is 22; some of the students will keep learning in graduate school, and thus when they eventually finish their degrees, they are almost 25 years old. This phenomenon means that most of the parents in Taiwan need to support their children until they are 22~25. Due to the concept of an old Chinese idiom phrase ""Every thing is lower than study"", Parents in Taiwan want their children to study more (especially than other people) to find good jobs (generally means to do job inside the office with air conditioner rather than work outside under the sun. ) Therefore, most of the students often get money from their parents without any effort; when they finally graduate, most of them want the job that is easy, paid a lot, and that working place must be near home. However, the real situation is cruel in the society; those graduate students are actually the freshmen of the big society and need to learn a lot what the school did not (or could not)teach them. Thus, I think to get a part-time job when they are still students can be a kind of pre-learning of entering the society. During the process of earning money, they will understand how difficult to support them to live; in Taiwan the average salary of an hour's effort is 95 NT dollars, so if they do fifty hours a month, they will get 4750 NT dollars. However, the average cost of a meal in Taiwan is 50NT dollars; that is, they need at least 4500NT dollars for them to use on eating. Obviously it is really hard to live by themselves only; not to mention the cost of school fees, textbooks, and house renting. When they finally find out that actually money is really hard to earn, they start to grow up and think more about their plans of their future. Of course they can get some useful experience during doing the part-time jobs such as learning how to understand others' feeling and thinking especially of bosses and customers-which is the most important of all in the world of working. Therefore, to have a part-time job is indeed important for college students because it will help them understand how difficult to earn money is, and thus be more harmonious when entering the world of working because they have already known that there are still a lot for them to learn, and thus help them to work smoothly.",TWN
"In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. When I was a child, my parents told me that what I did after class should not just all about class. I should do something special and different to realize the world. They said that you won't be a student forever. You should learn something useful for your future life. The reasons why I agree that having a part-time job for college students is important are following below. First of all, my parents said that our life can't only study so having a part-time job is a great way of not just studying. Besides, someone having a part-time job can earn money. It's a way for students to earn money on their own. They can learn how to take use of their money. The last one is that when we have a part-time job, we can make friends with more people. You can learn many things from them by chatting, and learn more about the social. I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. It's a great way to know more about the social. By the way, though I think having a part-time job is important, I still don't want to see that students give up their school works.",TWN
"There are many opportunities for university students to earn money. Having a part-time job is one of the ways. Although it can help students to earn money real quick, is it really important for university students to get a part-time job? I will say that it's not. There are two reasons underlying my claim. First, university students are supposed to be full-time students so that students should anticipate most of their time in studies and put studying in their highest priority. Thus, the workload is always demanding throughout their studies. However, part-time jobs occupy a lot of time, say 20 to 30 hours a week. Students may not have enough time to finish the work given in their university studies. As a result, they may resort to skip lessons or even copying from the others in order to finish the work. This will adversely affect the students' study behaviour. Therefore, getting part-time jobs is not important, or even it's not good for students. Second, some university students may not get enough experience in working outside. Before working in the real industry, there are some programs that equip university students to be able to work outside such as industrial training, internship program, and so on. These programs provide assistance at all times if you encounter any problems on your work. However, if students do not participate in such programs, they may find it difficult to adapt into part-time jobs since they have to do most of the work by themselves and have full responsibility for their work. They would become stressful as they are struggled to fulfill the requirements in the part-time jobs. Therefore, part-time jobs are not a good way to get working experience and hence it's not important for students.",HKG
" In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public places. No mattter what reason you may possess, no matter how willing you are for smoking at that moment you are in the public place, as a result, you can not smoking there. On one hand, smoking in public places is an unmoral behaviour. As we all know, there are usually many people in public places. And I suppose there are lots of people hate somebody who smokes in public places, not only for the places not belong to his or her only, but also for the healthy environment. The smoking activies actully seriously injure the smokers' organs especially for that lung, says the statistics from the WHO, there is more than one third people died in lung cancer simply caused by that smoking. Not only the people who smokes suffer this disease, but also the people who breathe the bad air--the smoke, will face the danger of catching the lung disease. What is more, the smoke coming from the cigarettes is bad for the environment. And it is linked to the greenhouse effect to some degree. We all need a better place to live in, so forbidding smoking in public places is a way of protecting our environment. In the end, I still say that smoking absolutely should be banned in public places without doubt, not only for the smokers' health, but the publics', and to be more, for a more confortable life, a cleaner sky, an enjoyable air. a more beautiful earth.",CHN
"I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Japan. Smoking has good points and also bad points. Of course, you can get a pleasure, and have a relax when you smoke. I don't know how I feel when I smoke, because I don't smoke. However, at the same time, you get harm your lung and people next to you. When a non-smoker breath smoke, he get harm more seriously than smoker breath smoke. You damage other people unconsciously. If you are in your house, you can smoke without any anxiety. But if you are in a restaurant, you should not have a smoke because there are many people around you. Someone may say it is a pity for smokers that smoking is banned at all restaurants in Japan. Of course, today, smoking is banned at many places. For example, you must not smoke at many stations, department stores, buildings. If all restaurants become banned places for smoking, smokers can't get a pleasure by smoking in Japan. However, you should not harm other people by smoking. If someone dead because you smoke, how you take the responsibility of his death? Therefore smokers should go out from a restaurant if you want to smoke, or find other ways how get a pleasure.",JPN
"Smoking has been a popular means of feeling good among many people today. Often if not, people get used to smoking in almost an place they go to. This includes public places, such as restaurants. Smoking people tend to forget about the other people around them. They tend to be apathetic to the reactions of others towards such an act. Sometimes, they don't understand that the people around them vary in age, and therefore somehow allow the elderly, and even the youngest of children (including infants or babies) to do indirect second-hand smoking. This has been a common conflict among many in public places, restaurants in particular. While people are happily eating out with their families, or even the whole clan, still others prefer to smoke. This should not be. These people do not have the right to disrupt the happiness and meriment of hungry people and families around them, causing to ultimately hurting them indirectly as well. Smokers do not understand that others lose their appetite in food places, once exposed to hazardous chemicals. This is why smoking in public places, namely restaurants, should be banned. If the managers cannot simply abolish the act in their restaurants, then these managers should at least be responsible enough to create a'smoking area. ' Even a tiny space would suffice for the damage smokers unintentionally commit.",PHL
"Students do part time job for fulfilling their necessary requirments like education, necessary needs ect. If parents are not able the fee of children then the students are doing part time jobs. The trend doing part time jobs is popular in foreign countries because studies are expensive in foreign countries and parents are not able to pay the fee of children. If foreign countries students went to their college at first time and do part time jobs at 2nd time to fulfill their requirements. Students do part time jobs because of poverty and to help out their parents but it effects their health and make them week. They don't eat food at time which causes bad effect to their health. In Pakistan this trend is so popular but due to poverty students do part time job. So, the government of Pakistan and the foreign governments should have to do the fee concession for the poor students to make them well educated and make their society a well educated society. So, if students stops doing part time jobs they become healthy and well educated. Government should have to do concession for making their society healthy and well educated. Students should stopped part time jobs if fee concession are made by government.",PAK

Part-time job is getting popular today. Many students want to get part-time job for money. Some want to work for experience. The last vacation my friends worked in one restaurant. They work for experience, friendship and a little money. They wanted me to do it too but I can't go to work with them because I have to work for my family business. For me I think part-time job is interesting but I don't want to do it. I want to do the best for my study. I think part-time job will use a lot of time. I want to use that time for my extra studies and read more books and many free time activities. If I use my free time for part-time job, I think my grade will be worse than do not have job. Only study in my faculty is too hard and very tired. Everyone must read a lot and remember all of the knowledge that we had learnt. So I had no time for part-time job.",THA
"I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is known by many people that smoking is bad not only for smokers' health, but also health of people around the smoker. This is truth which is proved scientifically. These days, smoking is banned at many public places. Restaurants is also visited by many people and they enjoy eating. No smoking people have the right to keep their health. Moreover, some of them hate the smell of tobacco and mere smell of it makes their feelings bad. Even if no smoking seats and smoking seats are separated at the restraint, it is difficult to shat out the smell completely. In this situation, people who dislikes tobacco cannot enjoy eating at the restaurant. On the other hand, it is not necessary for smokers to smoke when they are eating. If they want to smoke, they have many other ways. They can smoke before their eating at other places. Smokers only have to stand to smoke at eating so that this problem will be solved. Every people can eat at restaurants without unpleasure if Smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",JPN
"Well if you do then you will regret it later because not only will you possibly die but along with that you won t be very pretty. Now today a lot of girls and boys in their teens smoke now you may think so what but 5, 000 are under 18 and that means they could be 12 or going to the extreme 9. Now you don t have to have a cigarette in your hand to be smoking, if your parents smoke you get second hand smoke which is technically the same thing because you are still inhaling smoke actually even more. So now that you know a little of how smoking then here is a lot more. What I meant by if you start smoking then you won t be very pretty is not if you smoke for one day it s if you smoke for 10 to 36 years. Do you think that Julie Andrews got her wrinkles for smoking? NO SHE DIDN'T! Her wrinkles came from age and wrinkles from smoking are a big difference. Because wrinkles from age are well from age, but wrinkles from smoking are because the tobacco settles in your sink. Think of it this way your thirty and you wrinkles ALL over that would be because you smoke. Or maybe your 65 or 75 then your wrinkles are ok So as you can see smoking is bad for you, your health and your appearance. And this is just some things that can happen.

"Components creating problem are source of hindrance smoking is the same thing. It is a way of spoilage and wastage of youth. Through many effect have been done to stop it yet it is increasing rapidly. It has taken the whole world. A thing is always adopted rapidly. Now days a new problem of smoking has appeared. It is that smoking at restaurants. Restaurant is considered peaceful places. Smoking there is very immoral and against law. It not only creates a unhealthy atmosphere but also disturb other. Smoking at restaurants is a situation which creates disturbance and hatred among public. We should consider that anything natural must not be destroyed. Restaurant is a place favorable to human nature. It must not be spoiled. Moreover, steps should be taken both at individual and public level to stop this problem. Government should make rules and regulations concerning this problem. It is an important issue both regarding health and mind peace. No one should be allowed to smoke in restaurant. It is our obligation to consider rights of others and give importance to them. As human beings we must feel for others and should not do anything which disturbs others.",PAK
"I agree with the statement that ""It is important for college students to have a part-time job"" because nowadays Thai college students don't know the value of money. Moreover, some families are poor or don't have enough money to spend for everything. Sometimes, studying in the university maybe use a lot of money such as, for eating, doing many activities, buy many things for use in daily life etc. so, college students should do a part-time job for support themselves. I think that, doing a part-time job is a good idea. It is useful because the college students has much leisure time and don't anything to do and they can earn money for use in daily life too. Sometimes, they want to earn money for use in anything that they want. When they want to spend money, they won't borrow another person and will decrease some debts. Furthermore, they will get many experiences and get much knowledge to use in their life. They can support themselves and can survive in the society. College students will be proud themselves that can success in a part-time job. Their parents will be proud in their children too and it is important that it can decrease the tasks of their parents. A part-time job is using the free time to be useful and can help the college students to know the value of money and the value of themselves. So I really strongly agree that It is important for college students to have a part-time job.",THA
"Smoking is an addiction. A person who fall prey to smoking cannot get out of it. Smoking is bad habit and it should be banned by not giving advertisement in news papers. Smoking should be banned in all places but as the topic is about restaurants so, smoking should be banned in restaurants. The people sitting in restaurant try to adopt the lifestyle of other people. Children and youth follow the lifestyle of other people as they are growing stage. As the man is affected by his environment. So, if smoking is done in front of the innocent people they try to follow it and falls prey to it and never become successful in their future. One of the reason to ban smoking in restaurant is to save innocent children from smoking. The other reason is that smoking is injurious to health. The people sitting in restaurant are also affect by the smoking through they are not smoking. So, through the mistake is of one but the whole people in the restaurant are affect by this bad habit.

"I agree the argument that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. College students should share their parents' burden because the tuition is too high by doing part time job. They can be motivated to save money after difficult experience for earning money. Lastly, they can learn many useful things. Here are some reasons for this statement. First of all, in Korea, due to the high rate of tuition students have to share their parents' burdensome by doing a part time job. Korea is one of the countries which have most expensive tuition. To cut family's economic problem, students can try to earn their allowance from payment of part time job. Second, most college students do not know how hard earning money is because they are familiar with getting money from their parents. Through new experience of part time job, they can recognize thanks for parents. Lastly, from part time job, students can learn a lot of useful information. For example, they can learn the way of patience when they feel angry and the importance of keeping kind and polite attitude in social relationship. For those reasons, I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job. In Korean situation, they should share economic burden and they can learn many useful things from doing part time job.",KOR
"I agree with this opinion. At first, smoking is harmful for people. Passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking. So smokers bother many non-smokers. Secondly, the smell of tobacco is very strong. And once clothes absorb the smell, it is difficult to remove the smell. It is an offensive smell for non-smokers. When I went a restaurant and sat down smoking seats, my clothes absorb the smell in spite of nobody smoking. The other day, I had another terrible experience. I sat down no-smoking seats, but smoke came from smoking seats. And I felt very bad. Smoke spoiled dishes and clothes. I went back home and wash my clothes immediately. It was very unfortunate day. Regardless of the separation of smoking seats and no smoking seats, smoke bothers people. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. There is no merit of smoking. Smoke spoils tastes of foods. Cook don't want this result. In order to enjoy meals, smoking should be banned. I don't understand significance of smoking. Do smokers smoke for relaxation? It is better to find an alternative way of relaxation. Nobody benefits from smoking. Smoking should be banned at not only restaurant but also all public space in Japan.",JPN
"From many campaigns of the government to decrease smoking, it is clear that smoking is not accepted by the majority because there is no one could step out and persuade everyone to smoke. In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned especially in restaurants. Personally, I can say that I am one person who does hate smoking because it could drive me mad and annoyed every single time I smell it. Imagine the restaurant's atmosphere, there should be quiet, neat, smell good, and beautiful, but these senses will be kicked away if the smell of smoking comes. So, I cannot see any point of allowance to smoke in restaurants. People come to restaurants in order to eat, listen to beautiful music, and have a good time with family, friends, or lover, not to smell the smoking. In my opinion, those restaurant who allow smoking would discredit themselves because people would consider that restaurant dirty and low quality. Nevertheless, smoking would not only destroy your health, but either other people around you. Moreover, smoking would make your image negative especially women, because social often hope that women should be modest. So, smoking should be banned at all in restaurants because it could not bring anyone's happiness.",THA
"As with my last response, I feel that it is much easier to rely on numbers than it is to make qualitative arguments that have no real basis. I have to admit that I am not as well educated on the subject of smoking and I have not recently read any news about the subject, but I would venture to say that an overwhelming majority of people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants. That's it. No more discussion. We live in a democratic society, and I am not sure if Japan as a democratic society as well, but if the majority of people there think smoking should be banned in restaurants too, then they should just do it. By living in a democratic society, we have agreed to support the idea that the majority rules. One thing that makes this difficult, however, is that most democratic societies also put a strong emphasis on freedom of speech and action.

"Having a par time job was not easy because at the same time you are a college student. If I am not mistaken there is a time that you forgot what you should do as student like your assignment, report, project, reviewing etc., there is a lack of time if you are going to study at the same time working. Their is also a time that a working student will not have any more interest to study but they rather choose to work because according to them is nice to earn money compare to study for a long year. It is really nice to be a working student because It has an advantage to yourself like you will earn money for you to be able to buy thing that you want, save for the future, pay the expenses you have, help to pay for your tuition fee and it will increase your self esteem. It also help you to build relevant skill and multi tasking skill. Having a part time job help you to feel a sense of dignity and worth. On my own opinion I thing par time job is for student who are more competitive and very flexible in works. And I find it more challenging for the working student to compete in school activities.

" China has a large number of smokers. Many young boys and girls have the habit of smoking; some of them are middle school students. Even plenty of smokers have stepped into the restaurants. Most of nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon and the same to me. I hold the view that smoking should be banned especial at the restaurants. I clearly know that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to our health More and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. Admittedly, the smokers want to eliminate their pressure and relax themselves. Hanging a cigarette at the corner of the mouth makes them feel right and sure. The key to issues is they should not hurt other's feeling, while smokers should not pollute the clean air at the restaurants and do harm to others. Second-hand smoke is almost as medically hazardous to exposed non-smokers as it is to the smoker. All in all, I strongly advocate banning smoking in public. Not only is it good for the smokers themselves but also do their great contribution to our human being and our green world.",CHN
"Being a college student means being independent and responsible in life. There are things that you need to start considering particularly your money or allowance. There are college students who are being supported by their parents financially but that is not the case because as a college student we must support our own needs or wants and start looking and have a part-time job. There maybe college students who don't want to work because they are still young or they are being shy but what they don't know is that having a part-time job is not just a source of extra allowance but it will also prepare you in the future after you graduate. If we have part-time job buying things we want won't be that hard anymore or we don't have to ask our parents to buy us some things. Also having a part-time job you'll learn how to budget and manage your allowance because it is your hard earned money. No matter if our parents gave us allowance it is best if we still have a part-time job because we cannot say if it is enough but if we have one we can still support whatever our needs in case we our short in budget.

"Everybody knows that smoking is bad to our health, but there are still a lot of people smoking. Smoking does our lung harm. Seriously, it may cause lung cancer. Except for hurting smoking people, it still hurts those who don't smoke but breathe too much smoke into their lung. If a mother-to-be smokes, she may hurt her baby's health. So, to avoid hurting our health, smoking people should try to quit it. Now there is a kind of candy which is made of the same ingredient, but it includes little of it. When you want to smoke, you just have it so that you still can have the same sense of satisfaction without smoking. Besides, you can try to reduce the times of smoking. Everyday you decrease the times of smoking so that you would quit it slowly. Take my father for example. He smokes for more than twenty years. However, he still quits it successfully. To many people, quitting smoking is difficult for them. But, if you determined to do, actually it is not as difficult as you imagine. Do you smoke? If your answer is ""yes"", then quit it now!

"As the saying goes, when we enter the college, this means that we are entering the society. So when we are in the college, not only we should learn knowledge, but also we should take part-time jobs. In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons. Firstly, we go to school to gain knowledge, but we seldom have the chance to put it into practice. But in the college, we have our own time, we meet more people, then we have more chances. So having a part-time job makes it possible to put what we have learned into practice. Secondly, taking a part-time job is a way to experience our life. It can tell us we are not children any more. We should do things on our own. Thirdly, we can accumulate social experience and learn more social knowledge to make ourselves more quickly to adapt to the future society. What's more, we can add a little to our cost of living. In addition, when we find a job, we should be careful in case of being treated. Above all, I think it is important for college students to take a part-time job.",CHN
"Yes, smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants in the country. For Singapore's case, there have been designated areas outside of the restaurants for patrons who smoke. Whoever, I believe more can be done. By having smoking areas outside of the restaurants, other passersby may be affected by the fumes from these patrons. Thus, I believe there should be an elimination of smoking anywhere around the premises so that all patrons can enjoy fresh and clean air no matter where they seat. Some restaurants such as PS Cafe at Dempsey have designated their smoking area at the top of their building but I believe that patrons who may want to have a good view of the city may be affected by these smokers. Second hand smoke is one of the causes of cancer, which has been reiterated time and again. Thus, an absolute abolishment should deter people from picking this unhealthy habit. By not allowing restaurants to have any form of smoking will eventually give these patrons a reason to kick the habit so as to socialize with their compatriots. And so, I believe that Singapore is on the right track to banning smoking at all restaurants but more could be done. Perhaps in the new future when smoking has been eradicated, everyone will have a wonderful dining experience. ",SIN
"I somewhat agree with this. It's has both Pros and Cons to have a part time job. First I'll explain the good thing to have a part time job. I think most of student has problem about saving money.

When they finish class instead surfing the Internet, having a part time job. 2. It may help they learn new experience and skill of life for living in now and future. 3.

Moreover, smoking will make you have bad personality and not good for the children in the society. All adults should give good thing to the children. Stop smoking can make the world have fresh air, you will have good looking; don't make any trouble to the others. It is a good chance to stop smoking because it not has benefit with you but it is more advantage with another in the society too. If you not or stop smoking everyone in the society will live with happiness and get the best life.",THA
"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of smokers in recent years. However, smoking is gradually being forbidden in more and more public places. Restaurants, under this circumstance, become most common places for smokers. Actually, some advanced restaurants have already taken measures to prevent people from smoking while having meals. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking does harm both to the smoker himself and people in the neighborhood. It is common sense that smoking is the cause of a series of severe diseases including the lung cancer. What's more, some people around the smoker may be allergic to the smog, which can lead to the unpredictable consequences. On the contrary, if a restaurant is free of the released smog, the air around will be clear enough to enable the people inside to refresh themselves. Furthermore, banning of smoking can largely decrease the possibility of fire. As is known to us all that the kitchen in a restaurant is full of lampblack in most times, which makes it easier to catch fire than in other places. So no smoking means that the security of the people in the restaurant will be better assured. Last but not least, if only some restaurants prohibit smoking while others don't, a phenomenon will emerge that a number of smoker will chooses to eat in a small restaurant where smoking is allowed. This will cause the increasingly worse of the environment in those small restaurants. To conclude, smoking has a bad effect not only on people's health, but also on the environment. Therefore, I hold the opinion that at all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned.",HKG

"I have two opinions of this Topic. And this opinion divided two part of view point. That is, an economic point of view and social point of view. First. Nowadays, College tuition is more expensive than others. So it is a burden to many students and parents who have no money or ordinary people. For this reason. Student should work for making money of college tuition. If students make money for tuition, it will reduce a burden for college tuition. Or students need to make a pocket money. Because, college students is an adult. Now, they need to time of economic independence. And they no more get the money for there's parent. Second. To have a part-time job is indirect experience of social life before we join in society. For this experience, we learned that earning money is very hard and difficult what I experienced before. And we will experience human relationship of social life. In this society, lots of people who have diversity are existed in our society. Through this we can learn how to handle these people who have diversity. And meeting in the diverse people, we can learn development of relationship in the social life. To conclude, to have a part time of job is giving a many experience before join in society",KOR
"Part-time jobs are invaluable in helping college students know what it is that they want to do later in life. In our current education system in Singapore, students just take the same subjects even if they don't really like it because that is the way it works to get to the university or Polytechnic. So the problem is that they are likely to get lost when choosing a course, and even after choosing a course to study, they are unlikely to be passionate about their future career because they have no idea what it is like to work in the industry unless they have taken internships or part-time jobs. That said, part-time jobs can be done during term time but few internships really can be done in term time. Part-time jobs taken during term time complements internships done during holidays to give students a good look at how the working world runs and what they really want to do later on after they graduate. Another use of part-time jobs is to learn skills. Some relevant skills are like time management and job-specfic understanding and hands-on administrative skill. These skills are actually what makes a person fit in well at work after he graduates from college. This leads people with part-time work experience to feel more confident going to work in the industry and even helps in clearing interviews as the person is able to demonstrate that he or she has what it takes to succeed besides just academic knowledge.

"I agree. I realize that a lot of people will disagree with me, but I feel that students who have part-time jobs usually work better with their degree studies. Perhaps it is because they are normally more organized than some of their mates or they have just gotten into sound routines when it comes to balancing work with study. Some just couldn't be bothered working anyway, because they just want to cruise through their degrees and have parties every day. Nothing wrong with that, if they pass, but I think the ones that I have seen who are also working, seem to take their studies more seriously and dread the thought that they might even fail one subject. I am not saying that this is true for all students, it is just my opinion based on the comparisons that I have made between different categories of students who I happen to know personally. Another thing that struck me was that there course averages seemed to be slightly higher not for any one particular subject but generally speaking over the course of their degrees. I also think that for a lot of students these days, they understand what is happening in the world, the economy, the job market and they know that if the want to get anywhere in life, they are going to have to work for it.",ENS
"I never conceal my disgust at smoking. On my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in the whole universe, much less in public places. It is well-acknowleged that smokers are doing something relaxing at the expense of their healthâ€”â€”even their families'. Everybody knows that smoking hurts lung, but in fact, it almost affects the whole body, greatly increasing the possibility of heart attacks and causing deafness, enteron deseases even cancers. What's worse, smokers will finally develop a denpendency on nicotine and become its slaves forever. Typical heavy smoker as my father is, he uses cigarettes to relieve his tiredness. And in turn, he will becom extremely upset and tired once a cigarette couldn't be smoked. That's why smokers always fail to give up smoking, knowing every disadvantages it brings. Smoking in public places just enlarges a personal problem and affect more people. Everyone smokes passively, everyone get unhappy and people's rights is torted. As far as I'm concerned, smoking in public places is not only a kind of immoral, a kind of disgrace, but also a kind of disobeying the spirit of law. I just feel terrible and can't help starting to cough when it comes that somebody standing by me is smoking. There're so many problems it is causing and why any of us should accept being affected by it? Allowing smoking in public places may also convey an attitutude that smoking is somehow be allowed, be admitted, and be understood. Smokers cannot feel the criticism from the society or even a little limit which would makes it even harder to for them to stop it. Undoultedly, apart from people don't smoke, it's also unfair and irresponsible to all the smokers. All above leads to the conclusion that smoking should definitely be forbidden in public places.",CHN
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time jobs college requires them to spend a lot of money on books, camps, and adventure stuffs hosted by the school. by having part time jobs, they can also increase their own allowance as they have the extra income by the part time job. students will then put less burden on their parents. results wise, i personally think that if the student puts effort in organizing his or her own time well, he or she would not have any problems dealing with the busy schedule of working and schooling at the same time. As college students have part time job, they will also realize that money is hard to earn and their parents are working very hard just to get them to go to school and pay the expensive school fees. The students will then realize that savings are very important in their lives and hence they will start to be more spendtrift. As they have a part time job they also learn to be more independent and they will learn new life skills that they can use in the future. With that, I conclude that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. ",SIN
"Nowadays, many people start smoke more than the past especially in developed countries for example Japan, China and United State. Some people think that it should be banned in public while others disagree with it. On the on hand, some people might think that smoking should be prohibited in public places such as shopping malls, theatres, parks, and night clubs. As a result, smoking gives many disadvantages, for instance healthy problem, social disadvantage, or family disadvantage, not only for smokers but also people near them. Totally, smokers get less toxic from smoking than others near them. So it is the main reason that smoking should be prohibited in public places. On the other hand, some people might think that it will be limited smokers' freedoms under democracy. So it will be against constitution about human rights, if smoking has been banned in public at all. They think it should have some smoking areas for smokers where will not annoyed others in public places and smokers can smoking there. In conclusion, I personally think that it should not be banned in public places at all because it will be limited smokers' freedoms. At the same time, smokers should respect to others' freedoms as others respect theirs.",THA
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As everyone knows, lots of college students have a part-time job. I'm no exception. I also even got many part-time jobs at the same time, such as tutor who teaches sociology, cram school teacher, sales and so on. So I really agree has a part-time job in college life. There are some reasons to explain why we have a part-time job. First, now lots of goods are more expensive than before and families give children less pocket money. College students have to look for a part-time job to expense many things. In addition, I think that we can know many people who have their own characteristic in society, even be our friends. Finally, enhancing the social experience, practicing working attitude, gaining more jobs in the future and l can avoid to working nothing. And this is the main reason that college students to have a part-time job. In sum, having a part-time job let me understand that giving up halfway can't undertake any hard task nowadays.

"Smoking is a bad habit. I never like the cigarettes and smokers as well. The smoke of the cigarettes causes cancer of lungs along with other disease. Its so dangerous for health as drinking rather according to my point of view it's even more dangerous than a snake because even a snakman know that snake is dangerous but a smoker never thinks that cigarettes is dangerous he/she just love it. We should avoid to sit in the company of the smokers because it's smoke effect the nearby person more than the smoker. The reason is that the smoker inhale the smoke that is filtered while the persons in his/her company inhale un-filtered smoke that is more dangerous for health. In Pakistan it is law that cigarettes should not be sold to the persons who are under eighteen but unfortunately it is disobeyed. There is no one monitoring the sale of cigarette even if a policeman see someone smoking who is under eighteen, he never takes any action. Some people adopt this habit in the childhood when they see someone of their elders smoking while some people start smoking when they are young as a fashion or style but after sometime they become chain smokers. Some people start smoking when they are in tension because generally smokers say that cigarette releases the tension. We should aware the people from the drawbacks of smoking. We should not hate smoker but we should hate smoking.",PAK
"It is very good for college students if they could have a chance to do part-time job. Therefore, college student should have a part-time job for 3 reasons. Firstly, they could earn own money by themselves without asking for any money with their parents. College students who are not rich might have their budgets to live and could help their families. Secondly, they would learn how to manage their time when they have to do part-time job. They have to study and do the job. That is very hard and tied. So, they would get more experience to deal with their time to do 2 things equally and well. Finally, college student would get more new experiences about do a job than others. They would know how to cope with the problems in the company or stupid customers. It could apply with their study in the classes. So, their study might be better.

I am agreeing because I think that even if I was still smoking, it is not fair to others that they should have to suffer for my bad habits. There are the kids to think of as well as people who may have some sort of illness like asthma or bronchitis which we don't always know about because we don't know them personally. I reckon that if I want to smoke, then that is my business, but it is everybody's business if I start puffing smoke at them or in their air space. That to me is just being arrogant and rude and displays a total disregard for others. I would support restaurant bans in Japan or any country in return for a place where smokers could go to smoke without endangering others. I think that most smokers who have any sense of fairness, would agree with me on this. It is never too late to show consideration for others but it's a bit late to say you are sorry if someone dies because they have been breathing in your second-hand smoke. Then it would be like shutting the gate after you have already let the horse out.",ENS
"Nowadays, many students have the tendency of quitting school especially in college. Because of financial problem, they can't anymore afford to pay the tuition fee. But not all students are giving up. They still look for a way, for them to stay in the school and to continue their studies. When doing a part-time job, students can practice the lesson got from classes. Students can also earn money on their own. Taking a part-time job is guaranteed to give you more experiences before attaining a satisfying job. So, taking a job beside studying is a good choice for the young to solidify their position in the future job. Why can people grow up in this way? Students usually spend their parents ' money, they do not have to work hard so they hardly know its value. It's not until they have to try their best that they set much value on their parents ' money and long-lasting effort to bring them up. When they have to work to earn money for themselves, they will sure find how difficult it is. Furthermore, young people have to deal with many awkward cases that require them to react quickly though sensibly to get the best result. Such environment of work does not allow youngsters to be childish, indeed, they need to grow up in their thought and their action to adapt to the world of adult and business. Life was never easy.

"I disagree with this idea. I don't think that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. The main reason is that the most important thing for them is studying hard. I have three ideas to support my opinion. First, they have to realize how precious college days are. They can freely study what they really want to do only during college students. Before college students, they just did what their teachers forced or recommended them to do. And after their graduation from college, only a few of them will be able to do what they really want to do as their jobs. That's way I think that now is very precious and that they have to study hard, not work. Secondly, I've ever seen many bad examples of college students who have a part-time job. Some of them are sleeping even during classes because of tiredness from their jobs. Others often skip classes to go to their jobs. Still others get sick because they are too busy in both studying and working to get enough sleep or rest. They have to make a right decision about their priority, that is to say, they should consider which is more important for them, studying or working. Thirdly, such bad students as I've mentioned can have a bad influence on other students. For example, some students might skip classes more easily, sometimes without any reasons. And classes, especially group works will not work well because of such students. These examples are only a part of all. As a result, I insist that college students should put their priority on studying, not working.",JPN
"A part-time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. Workers are considered to be part time if they commonly work fewer than 30 or 35 hours per week. There are many reasons for working part time, including the desire to do so, having one's hours cut back by an employer and being unable to find a full-time job. ""Part-time"" can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes only a few courses, rather than a full load of coursework each semester. And it is very helpful to the student when he/she has a part time job because the salary may use for the allowance in everyday fare and the other need for school like books and the like. Many students whose work is part time job, sometimes students just take as a working experience not for the sake of extra money but the experience. Like me I want to have part time job for the experience only, so that I have experience when I apply for a certain job in the future. Part time job for the students is a big help for them even though it's a little bit difficult but they need to do it for many reason.",PHL
"I think smoking in public places such as indoors of a restaurant shoudn't be allowed. There's a few good reasons for me saying that. It has been proved that smoking kills you. Besides, would you like someone smoking next to you if you have your baby with you? Not only that, But I don't think I would like anyone to be smelling the nasty smoke odors while they're eating. I also think that it shoudn't be allowed because since it's indoors all the smoke gets caught inside and it can get sort of hard to even breathe. Choosing to smoke or not to smoke is a right that every human has. Those who choose to smoke should respect non-smokers while in enclosed areas. Many public buildings have a smoke free policy. Some restaurants also have a smoke free policy, but the majority do not. Having a smoke free policy in all restaurants creates numerous positive rewards. Banning smoking in restaurants will benefit the smoker, the business, and the non-smoker. Certain chemicals become more dangerous in small buildings. Smoking outside compared to smoking in a restaurant differs enormously. Outdoors, smoke spreads throughout a greater area. In restaurants however, smoke spreads throughout a small area. It can help not just the restaurant it self but also the society.",PHL

"Being On a Different Footing! A few years ago, I saw an article about banning smoking at all the restaurants. Some people agreed with the opinion, but others didn't. This argument could be a controversial issue. It was really interesting to me. In my opinion, banning smoking at all the restaurants is really helpful for majors. Here are some reasons why I think like this. First at all, there are a lot of people including both smokers and nonsmokers in restaurants. Smokers may think that smoking is one of their rights for their happiness. However, it could be a so selfish thought, because when nonsmokers smell tobacco smoke, the feeling is much more terrible than smokers think. Moreover, the fact that smoking is never healthy not only for smokers but also for nonsmokers. There is no one who wants to be in a bad state of health. Also, restaurant is a place to eat food. If someone smokes in the restaurant, other people in the place would lose their appetites. This issue is often dealt with in some debates. We can find the solution if try to being on a different footing. Smokers can smoke outside, but nonsmokers cannot stop breathing inside.",KOR
"I agree with the idea. Nowadays there are less and less people who smoke than there used to be. It is because a lot of people realize that smoking is very harm to our health. For example, if pregnancy women smoke, babies in their womb cannot breathe a few seconds and it is said that people who smoke constantly more likely to get cancer of lungs than people who never smoke. However, if a person smokes at public space such as restaurant, many people who are in there have to smoke passively or escape from there not to smoke passively. The worse thing is that passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking. Although some people say that smoker's rights should be protected, protecting rights of people who don't want to smoke is much more important. In addition, smoking is one of a luxury like drinking but smoking people must have a lot of risks, for instance cigaretto is very expensive due to special tax and very harmful, but they don't have any profits different from drinking Some Japanese people, especially young boys, think that smoking men are so cool under the influences of that a lot of Japanese men smoke at public area, but cigarette is a kind of drags.

"College students should not work while they are in school for several reasons. First, it is difficult to focus, second, it takes time away from studies, and third, sometimes a part-time job can lead to other paths which are distracting to the path of a degree which was original goal. If a student decides to work part time, the student will have additional responsibilities that will deter a student from the focus. If a student is to excel, he/she will need to put all energies into creating an environment that is conducive to a good study. It is the first time in a young students life, the student makes decisions as open as going to class or doing homework. Failure is a much larger possibility than in high school because at this point in a students life, the administration is treating them as an adult. Consequently, a job poses a threat. Money is quite a distracterSecondly, time from studies is the most important element in success at school. If a student takes on a heavy load the true determination of a students boils down to time management. Every hour is either spend studying, sleeping, going to class and having fun. The college experience is about networking, meeting people, learning and essentially getting good grades and landing a good job in his/her field. Finally, if a student is ideal for a position in a part time job, the employer might want to give the student additional responsibilities.

In spite of smoking may hurt health who smoke, but there still a lot of people like smoking today, they do not think this behavior is a serious problem, and they enjoy the feeling of smoking. Some said that smoking can reduce stress; some think that smoking can relieve anxiety moods, and other think that smoking can refresh themselves. Today smoking is around the world, not only among the old and the men people, but also among the youth and the women people, smoking is getting more and more serious problem. Restaurant is the place people eat and chat there, and enjoy the delicious foods there. Some of the restaurant almost is airtight place, in particular there have air conditioner in it, if someone smoke in the place may caused the air not fresh and everyone mat smell the bad air. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants public place and work place. The smoker should not smoke in the place where banned smoking. In order to keep your family healthy and the world's health, that all of the smoker should get rid of smoking behavior. It is not only good for themselves but also good for everyone in the world.",TWN
"I agree because it gives students several opportunities. First and foremost, I believe that it gives students responsibilities and obligations that must be met. Then let's not forget that they are also getting real job experience. With the job experience makes money and also any additional job skills that are necessary to perform their tasks. What usually carries over into college is that they learn to prioritize their workloads, organize their studies so that they may assimilate information in a more orderly and easier to remember process. Unless they are stressed out, their ability to focus is usually more heightened and they tend to maximize their time more efficiently. When they leave college and their part-time jobs, they usually do so having acquired not just learning skills or information, but tools and techniques that will carry them in good stead regardless of what job they get. If by chance they should find themselves in between jobs, they may be able to seek different kinds of work that their skills base may be transferred to. We know that many skills are transferable and see this in the business world quite frequently so this should be no different in a newly graduated student's case.",ENS
"Everyone now a days even teachers have a part time job like Architects nowadays have their own part time job being a teacher to tech their students what the teachers learned in their course and students to have a part time job at night they need money for their college tuition fees and their food for them, being in a part time job is very hard and you feel pressured every day you do things that you don't good at and your trying to do it by yourself that is pressure and you do your assignments and your part time job But the best reason for encouraging the young to take a part time job is to make them learn how hard money is earned. Many youngsters nowadays still do not appreciate the effort spent to get money and they have wasted too much of it, just because they do not know how hard to get it. Too much has been said about the wasting habit of the young these days but too little have we known about the ways to stop that. Encouraging the young to take part in a part time job can be an effective way to solve the problem. When the young stay at home, eat meals, play video games, watch movies and study, they do not bother to know how hard those things are fetched, they just enjoy them. But when working seriously, they can be aware of the tough environment that workplace brings, they need to face up to stress and tiredness when performing tasks, and because no one want to waste things that they have exchanged with much effort, so they are bound to appreciate the value of money and you feel like you're in an adult world or getting ready for your life A part time job, which is familiar and common for the young, can be an ideal option to welcome them to the adult life effectively.",PHL
"Part time job is a job which an individual performs at any organization for brief time for the sake of earning money. This could of the type that you have to spend a few hours at a job daily or you have to spend 2-3 complete days in a week for a job. There are many reason for which we have to adopt this course of action for earning money. The main reason is the bad financial conditions. Today there is economic recession in the whole world. And the poverty is increasing day by day. The people don't have much of the money to pursue their dreams of higher studies. So unwillingly they have to follow this course. In the day times they study at their schools and the evening they work at the hotels, libraries etc to manage their expenses. Some times along with their own expenses, they also have to earn something for their families as well. So it is a big social dilemma. Not only the student adopt the part time job but also the professional go for part time jobs to earn more money. for example doctors work in hospital for the whole day and in the evening times they run their own clinics. The reason once again is the lack of money. In doing all these thing we have to sacrifice one thing, that is, our social life. We are unable to give time to our family in a struggle to earn happiness for them. And in an unfelt manner they go very far from us. But the reason is once again the same, Poverty.",PAK
"Smoking kills. Don't they ever read the government warning even in a pack of a cigar? Smokers just don't listen. Smokers really are examples of a non tremulant and careless people. They don't care about what's happening in their system especially in their lungs. Despite that the government raises the price of tobacco to discourage people from smoking, smokers still continue to be a loyal fan of this habit and often waste their earnings just for cigarettes. Some governments had recently set up a law against smoking in public places, pub's, and some other places like restaurant. Would you rather breathe the smoke that's causing pollution or breathe the fresh air coming in your way? Some people hate to inhale the smoke from a cigar especially when eating a delicious food or sustenance from specialties of other restaurants. Smokers enjoy smoking to relax and have a peace of mind and to a greater degree, when that restaurant has the music that soothes and relates with your mood. Well, aren't they concern about the people around? You wouldn't even enjoy eating. Probably they will move to other spot just to evade the smoke. Besides that, owners will worry about their chairs or tables being burned and damaged by a simple stick of cigar. Indeed, smoking in restaurants must be banned. On the outcome of restricting smokers to use a certain place like a part of the restaurant, smokers will shift to another place causing them to smoke less frequent in restaurants. Having a cleaner, healthier environment especially in a restaurant will have a better cycle of the place and helping to boom the industries.",PHL
"Working will get the money as the income, and later that money will be use for buy some needs. Every people certainly want to get a job. Include the college student. But, I disagree with a statements that say even it is important for college students have a part â€“ time job. Because, I think part time job isn't the main thing that college students must be doing. The important thing for college students are study well, and later will get a great achievement. If the college students have a part time job, because they want to help the family economic problem, so they can pay the college fee with own income, or they want to get more a pocket money for buy a college needs, it is not banned. But, there are another way to get a money, if use for that reason. It is scholarship. All of college student can get it, but they must be good students. In part time job, they just working a few hours in a day. So if in the morning they study at college, then in the evening or when they go back from college, they start for working. And certainly they will feel proud because they can get the money from himself. But, part time job for college student have the negative effect, it is they will lost more time for study at home, or doing their college task. Because when they go back from their part time job, they will feel so tired, then they go to sleep without study. So, part time job can decrease a time for study and their achievement. But nothing problem if the college students have a part time job if they can manage the time well, they work but still diligent for study.",IDN
"I agree and I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job while attending college. It is important because the current global economic climate makes it so. Jobs are harder and harder to get and many graduates are struggling to get any kind of job. Having some work experience or on the job training may not guarantee to get them a job, but it will certainly help them if there is a fit between their skill sets and an advertised job. While they are working, they should attempt to get any other skills that can be gleaned from the job as well, just n case. These skills will never go to waste and will more than likely be put to use several times in the student's career. It would be nice to think that the recession will be resolved by the time students graduated and that may or not be the case. It is best to focus on what we can control rather then what we can't. In this way we are focused on honing our own skills rather than worrying about events that we have no control over. Either way it is always good to be prepared for any thing that may eventuate.",ENS
"I agree with the statement. I think college students should have a part-time job. First, it is true that a part-time job prevents us from studying, but from part-time job we can learn much more about society, economy, and how people feel when they communicate with stranger that we never learn at school nor club activities. For example, it is very difficult for staffs to satisfy customers while they may take it for granted to be dealt with kindly at a fast food restaurant. Employees have to act with responsibility during working, which skill is not gained so quickly. But in order to be an adult making society better, we have to be at least responsible for anything about ourselves. Second, we can have wonderful friends by having a part-time job. In fact I started a part-time job at a fast food restaurant this spring. During the job we have to speak gently, make smile and do tasks speedy and accurately. After the job I am always hungry and exhausted. Nevertheless the reason I want to continue this job is the members of stuff. They encourage me, and make me feel to be like them. They are very important for me to get over the hard jobs. We will get out into the world after graduating *** University and have to take some actions in order to make the world equally more peaceful. In another words, we need to know widely about this society and this world. A part-time job is a good method for us, college students.",JPN
" Smoking is a common problem which we have taken so much action. Some one said the situation would be batter if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with it and at the same time, I think a kind of restaurant should be set for some people smoking. On the one hand, smoking should be banned. There are so many people who are affected by cigarette. Many illnesses such as pneumonia are results from smoking, and many people died from those or being afflicted. A lot of families are facing hardness or break. What's more, many teenagers learn to smoking which will take them to being unhealthy and treasonous. Parents are anxious and worrying about their children. Considering those disadvantages, smoking should be banned. However, although we have taken many measures, the behavior still exists. Smoking being completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is a kind of forcible step. Through legal system forcing people away from cigarette is a kind of measure we take when it's necessary. On the other hand, some people smoking like a chimney may be hard to giving up smoking right away. So in my opinion, it's needed to create a sort of restaurant that people smoking can get together to smoke a little and exchange experience about lay aside the habit of smoking. In the meanwhile, let those smokers be limited for the time they can smoked in those restaurant. All in all, smoking being completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is needed, but what's more, we should consummate relevant laws and regulations.",CHN
"Some days ago, I watched a video called Justice. This is a class held in Harvard university. The famous professor showed some data to his students. The cigarette factory make many profit by producing cigarettes and they pay large sums of tax to the country. I can't remember the number of the data exactly, but this profit is much bigger than the money spend in curing the illness that the cigarettes bring to us. So this draw forth the consideration of whether the government should forbid smoking when all of us know the bad effect of smoking. In one aspect, smoking enlarge the social wealth and give more people jobs. However in the other aspect, smoking results in cancel and other illness. So what should the government do and what should we do? my opinions are as follows. Firstly, I think we should completely banned smoking in all the restaurants step by step because it is impossible to carry out this big plan in a short time. With the develop of the technology, people have change their view on cigarette, and few and few people are smoking now, which suggest us that banned smoking completely is possible. Secondly, I think we should not allow cigarettes destroy out health even it have some many advantages to the country. There must exist some other things that can take place cigarettes. We can develop that factory. We hope that we could have a no-smoking world in the future.",CHN
"No, I don't agree with that. In my opinion, college is not a job training center, but a grand temple of keeping knowledge and learning. As a college student, we certainly have freedom and maturity to make our own decisions, including deciding to get a part-time job or not. However, most part-time jobs are just wasting time to get little money. Except for contacting to more people and some skills, all you're doing is keeping repeating the same movement, such as doing dishes and pouring water, etc. It is probably not related to your work in the future, and giving no help to your resume. Furthermore, you can do nothing after work, since you're so exhausted after work, you would only want to get a rest. On the other hand, you can study more; go on a trip, or doing something more meaningful during the same period. What a shame! Second, since the rate of jobless people is still high, the part-time working students are definitely another pressure for them. Plus, the salary students get paid is not much. If we have enough allowance we got from parents for living expenses, there is no urgent need for us to get a part-time job in our 20s. To conclude, there are more deficits than advantages in having a part-time job. It may cut off your studying hours and your leisure time. What's more, what you get paid back is much less than your cost, your invaluable youth.",TWN
"Smoking should be allowed at the restaurants in Japan. Smoking is a personal choice and no one has the right to tell you what you can or cannot do. I have never been to Japan, but I think that the people there probably feel the same way. The best restaurant is the one that best accommodates the wishes of its customers, and restaurants stand to gain the most by attracting as many customers as possible. However, I do not think that this freedom should come at the expense of another's; namely, the nonsmokers. In the same way that people who want to smoke should be able to do so, people who do not want to smoke or be around people who are smoking should not have to do so. Therefore, the best solution is to simply establish both smoking and nonsmoking areas in restaurants. It is also important that these areas be well separated and that a good air circulation system be in place. I have been to a few restaurants where the non-smoking area really didn't seem that much different from the smoking area, and of course this affected my dining experience. In conclusion, smoking should not be banned at all the restaurants in Japan as long as people who do not smoke can still enjoy them.",ENS
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because do part-time job can make college students get more knowledge of the live. If students have no job experience they must meet something risks. For example: In society they cannot have enough experience to find normal job. This is why parents ask their son to find part job to get some job experience Second when we get some part-job, we can meet different someone else. I think if we meet more people that we can learn more things. This thing maybe bad news but can let us learn experience to avoid that. Like my experience. I worked in the elementary school. I must take care of students in their class. In the fact this work is so hard because this students too difficult to control They make me so tired, but I think the experience can make me faced difficult things can get enough braves. The experience is very important than any else. Although part-time job maybe difficult for students but if we can make money by this part-time job and use this part-time to learn more knowledge and more friends we can feel happy.

"Should smoking be banned in all public places? I think it is a very serious problem during the smokers. Some support the policy, some against the policy. It is hard to decide which is right or wrong. In my mind, I support the point to ban the smoking in all public place, like restaurants, bus station, and so on. Not for others, but also for the smokers. Various modern researches show that smoking is very harmful to smoker. Smoking causes various diseases for example, when smoking much oxygen is used and less oxygen come to the brain, lungs and heart. This is very dangerous to young people. People should have a good health to do everything. Without a health body, person cannot do something that you like to do. Smoking also has great influence on family. As you know, smoking cost a lot of money. So smoking is not a lightly economic burden. And more terrible things are that smoking will damage DNA, which will change family from physiology and smoking cannot be stopped easily like drugs.

Only a comfortable environment, people can live a happy live. So I support the idea to ban the smoking on public.",CHN

"I don't agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at all. This is not because I am a smoker. In fact, I don't smoke at all and hate smoking. Then, there are some reasons why I think so. These days, it is very often said that smoking is not good for our health and smoking tend to get a cancer. However, many people smoke in spite of the advice. In addition, there is an opinion that when nonsmokers breathe the smoke of cigarette, nonsmokers tend to get a cancer more than smoker tend to do. Only because of these reasons, it is too one-sided to adapt smoker to nonsmoker. In restaurants, if they ban smoking in all areas, people who want to smoke can't smoke and if they put up with smoking, they can't enjoy themselves and maybe they feel bad. I think that it is good to make the partition wall or the partition room that separate smokers from nonsmokers. When we do it, it isn't one-sided and it is a fair solution, I think. In restaurants these days, some make such things and shop assistants ask us whether we smoke or not or which seats we sit down. So, it is nice to be complete. Therefore, there is no necessity to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",JPN

Because a man who had tobacco in his hands was walking and a girl was also walking forward him, then that tobacco was in her eye!! Her ability of looking was as far lower than before. Only she was walking, but she didn't look. It was very terrible. So smoker is really careful about around situation. My father had been one of the heavy smokers.

"Since most of the family's before face mild or extreme poverty, most of the students got part time jobs in restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores and etc in order to get proper education. They use their salaries to pay for their tuitions, books, clothes and other necessities. That is why dual roles of college students as part time workers and students have been common since our fathers ' time. I remember my father telling me stories about his experiences as a working student during his college years. He said that having the role of a working student was very hard because being able to maintain both his work and studies was a difficult task. There were times when he was exhausted from his work, yet he could not rest because he still had to do his assignments and study for the lessons. But after a period of time, he left his job in order to fully concentrate on his studies. Based on my father's past experiences, I can only say that part time jobs for college students may hinder their goals in getting good grades. Some students may say that they can maintain and excel both their academics and work, but there will come a time when their health might collapse due to exhaustion, extreme pressure and lack of proper sleep. Others may say that they will get part time jobs inside their schools as scholarship grants, but even this may hinder their grades because of the conflicting schedules. They may say that they will find time to finish both their assignments and jobs, but what if their classes are until 5PM and they have no long breaks? College students may take part time jobs as long as they can handle all the workload, manage their grades and maintain their health.",PHL
"I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Unlike high school student, college student must learn and study more voluntarily and hard. Also, they have to learn about real society and go outside. To do so, a part-time job is one of the most reasonable means. In fact, almost all of them think about their future, for example, job, their own family, and death, more seriously. I have spent every day alone since I entered the college, and I'm poorer than the life of hometown. I have a part-time job so that I can live by oneself. As you know when you work, there are a lot of things which we should learn. For instance, we are supposed to learn the way of communicating the others and to have responsibilities than ever and so on. My friend, Takeru, lives alone and makes living by oneself. In spite of this life style, he has very grate record and belongs to tennis club. I respect him so much as my good friend, and also, he gives nice advices that will be surely useful in my future.

College students comparatively have many free times. So I think that they have enough time to work. In fact, I am belonging to music club and I have to practice the guitar, but I can have time to work and can earn my living cost. My friends also try to have time to work and they can do that. If I would not have a part-time job, I spend idle hours in my free time. I feel I am spending precious time when I work at gas station. A part-time job is not easy, but we can feel fulfillment.

More number of people die from second hand smoking and more children start smoking by the age of 12 or even earlier. Its advisable to hide kids from seeing adults smoke because kids get curious and influenced. I would always wonder why people get so caught up with it. Its just a flavor of air that gets in your system and it wouldn't even do good on you instead, it would take your life away by getting 8 months of your lifetime with each cigarette butt.

"In my opinion, holding a part time job also the student to gain experience in the working world, as well as using the money obtained to use as extra pocket money to use, save or pay off tuition debts. I think that working while studying is an invaluable experience because first, a certain amount of working experience may translate into an added advantage when it comes to looking for jobs after graduation. This is because some employers will prefer to employ students who already have prior job experience. Also, working while studying allows the student to use his spare time to make extra money. The money earned can be used for many purposes. Especially in Singapore, where most students studying in university are paying school fees via loans, working now allows them to save up some money before they graduate, and the money can be used to repay the schools fees before the interest starts to snowball. However, working alongside studying requires very good time management, which not many students may be able to handle. Having a part time job effectively means an additional commitment, one that cannot be ignored at whim. Coupled with the extra-curricular activities in school and schoolwork, the burden may be too heavy to bear for the student. Also, the time consumed by working means that the student now has less time for other activities, be it studying or socializing. For many, university is the last phase of education, and it may seem pointless to work while in school since working is going to be an integral part of life after graduation. Weighing the pros and cons of working part time, I believe that ultimately, if one is able manage his time properly, the detriments can be easily mitigated. ",SIN
"Although how to ban smoking is a hard social problem, we must try our best to find the way, since the harmful effect added on people, not only the man he himself smokes but also every person around him, is known to all and can't be neglected. A man who is addicted to smoking tends to smoke every time and everywhere, even out of control. If you set a sign reading no smoking, he will just say in mind :okay, I should pretend not to see it, not to mention that he will keep the ban in mind. In fact, the effect of the ban hasn't appeared genarally so far, neither in restaurants nor even in school. But how can we do? First of all, we should strengthen the law constraint against smoking in public, i. e. increase penalty of the person who violates the ban. Secondly we should try to build our good atmosphere in society. It's ideal to educate people the harm that smoking can do on us, including those who are smoked by others. Besides, whether a person has a discipline of smoking in pubilic is a matter about social morality and basic qaulity that a man should possess. In that way, increasing public qaulity is the central mission since it's the essential and radical factor of how willing the man is to avoid smoking in public. There lies the way, maybe long and narrow, of the effective ban on smoking in public, for our faith in the final existence of no-smoking public places.",CHN
"In my opinion, it is not so important for university students to have a part-time job. Firstly, university students should focus on their studies because they are going to learn professional knowledge and the pace of university education is usually fast-paced. Handling school works is not an easy task already. If students has a part-time job while they are studying, they may not be able to handle both sides unless they make more effort and manage their time well. In the worst case, a student may have a bad academic result and even become unemployed from the part-time job due to poor performance, making him/her difficult in finding jobs after graduation since he/she has a lower competitiveness compared with those who concentrate on their studies and get a good result. It could be argued that having a part-time job can gain working experience which may increase the quality of a student. However, I believe that having an internship would be a better choice. The reason is that a part-time job such as being a private tutor may not provide any certification. However, internships provided by companies can give students official certification and also evaluation from the employer. These definitely increase the quality of a resume. In addition, students usually take part in internships in summer holidays, so it is easier for them to manage their time and their academic performance would not be greatly affected. Since a part-time job may affect the academic performance of a student seriously and there is a better alternative to gain working experience, I think that it is not so important for university students to have a part-time job.",HKG

Perhaps I did not have a car when I was 18, nor could I really afford to go out drinking with my friends as often as I would have liked, it is nonetheless the case that because I never worked while in college I was able to truly enjoy taking my classes and focus on my studies. This approach paid off as I graduated near the top of my class and was then able to get the job I wanted (as opposed to a job that would simply allow me to pay the bills) and make a smooth start to my career. Others were not so fortunate: one of my friends from college had to pay his way (his parents could not afford to support him) and he was only able to stay in school for a little over a year before he finally dropped, suffering from exhaustion. I feel there is a lesson to be learned here and I have already started putting some money aside to put my own kids through college one day.",ENS
"I agree that smoking should be banned all the restaurants in Japan. I recently came back from a study abroad trip in China where I was there for one year. In this time, I saw that many restaurants in China had already banned smoking at restaurants and additionally some of them and made it illegal to smoke at other public places. If you smoke in these public places, you would be given a ticket, and while the fine was not too hefty, it is enough to discourage the average smoker from lighting up in a place where they will get caught. Next, I agree that it is much more healthy for the other people in the restaurants if smoking is banned at the restaurants. It is not right to have to breathe in the secondhand smoke of many smokers around you as the secondhand smoke is much more dangerous than the smoke they are inhaling. Japan and China are similar in many ways even though there are also different in many ways, but I do think that smoking should not be allowed at any restaurants anywhere in the world. It is already 2011, and the fact that smoking is still allowed at many restaurants in the U. S. and apparently at restaurants in Japan is just embarrassing.",ENS
"Not only does smoking kills the person using it, but also the people who are inhaling the smoke. Second hand smoking is what they call it. If you never heard of that, it means that the smoke coming out of a cigarette is almost twice as poisonous and toxic compared to actually using it. Either you are a user or an inhaler it is still the same time. That is why as a person who doesn't smoke, I would like to push for a law to stop smoking in Restaurants around the country. Why is this so? Ever experience going inside a bar a restaurants where you can smell the smoke coming out of the smoking area? For me, this happened to me a lot of times already since I love eating in such kind of bar and grill restaurants. I know that that as a student, I don't have any right to implement this to all restaurants all over the country because there will always be a conflict of interest between the people who are supporting this campaign and the people producing cigarette and bar and restaurant owners. However isn't it that we are the ones killing our environment and ourselves? Doesn't the future generation deserve to see the beauty of our nature before it gets destroyed by pollution? My answer to that entire question is yes. We should start finding a solution for this problem of smoking. Even if my suggestion will not be recognized by those authority responsible, I am encouraging everyone who are using cigarettes to limit smoking in areas where there are a lot of people around him or her",PHL
"It is good for college students to have a part-time job. I think this because I have had a part-time job for a long time. In my part-time job, I work as a waitress at Denny's. By working at a restaurant, I can learn a lot about people skills and how to deal with different kinds of people. In the business world, people skills are very important because they help you to be more successful. The better your people skills are, the more successful you will be. Also, many of my friends have part-time jobs too. Some of them are waitresses, but some of them also work at internships which is pretty impressive. I am not ready to work at a real company yet, and right now my job as a waitress is good enough for me. I am lucky enough for my parents to pay for most of my college, so the money I make is mostly just for me. I hope that other college students can be like me and can find part-time work so that they can make some money too. It is very fun to go out with your friends on the weekend, and it is definitely no fun if you cannot go out because you have no money. Waitressing is a good job for every girl to experience at least for a little bit.",ENS
"I am very surprised to hear that smoking is not already banned at restaurants in Japan. I always think of Japan as this futuristic place where everyone is enlightened, healthy, and technologically savvy. These may be stereotypes, but if smoking really is allowed in restaurants in Japan it would be in sharp contrast to the country's worldwide image. Smoking is not allowed in the restaurants here, and I think this is a good thing. This is because smoking can give you cancer and lung cancer in particular is one of the worst ways to go. Unfortunately, smoking is highly addictive and people who start having a very difficult time quitting, but this is no excuse to allow them to affect the health of other people by smoking in public places. Finally, smoking is very expensive. We learned in school that every year a smoker may spend thousands of dollars on cigarettes. I have to say that I think this is a waste of money, because cigarettes don't really do anything for you. Alcohol is kind of the same way, that is, it doesn't really do anything for you, but at least when you drink safely and do not drive, you will not affect the health of other people around you.",ENS
"<Important Thing to University Students> Have you ever done a part time job? Nowadays, a lot of university students work part time job as well as study their major for many reasons, so they are always busy. I think part time job is quite important to university students. First, university students have no money. University students have little opportunity to earn money, because of their status as a student that is hard to get a full time job. In addition, if students' parents are not rich and not give them much money, students are inevitably poor. That means, part time job is source of income for university students and it is very important to them. University students have many places that require money. Above all, the university tuition is really high, so it is hard to student make money for tuition. Furthermore, students should buy several major books every single semester and those books so expensive. Moreover, they need to cost of living and room rent and so on. There are many things that university students should pay money, so to earn money for these things they should have part time job. To university students, the part time job is so important, because they don't have money and have many things that they should pay money. Now, let's have some applause for every student who works part time job and live life to the full.",KOR
"I agree this topic. I have three reasons for this opinion. First I think that part-time jobs are studying of society. College students will become members of society. We have to accustom to working. It is important to experience for work. If we college students have got a part-time job once, I think when we get a job, it is easy to work. Second we learn the community of society. If we don't get a part-time job, we have only the community of school. I think that we college students have to have several of communities, and we improve our sense of value. Then we will do well when we are employed. Finally we college students have to start to independence from our parents. Because by get a part-time job we earn some money. In the money point we remove our parents from responsibility. We need some money for playing eating and so on. We have to thank for parents, so it is good to earn some money by our own. We also can independence from parents in the side of mind. I think we are able to grow up by working. Therefore I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"Hong Kong Government had introduced a law on banning smoking in all restaurants. People may have different opponents on that. However, in my opinion, smoking should definitely be prohibited in all restaurants in Hong Kong. There are many reasons which can support the argument. Firstly, smoking has long been defined as an unhealthy habit. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of different chemical compounds, which mostly are toxic ingredients. One common toxic ingredient is the Nicotine, which will cause addiction to the smokers. Once people intake nicotine, they will find it very hard to get rid of smoking. Cigarettes also contain Ammonia, which scientists have discovered that it will let you absorb more Nicotine. Another ingredient in a cigarette is tar, which is a chemical causing cancer. According to research, smokers have a probability ten times higher than non-smokers in getting lung cancer. And they are three times more likely to have to have stroke. Having smoking in all restaurants can cause health problem to both the smokers and the passive smokers. From the business point of view, touristism is one of the most important economic factors in Hong Kong. If smoking is prohibited in all restaurants, non-smoking tourist will be more likely and be pleased to spend more time and money enjoying the air-cleaned environment in the restaurants. To conclude, banning smoking in all restaurants can cause less people suffer from health problem and enhance the economy in the restaurants in Hong Kong. Smoking should be prohibited in all restaurants in Hong Kong.",HKG
"I agree with it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In present have a part-time job a lot. Example they are salesperson in the bookstore department store, food shop and coffee shop, they are receptionist in the hotel, they are employees in the restaurant. College students have a free time. They spent time useful. They help parents about reduce money. when they want anything, they can buy as needed, without asking money from parents. So, they must know saving money. Education in present not in classroom only. We must study from outside and environment around us. I think life in reality is always interesting.

"Yes. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, we should consider the merits of why they should hold such a job. The first reason is that, it provides them with some working experience so that they wouldn't be thrown out to the deep blue sea after graduation. By holding a part-time job, they will be able to learn some skills which may be relevant for them once they start working such as responsibility and management. The second reason as to why it is important is that if them a sense of independence when it comes to managing their own finances. By earning their own money, they get a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. They learn that money doesn't fall from the sky and that they can support their leisure activities. The third reason is that holding a part-time job gives them something else to look forward to and diversify their lives. It will allow them to not have such a mundane life and also gives them a chance to do new things and meet new people. At the end of the day, we will have to consider time management when it comes to juggling school and work. ",SIN
"One day, every person in the world will facing the reality that they should go to work and earn some money to keep living. Even Money is not everything, People still need it for their own life. It is important for college students to have a part time job. It can help them to explore their own talent and make them ready to facing the business world. It could be any job, such as a restaurant waiter, salesman, even as an entrepreneur. Part time job is not like a full time job. Part time job have a shorter work time and also have less of money than full time job. Although they are not earn a lot of money, but they get an experience of a life time. It can make them become more mature and understand how hard working is. So they will never get easily spend their own money from now. Part time job also can help their parents to educate their character. Because every success person in the world start their successful from their own life character. Without any good Character, some one will easily fall down, even they are already in the top. So the best lesson from part time job is not how to earn a money, but an Experience of life that can make them tough, strong, and ready to facing the world.",IDN
"I agree with the statement. And I think it is important for college students t o have a part-time-job. I have two reasons. Firstly, I think that part-time-job is one of learning society. Part-time-job provides college students with many important things. For example, They can kn ow severeness of society, manners in working, and pleasure of salary. I think these experience surely raise a person. Most people have to work after graduating university or graduate school. If he or she has never worked before then, I think it is very dangerous. I think it is too hard for a person who has never had part-time-job to work suddenly in this severe society. It is necessary to experience walking during college stud ent. Secondly, college students need a lot of money. Elementary school, junior high school, and high school students usually can get their money from their paren ts every month. However, college students are not children yet. So I think the y have to earn their money by oneself. Thanks to a part-time-job, college stud ents can help their parents. Part-time-job brings us great experience and money. I experienced and learned many things through a part-time-job too. I think these are very worthful.

"Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? About this, different people hold different views. Some people agree and some people don't agree with it. In my opinion, I agree with it, that is, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. There have been a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking. What's more, some of them are addicted to it. They can't live without it. So they will also smoke at public places such as restaurants. But nonsmokers hate it, they hate to smell it. They even complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to their health. Therefore, it is really harmful to people in the restaurant. It will also affect people's appetite. I hate them who smoke at the restaurant. Firstly it does harm to everyone. Secondly, I think it is an irresponsible behavior. Last but not least, it can pollute the clean air. Nowadays, more and more people come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can lead to lung cancer, and heart problem. Smokers also decide to give up smoking. Some of them also think that the law to ban people smoking can encourage them to give up smoking.

"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The answer might be the opposite before I got two part-time jobs this summer. After working from 9 am to 7pm in the place where I work now, I find several reasons why it is important for college students to work part-time. First, by working part-time we gain different kinds of working experiences before we graduate and work full-time. Full-time jobs mostly require professional knowledge and skills and it is more serious, thus it is more difficult to change your job once you are on the position. What part-timer needs to do is often less professional. When you are applying a part-time job, there should be more choices. And by doing different kinds of jobs you gain different kinds of experiences, which is precious because it might be a help to your future career, for example you might learn some professional knowledge through the work, and from various kinds of working experiences you might determine what you really want. Secondly, by earning money on our own, we would spend money in a more careful way. It is common for young people to spend money on something unnecessary. Part-time jobs usually are not high-paid jobs. By being paid based on the working hours, we realize how uneasy it is to earn a living and thus build correct concepts on money. Still there are some more benefits by working part-time, such as it is a help to those students that face economic pressure. To sum up, I think as long as students are able to use their time well, that is, part-time jobs wouldn't influence their studying, it would be beneficial to students if they have a part-time job.",TWN

Besides that, we learn a lot of new experience which we may not get from our lectures in campus.

"When we go to the hospitals, we can see a lot of ads that talk about smoking. Because it is very harmful to our health, it can cause the lung cancer. In our lives, we always see many people smoking in the restaurants even if the restaurants announced that smoking is banned. The air in the restaurants mixed with dangerous material is scared. It not only makes the smell strange but also destroys our body. However, now secondhand smoke is also known by the people. Even you are not a smoker, you are exposed under the dangerous air also lead to the cancer. The risk made by secondhand smoke we face is more than smokers made. If the customers want to smoke, they can build a smoking room for them or tell them to smoke outside. Every place has different manners of restaurants. In my opinion, the most important thing is that every customer's health. So, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Otherwise, I think that government should increase the fine of smoking if smokers smoke in the restaurants. Because they not only harm themselves but also harm other people's health, to do so, we can see a better effect on the policy, we can create a healthy environment we live.",TWN
"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Why I think so is that college students are semi-working people. To work is one of the important things for people to live in a society. So I think to have a part-time job is important. For example, I work in the private school as a teacher. In the work, I learn many things, that is to say, common senses. I think those senses are necessary to live in a society. Part-time job is very appropriate to practice to lead your life in society, I think. And, to earn money is another thing important for college students. We are not working adults. But, we are not entirely children, too. So I think, college students have to work to earn money, which they use for them to go shopping, drink, or travel. The money for their leisure must be paid by their own. I, too, pay my train fare. Eventually, what I want to say is part-time job is a way to study what society is. To learn that is difficult, so part-time job is surprisingly useful for that. If it was a trivial experiment, we study something advantageous for us.",JPN

There are different types of drugs some are in the form of powder, others are in the form of liquid, but the drugs that at use for smoking purposes are cigarrates and etc. the smokers take their smoke inside themselves which is very dangerous for the human lungs and causes a lot of disease related to lungs.

Because these places provide a sort of relaxation to the public. Not only in restaurant but smoking is strictly banned at all such public places which are a source of relaxation for the people from their daily routines. In the restaurants people goes for outing, they go their also for having meals and if the smokers start smoking there, the people gets disturbed. And they try to get rid of such places and it becomes harmful to both the public and the honours of the restaurants, because they did not get enough benefit.

"I most certainly agree that college students should have a part-time job. However, I do not agree with students using their part-time job as their excuse of poor academic performances. There are various reasons of which I agree with students having a part-time job; however, the main reason is to gain work experience before graduation. As well, I sincerely believe that any person, after age of 18, should sustain their own life. By having a part-time job during a college student's academic life, all reasons above can be established. If a college student graduates without any work experience, they are most likely to have difficulty hunting for a job. If they do succeed in finding a job, students without any work experience will definitely have a very difficult jump start. Therefore, to succeed in a working environment, work experience before graduation is definitely required. I believe after the age of 18, any person should be able to sustain themselves. Although a simple part-time job will not satisfy all the monetary needs of a college student, it will help decrease the amount owing to the bank. By sustaining your own life, a college student will most likely learn to be more responsible and will gain more respect for their parents. Hence, I believe that any college student should, at least sometime during their academic career, have a part-time job.",TWN

So if smoking is still never mind used in the restaurant, it will disturb the guest there. Beside of it, we are as the owner and the user this earth, so we have to take care our earth. If the smokers smoke everywhere, more over in the public place, it same with that they kill people slowly. Because the smoke will come to the body and will be illness. The passive smoker is more dangerous than the active smoker The government must be active to forbid the smokers to smoke in the restaurant in order to make the sterile place from smoke, and make the guest fell happy and not disturbed when come to the restaurant.

"I think that smoking should not be banned at all restaurants in Japan. Of course, a lot of studies show that smoking is harmful not only for smokers, but also the people around smokers. Smoking causes the lung cancer; it almost becomes a commonsense. However, many smokers continue to smoking although they know the commonsense. A study shows that otherwise once a person is used to smoking, it is difficult that he gives up smoking, smoking help smokers concentrate on their works, or make smokers feel relax. These effects make it more difficult for smokers to give it up. Restaurants are the places where people feel comfortable and relax through the dishes. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, those who make it a rule to smoke a cigarette after eating will feel uncomfortable. The owners who manage restraints should not make them feel such uncomfortable feelings and they will not. This is why I insist that smoking should not be banned at restaurants. On the other side, it is also important that those who don't smoke should not feel uncomfortable because of smokers. The owners should make effort as well as they can. If it becomes true, more people have more comfortable and better times.",JPN
"In the past decade, many developed countries have recognized the harmful effects of smoking and made legal regulations about smoking. For instance, the U. S. forbids anyone to smoke indoors, while Japanese law bans smoking on the streets. Korea has made some changes as well, forbidding smoking in public places such as school and bus stop. However, there are no regulations for restaurants yet, which causes many discomforts for non-smokers. Korean culture has been especially generous for smokers. One can smoke in many restaurants, especially the ones with grilling facilities. Smoking is also allowed in many coffee shops with smoking zone, in most karaoke, and in almost every bar. However, now that the harms tobacco can cause are known in public, non-smokers need to hold up their basic human right to be healthy. It would be the best to ban smoking at all restaurants, but considering smokers' own rights and interests of the tobacco products corporation, this could take forever. Instead, non-smokers need to take a slower, but steadier route. The difficulty of separating smoking-zone from the regular dining place is not so much of a work. All a restaurant needs to do is to either make a enclosed smoking area in the shop or to limit the smoking zone only to the outside terrace. The government can take a part, too. The government can increase the tax rate for tobacco products, which will reduce the number of smokers eventually. The small steps will lead to a complete ban of smoking not only at restaurants, but also at any other indoor places.",KOR
" As is known to all, part time jobs never fail to appeal college students. A part time job can always teach something that you can not learn in class apart from giving you money. Time and intelligence can be fully used, ability and courage can be practiced, and you are bound to be fully rewarded. So as far as I'm concerned, it's important for us college students to have a part time job. For one thing, part time job offers you a golden opportunity to intercourse with a lot of people who you seldom have access to make friends with and who you can surely learn much from. This is very important for us, since we're highly likely to be locked in the ivory tower. It is often the case that we bury ourselves in books and tests and even isolate from the society. In addition, doing part time jobs, to some degree, makes students aware of something like duty and thrifty. I used to spend lavishly. But since I have done some part time job, I fully recognized that earning money is truly not an easy thing. Besides, students can gain a sense of achievement by earning money themselves which does good to their mental health. Last but not least, students can really learn a lot of skills and get self-improvements. To sum up, the advantages of doing part time jobs far overweigh the disadvantages. With a little bit of caution, you can acquire money, friendship, practice and fun in the same time. So why not?",CHN

They can use that money for paying college duties. In the other hand, they can be more appreciate money. Because many university students can feel how difficult for people to get money.

"In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause allergic coughing to many people. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it which may later develop into a habit. Especially in the restaurant, there is a lot of food, it will imminently in people's mouth; therefore, smoking in the restaurant is the worst influence to people's health! From most people's perspective, the drawbacks of totally banning cigarette smoking in restaurants outweigh its benefits. Smoking is a health issue and it should be prohibited. The problem is, in spite of its terrible effects on health, quite a lot of people take up this dangerous habit. The number of smokers is increasingly large, so they can affect public opinion and the economy. If we totally ban smoking right now, not considering the smokers, things may get out of hand. The only thing we can do now is to ban smoking step by step, beginning with a partial ban and then a total ban. Publicity and education are also indispensable to show smokers and non-smokers the lethal nature of cigarette smoking.",TWN
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For many people, all the restaurants are a place to go for delicious food. It is wrong that you smoke in the restaurant. Most people in the world don't smoke. Obviously, there are lots of people hated smoking like me. For my parts, I wish to be banned at all public places in the country as well as at all the restaurants in the country. For example, you imagine that family having two kids goes to the restaurant. Kids wait a delicious food but there are smokers next to family. Do the parents think that it is good? Course not. Smokers can say why smoking is bad. Smokers can say why we can't smoke over thinking others But we should think all kinds of people. It can damage not only smoker's health but also nonsmoker's health. Moreover it influences enormous effect to nonsmoker. Long time ago, I saw news about this. There was family. Father and brother smoke in the house. But nonsmoker, younger sister was died. Why? I really talk to you how smoking is bad. It is much bad to non smoker. So I hope to be banned.",KOR
"Smoking is a bad addiction to cigarettes. Once a person falls in victim of it, it is very difficult for him to avoid smoking. It is most common in our youth now but most of our elders are also having this bad habit. I think so people are illiterate and don't know about the harmful aspect of smoking. Even if they know, still they are so badly addicted that they remove or finish this bad habit. People become addicted to smoking due to bad company and accepting free offers of drug pushers. Now a day it is too much spread not only in foreign countries but in Pakistan too up to great extent. Health is wealth. But I think so this proverb is useless and meaningless because people are wasting their money or wealth on much useless thing which instead of benefiting them, they only spoiling their whole lives and money and creating serious tension for themselves and their parents. Smoking is a course. It is very harmful to human life and also to the nature and environment. Smoking is often prohibited in restaurants and other public places but most of the people disobeying the rules to do smoking. The smoke of cigarette and cigars are taken in the body along with food. And people other than smoker become chain smokers and are harmed too. Cigarette and smoking is the major causes of lung cancer and other skin and respiratory diseases. The smoke along with food contaminates it and spoils the beneficial Aspects and effect of food and our body do not get nutrition. Hazart Muhammad (PBUH) has also prohibited and said to avoid the addiction prevailing things. Smoking must be strictly banned in restaurants and hotels. They intoxicate the mind and also have become a major cause of early death rates. We must save our life and others and should not follow these bad habits and should make our country prosper.",PAK
"Smoking should be banned in restaurants because people eating in the restaurants smell the scent of the cigarette and while they are eating they cannot eat their food properly and they cause pollution inside the restaurants.

What they don't tell you in cigarette ads they want you to become addicted. They worry when those numbers decline because they need new smokers to replace the ones who die each day from smoking related illness. Many teens start smoking because of the fact that they have friends or older relative who smoke and influenced them to smoke cigarettes. Some teens look at smoking as a way to get to parties, dates, or other difficult social situations. Smoking gives them something to do with their hands and makes them feel older or more sophisticated. Some teens smoke because they look to young and that smoking may make them feel more like an adult. SMOKING KILLS! STOP SMOKING!",PHL
"A part-time job is defined as a job outside the curriculum time of the college student. I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. However, the supporting reasons are subjected to the assumption that the student can manage his academic demands before taking up a job. Having a part-time job will allow a student to be more financially independent and learn to manage his finance, which is an essential skill to have. With the extensive expenditure of a college student, it would relief the burden off their parents or other sources of finance if they were able to find a part-time job. Moreover, students can learn interpersonal skills through working, which would benefit them in their future career. Students can also benefit others through their work by providing part-time work only when required by their employers, which is a cheaper and more efficient alternative for the employers. It would be a fruitful way of using his knowledge and spending his time. However, there is a limit to the job of a student as his primary aim is to ensure that he does well academic-wise. He should not sacrifice his academic work for his part-time job. ",SIN

It is hard to picture that I need to stand for ten hours in the same place, it is so boring. Apart from this, all colleagues in the retail store are experienced, only I am new and without any experience. I do not what I need to do, so I just keep standing and facing our customers without doing anything but pretending to smile. Luckily, my colleagues are kind, they always taught me how to service different customers. They are willing to help me in all means, therefore, I could finish my first day safely but I am really very tired at that night. No matter how tired I am, I still need to wake up at 7 a. m. and have another working day. Although this job is hard to do, I still alive. It means I can handle it.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to many medical researches, they show that cigarettes are harm for human. It may cause the disease of lung, moreover, may lead the cancer. That is why I think that cigarettes may even not be produced. Most worst of all, the container of cigarettes will make people addict to so it is hard for those who likes smoking to quit it. Nevertheless, more and more reports show that smoking is only harm for smoker but anyone who breathe smoke in. I think it is unfair for people, who don't smoke, be compelled to smoke. There is the only method to protect no-smokers, forbidding smoking in public. So the government tried to carry out a policy that all indoor space, including restaurant, should ban for smoking. We all know restaurant is a good place for all children, adults and older to relax and eat delicious dishes. If someone smokes beside you and you are a nonsmoker, can you still eat as nothing happen? Or you may shout with angry at the unpleasant man? I trust most will act like latter. Although the policy may cause unhappiness from smoker, I think it should not be given up. After all, it is about whole human's heath. Now that, we all know smoking will harm for us, why don't we agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants?",TWN
"I agree with the statement. Some people may think that there are demerits for students to do a part-time job. These people worry about that students spend a lot of time for the job and they will not have enough time to study. However, I think that their worry is nonsense. For, students know the importance of study, and they will study in vacant time. I think there is more merit of doing a part-time job than the demerit because of the following reasons. First, I think that doing a part-time job will help students' parents. Doing a part-time job makes students get extra money. Thanks to that extra money, some poor parents who cannot earn enough money for their child to go to college can let their children to go there. Second, doing a part-time job makes students promote independence from their parents in economical part, and they can realize the importance of money. Third, the most important reason I think, it is useful for them to experience job before they work at company. If they do a part-time job, they can take responsibility and get many skills for job, for example, greeting, conversation, presentation and so on. So, they will be able to work better than those who have never experienced a job. That's why I think doing a part-time job is important for students.",JPN
"When entering the college, the students' daily life has changed a lot, most of their time can be arranged by themselves. A large number of students choose to take a part-time job to fulfill their campus life. In fact, large part of their parents don't support them doing part-time jobs. In contrast, I maintain that it's important to have a part-time job. Firstly, the college students are innocent as they have never been touched with society. Through doing a part-time job, they can learn some practical skills what can't be learned from the class. On the other hand, an increasing number of companies need the employees equipped with working experience when they graduate from university to search for a job. What' more, they can make money by hard working to decrease their parents' burden. Also, it can teach them that it's not simple for their parents to earn money and develop a good habit of saving money. In reality, it's better for you to arrange when to buy and when to study, or it will have negative effects on your study. Above all, having a part-time job is to learn further working shills. Do not waste time on playing computer games or having a date. It is benefit to have a part-time job.",CHN
"Smoking is very dangerous for health, as it can damage your lungs. Due to the infection of lungs, aspiratory system also greatly affected.

It's a kind of drug, once you become its victim it's difficult for the person or the adductor to get rid of it. It's a bad habit that becomes permanent and not possible to throw it out from the life. As it is harmful for the people's health so it should be banned at restaurants. Peoples went to restaurants for eating good and healthy food and many take smoking as a fashion but because of the bad effect of smoking food don't remain healthy, as its smell and smoke get included in the food due to which people got ill.

"Merely, as other people think that smoking is not a good thing, I have the same mind. Smoking brings many bad effects to the person who does smoke or the people around as the passive smokers even for the environment. The main reason why it is should be banned, absolutely dealing with the health of the smoker itself. Cigarettes or tobacco that used contain lots of chemical approximately fifty items are known and a hundred are not, which are absolutely not good for heart and lung. Those chemical such as nicotine, tin, carcinogens etc can make those vital organ have to work harder than normal even damage the system of the organ. Especially, the chemical named carcinogens which may cause cancer. Second, the previous bad effect also can be happened to the person around the smokers. Since they do smoking indirectly, they breathe the smoke and the bad chemical go through out nose, throat to lung. They do not do smoking, but they have to pay for the bad effect of smoking. The last thing is it is not good for environment also, those chemical may cause the air pollution and make the ozone which is sort of tissues, a hole or tear the tissue. Then, it may result in global warming. Therefore, smoking should be banned, especially in nowadays where earth is damaged than ten years ago which is proved by global warming, the big universally enviromental matter that every humankind face as the people of the earth. I do agree with the government programme to forbid smoking in public places such as mall, university etc. and provide a certain room for smoking. Indeed, we cannot erase smoking instantly, yet, we can omit it little by little that may lead in a big change.",IDN
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons I think so. First we need much money to spend our life, for example, buying some clothes or playing with our friends or commuting from our home to our college and so on. If we don't have a part-time job, our parents have to pay for doing that. We owe spending our school life to our parents. The much money we use without having a part-time job, the more trouble they have. Second I think that having a part-time job become very nice experience for us. We didn't have so much time doing it because of club activities or study for entrance examination. Now, we can make more time before. Doing it helps us study about society and something helping us some day. Some people may say that we don't need doing it because we can learn it after we graduate college.

"Having a part time job imposes both positive and negative effects on a college student. On a positive perspective, working part time at a young age prepares a student for real life after schooling. He/she is trained to be more responsible as he/she progresses in his/her job. When a college student works part time, he/she also achieves a sense of fulfilment in what he/she does. Once he/she sees a pay check with his/her name on it, the sense of achievement he/she gets is unparalleled. Moreover, a college student who works part time can foresee and ultimately discover what career would fit his/her skills; if ever his/her skills do not fit his/her ambitions, he/she can then focus on developing the skills needed to match that ambition. Money-wise, a college student who has a part time job can easily assist whoever is financing his/her studies. On the other hand, working part time can also make a student less focused on his/her schooling. Although he/she is preparing himself/herself for the real world through work, a degree matched with honors and achievements is what an aspiring employee would need to get into a proper job. In addition, a college student may be discouraged to pursue his/her degree if he/she entertains the thought that the job he/she has can already sustain him/her.",PHL
"There are advantages and disadvantages about the issue whether to get a part-time job or not for college students. Personally speaking, I think it is a good chance to build teenagers' ability to be independent in economy from their parents and those who get a part-time job were offered a stage to see the differences between school life and adult life. It is also a test for them to find out the answer to these two questions: Were what I have learned provide myself enough skills to be stand out in the crowd? Am I really enjoy the classes that I majoring in college? After all, the experiences of life are what you really can learn. I think sometimes the things you can acquire in a part-time job are far more than words in the textbook or wisdom words that come out from the famous teacher but you can not get the true meanings in it because you are too young to know it. But being a student, you split time and energy involving in a job would cause certainly affects on your studies or relationships. Some parents think students should do and behave just like a student. They acclaim that teenagers in college---their only responsibilities are to study well and enjoy school life which is precious and could only being able to experience once. Some students want to invest themselves with as much knowledge as the can reach in college. Then, someday, these knowledge will make them special or have more advantages than others. To sum up, to get a part-time job or not, it depends, I think. Different reasons or backgrounds can decide a college student's will or thought about this question. To me, I will say YES for I want to explore more outside the school!",TWN
"After entering the Wuhan University, I find quite a few students take part-time at weekends. Their occupations range from giving out papers to private tutors. Is it really important for a college student to have a part-time job? I think it depends on different persons' different situations. One of my roommates always tried to get a part-time job. She believes that herself is an adult and has the responsibility to support her life. Actually, many students are eager to become independent and to prove his or her ability. As far as I am concerned, I take a balanced view towards this phenomenon. On the one hand, if one student can balance the work and study well, he can choose to have a part-time job which is within his ability. Besides, the tuition burdens of his parents can be shared. Nevertheless, when a part-time job will occupy the importance of study, this job is unnecessary and the student shouldn't afford the risk of taking it. After all, as a student, he or she needs to put the study at the first place. In short, we all need to keep calm at this crossroads. Think twice before we take actions is essential. If you think you can have the balance between part-time job and your study, you can have a try.",CHN
"As a college student in grade 2, I think to find some part-time job to do is an excellent choice. And I would like to present two explanations for this. The first reason can be seen by every person. There is no denying that we have been adults, that the reason why we need to shoulder the social responsibility. If we try some job in the free time, not only can we earn some money to reduce our family's burdens, but also the job time in the weekend can enrich our life. At the same time, I think if your weekends have too much spare time, why not choose this meaningful activity instead stay at dormitory and addict to computer games?On the other hand, by the time we do part-time job, it can also give us some experience about the out-side world. When we finish our 4-year study in college, we have to enter to the society in the end. In my opinion, the experience we accumulated during the part-time job will play an important role in future. In conclusion, I think to do some part- time jobs is the best choice for college students. In my class some boy have began to try to do some easy job, like put out ad paper. And I believe there are more and more college students select this way to practice ourselves",CHN
"Smoking has tended to dislike by many people since ancient times. These days its tendency seems to strong. It is said that to smoke brings no good and a lot of harm not for any smokers but also neighbors who do not any smoke. Furthermore, smoke that neighbors may take in their body is more dangerous than smokers breathe in. It is what is called Passive Smoking. Recently Japanese government suggests price of a smoke would be around 1, 000 yen. Newspapers search many people what was their opinion for government's suggestion. According to the results of an opinion poll, over fifty percents of people who answered questions did not oppose it. If price of a smoke rises, many smokers would stop smoking and then nonsmokers do not have to smoke regardless of grate hate. If we walk in a city, we would see many smokers. But we can escape from them. By contrast when we are in a restaurant, we cannot escape their smoke. Restaurants must be clean because there are the places where people eat or drink various foods. We might be harmed unconsciously with eating foods because smoke's smoke is likely very strong poison. From that reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",JPN
" As we all know smoking is hurt to our health. However, many people can not stop smoking, so some countries ban smoking in public places. But Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country ? I think the answer to it is yes. Because smoking maybe lead a health problem, smokers should not smoke in public places. If they do it in a restaurant, they may hurt others. Maybe smokers thinks they are just smoking at their own places, so it is not serious. But in facts they make a secondhand smoking to others, which has immediate harmful effects on a person's heart-and-lung system. To some degree, smoking in public places is a irresponsible behavior. So smoking should be completely banned. Last year, more than twenty of the fifty American states completely ban smoking in public places. In the year and a half before the ban, hospitals had three hundred ninety-nine admissions for heart attacks. In a similar period starting eighteen months after the ban, the number was two hundred thirty-seven. That was a decrease of forty-one percent. The example can show us completely banning smoking is something necessary. So completely banned at all the restaurants is a right act.",CHN
"Our society has many smokers. So today recognition about smoking was as much higher than the past. For example, the police are recently cracking down a smoker in non-smoking areas in Seoul. Most of smokers are easy to feel cumbersome what obey the law. For this reason actually cause stress for the smoker but it can't be helped for their health. I don't smoke but I don't think that smokers are being a bad man. I think that smoking is means to relieve stress for smoker. But smoking can causes harm to someone else. That is typical example is secondhand smoking. Secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. For this reason, I'm sorry for smokers but I hope to keep smokers and passive smokers' body in good condition. But you don't push the smokers too much stop smoking. It may produce a negative effect to smokers. The best way is to motivate smokers to stop smoking. Then they will stop smoking themselves easily. I've had a similar experience, too. When I forced to stop smoking, my father who was smoker thought nitpicking. But when I encouraged my father to stop smoking, he showed a favorable attitude to me.

"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First reason is that they need more and more money for various things. For example, clothes, CDs, DVDs and of course textbooks. But they cannot get money easily. So they will know the importance of money, and acquire the sense of money. Second, they will make many friends if they have a part-time job. They will be able to learn the way ob communication with other people. Third reason (I think this is the most important reason. ), college students should have experience the labor before they start to work in society in the future. Through a part-time job, they can learn the behavior and words toward their boss or seniors. If they work as home teacher and so on, they will be able to become more intelligence with their students. If they work in a first-food restaurant and so on, they will learn the behavior that make other people feel good. To be sure, some people say that they cannot have their own free time. And other people say that they have to be to blame for their work. But it is necessary to try to overcome those difficulties. Thus, it is very useful to have a part-time job.

When I visited the family restaurant the other day, I saw that smoke of the cigarette move non smoking seats from smoking seats. I feel unpleasantly because I hate cigarettes. Secondly, the cigarette spoils the cooking. The smell of the cigarette disturbs a smell of the cooking. I think that the smell is a big point for cooking. If smokers don't smoke while eating, they will understand true taste of the cooking. Finally, a smoking rate may fall. It is said that the cigarette is bad for our health. Furthermore it does harm to the person of the circumference. I think that healthy people increase if smoker decrease.

However, there is a discussion held by some people that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in china. To my own point of view, I strongly hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the public place. For starters, cigarette does not only do harm to the smoker's body, the smoke when the cigarette burning contends nearly all the poisons that the cigarette has, if you smoke in the public area like restaurant, the smoke would affect other person's health who don't smoke at all! At the same time, the smell of the smoke may make the surrounding clients feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, teenagers do not have a formed standard, they do not have a clear thought on what is good or not. If they thought it is cool smoking outside, they may firm the habit that they could not easily get rid of it since they are children.

In some restaurants that set at outdoor is acceptable to smoke at areas that far from people, but on the other hand in a restaurant with air condition the owner restaurant should be held smoking areas for smokers. Because the customers who do not smoke want to eat delicious food along with a good view and some people that allergic to smoke. I have opinion that the smokers should to reduce smoking and quit smoking in the finally because cigarettes did not have any benefit and they also make you and people around you got lung cancer.

This pattern of behavior appears even in a restaurant. Regardless of what the reason maybe, restaurant is the place where many people enjoy food and talk with their important person. Such place especially a restaurant; smoking should be banned at all in the country. There are lots of non-smokers as the number of smokers. Smokers have right to smoke whenever they want, but non-smokers have right to get clean air. In addition to this point, a restaurant is sensitive place since there is food area. If the nicotine which is contained in cigarettes infiltrates food, non smokers are exposed to bad effects of smoking such as carbon dioxide or other chemicals. Consequently, non smokers are indirect damaged from smoker's interoperated smoking. So for minimizing these losses, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",KOR
"I agree. The First, smoking can threaten the health. As a report, a cigarette contains more than, 000 different toxic or poisonous chemicals such as nicotine and carbon dioxide. This chemical ingredients threaten the health especially lung. Smoking leads not only smokers but also non- smokers to die. According to a survey, more than 50, 000 Americans die from secondly hand smoke (SHS) every year. Of those, , 000 American non-smokers die from lung cancer. Like this, not only smokers but also SHS could cause the lung cancer. Therefore the public smoking should be prohibited. Second, smoking can make the public space especially campus unpleasant environment. A poison gas and a harmful content of e cigarette can pollute the air of public space. The campus space must be a safe and pleasant environment for faculty, staff and students. Smoking in campus of the public space plays a role in causing unpleasant environment. As a survey at Utah State University about 80% of students would support a policy making the campus completely smoke-free. Most of the air pollutes the clean air of campus which is made of trees and then the students are not pleasant. Smoking in the public space especially campus should be prohibited.",KOR

In any public places should ban smoking too. Every one has the responsibilities to ban other people smoking in the public place.",TWN
"Is there any benefit of smoking? Tell me if there's any, otherwise, why shouldn't we ban it? No, we shouldn't. Cigarette contains thousands of chemicals. Most of them are harmful to humans. Lung cancer tops one of the most fatal diseases in Hong Kong. Cigarette, obviously, is the main killer. First handed smoking is harmful while second handed smoking is even more harmful. Restaurants always gather groups of people and the circulation systems installed are usually old fashioned. Because of the poor indoor air circulation, even smoking eaters are of small portion, the whole restaurant will soon be misted with smokes. Large portion of eaters is suffering from second handed smoking. This is an irresponsible behavior to poison others while you are poisoning yourself. To provide a clean, clear and non-poisoned eating environment, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Some may argue for exemptions in bars, discos and others. Eaters from these restaurants are mainly smokers but carcinogenic cigarette is still carcinogenic. Other non-smoking eaters and workers are still exposed to thousands of chemicals. Banning smoking at all restaurants is not against smokers, but to work for a better environment for eaters and workers as well as all of us.",HKG

For someone who want to have a lot of experience of doing jobs I think it is good idea to have a part-time job because it get both experience and money, but it is not good idea to so serious with part-time that it effects studying. If whatever reason make you have part-time jobs, the important thing that you should remind yourself is My present main job is studying and you should divide your time properly. You should select the part-time jobs that don't make you more tire. The part-time jobs that you select should be in your free time and your time must transcend for studying outside class. Moreover, it is good if you get a part-time job that is compatible with your major. For me it is not important to have a part-time job. Because I think that the most important thing that I must pay most of my attention now is studying and I should my best with my studying to get a great job in the future. In term of experience, college let students have a period to practice the job when the students are in year 4 of studying. I will get the experience when I reach that time.",THA

Their parents have tense about them and find a solution that how the can treat them and away them from the smoking. In many hotels we saw many youngs party do smoking. They do damage the society and atmosphere of the hotels. We need to change the youngs and stop them from this habit.

"I agree with this statement. One of the reasons for this is that collage students should understand the meaning of working. For example, if we have a part time job, we need to be punctual, to care of our appearance, and to greet everyone. So we can know the manner of working, and we can act fittingly as workers. Of course, when we graduate from college, we are regarded as workers by persons around us, and we are demanded to do as workers naturally. So we have to acquire the way of polite action by graduating from college. It is true that we can learn about etiquette as persons who live in society, in college group such as club activities, but we can experience how hard it is to get money only when we work in fact. In fact, from my experience of part time job, I realize that my thought about job was so easy. If I did not have a part time job, I would go out in society with wrong thought, face to unexpected hard society and be disappointed. Therefore, some people say that part time job is a just way of getting money, but I think that it is a important opportunity for us to learn what is important to work.",JPN
"Smoking is harmful to everybody. Those who like to smoke will hurt their families, friends and someone surrounding them, because secondhand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, they would cause lung cancer and heart disease. But those who like to smoke are difficult to quit the bad habit. When they smoke in a public place, the people around them would feel uncomfortable, smoking affects their health. The government has smoking completely banned in all public places. 90% of people support it, but smokers say that the law would deprive their rights. Its a really difficult problem. Maybe smokers could think over quitting smoking, it would be salutary to themselves and their families or friends. I am not a smoker, and I think, it is essential that smoking should be completely banned in public. The law prevents others from secondhand smoke's harm. The amount of fumes others smell and breathe in from smokers is really annoying. Ban smoking in public places doesn't deprive smokers' rights. On the other side, it protects others' right. Smokers will still have the right to smoke in their private space. And non-smokers will be free to smoke in public place. Isn't it a wonderful law?",TWN
"Before I start my argument, I will like to clarify that ""working"" and ""interning"" are different terms. We work with the sole intention of earning our keep, but we intern because we want to broaden our horizons. I do not agree that it is important for college students to work, even if it is just a part time job. Being college students, I believe that our primary job is to study well. Our parents send us to school with the hope that we will focus on what we have on hand, so that we will not be distracted by what is not something we have to worry about at moment. Besides, today's employers look for candidates with experience and credible degrees, not simply a determination that screams. Working will simply take our minds off studying. A healthy lifestyle at our age (as tertiary students) dictates us to study and play hard- we hardly have time to stress over work. In addition, Singapore's education is heavily subsidized, and there are many loan schemes that we can take up to lighten our parents' burden. All these initiatives gear towards putting our minds off monetary issues. I believe that the only way we can lighten our parents' load- is to simply work hard, excel in what we do to pave a bright future for ourselves. That being said, we should open ourselves to internships, because it complements our education and gives us a glimpse of an adult's working world. If what we do helps us to make new discoveries, then it is justified, because that is what ""Education"" is all about. If we are just working for the sake of earning money, then why not we focus on our studies now, do better in school so that we can earn more in future? ",SIN

For me I want to have a part-time job to but when I ask my parent may I have a part-time job and they just want me to study only. The problems are time, when you have part-time job you must sure that you could manage the time and you can study with a little time for it. But for me part-time job is good Because It can help you to know the cost of money and help you can practice your skill like if you good at playing music so, you can play music in pub as a part-time job, if you good at English so you can be a translator. The conclusion for me is part-time job is good for the one who can manger their time and have free time and bad for one whom have no time and not have responsibility.",THA

"These days, it is so hard to find a job, especially in country with very large number of population like Indonesia. In Indonesia, there are so many people who can not find a job though they have been graduated from university. There are so many people who have a smart brain and good marks in their school, but still have difficulties in finding a job. There are so many reason to explain why it can happened. One of them is because they lack the social skill that is the most important thing to work in real life. So that, it is important for college students to have a part time job. By this part time job, the students can have many experience in working and communicating with many kinds of people. It will give illustration of working in the real life. Moreover, nowadays, the job-finder will specialize the people who have more experience than the others. So it is important for college students to prepare their future life, by having a part time job. The other reason why it is important for college students to have a part time job is to teach the students to be mature. Because they are not children anymore, so it would be nice if they start trying to gain money. Gaining their own money, they also can help their parents and become a mature and independent self slowly.",IDN
"Part time job is a kind of job which is in addition to the job or business a person is doing to increase his income than expenses or to meet his expenses. For instance, a person is clerk in an office and he gets free in the afternoon and is known as clerk in his community. Now, if he starts another job like a mobile shop from after noon to night, he is doing a part time job. There is a need of part time job in two cases. First, a person doing part time job may run short of his income having more expenses. Second, a person who is not running short of income but wants to improve his life by getting car instead of a bike, house instead of living at rent, daily fruits rather than weekly eating etc. Part time job is hard job and always done with short time frame of mind. I mean people always start such jobs with an intentions to leave that job after achieving some temporary targets like marriages of daughters or studies of children etc. Most of the time part time job is not more than six hours and people are not professional in such jobs. It is common in the countries where inflation rates are high or people are showy. They want to meet the self created useless standards in the society and for that purpose they get into such jobs. There is a loss also that we can't pay time for the basic purpose of coming in this world that is to pray. Especially being muslim one should realize that we are to pray and to make others to pray also as no prophet to come now and we are responsible to preach the reason of being sent to this temporary world. In this context, part time job is just wastage of time, not always as someone doing in need, as people should control their desires.",PAK
"I believe that having a part-time job is important in the UK right now and I would dare to say, equally important in other regions of the globe. The world as we know it is undergoing great trials and tribulations financially at this time, with no quick end in sight. I would strongly urge all students to have some type of part-time work even if it's just doing a few gardening jobs, three or four times per week, to earn a few pounds. Printing money is not a viable solution because the market can only take so much before it becomes valueless. This is a time for creativity and providing service or fair exchange for money. If all of the students attending universities and colleges were to work a few hours every week, this would do wonders, not only for their local economy but also for their self esteem. Additionally, for those who's parents are funding their education, it would provide some financial relief for them and also forge stronger family bonds and earned respect for taking a proactive role in their lives rather than taking the low road, like some do, by just continuing to ask for and expecting, never ending handouts without a thought for what some parents might need to sacrifice in order to fund them.",ENS
"Nowadays, it is generally accepted that smoking is becoming more and more of a problem in our country. This phenomenon brings great damage especially smoking in the restaurants. So someone think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And someone doesn't think so. I prefer to the former one because I have some reasons below. There are many reasons accounting for my idea. On the one hand, smoking in the restaurant will damage their health and also other people's health. Most people know that smoking is harmful and can lead to many terrible diseases. It is not fair for people not smoke to get diseases because they sit together with smokers in the restaurants. So we must insist it. On the other hand, it will damage the environment. All the people want to eat in a clean restaurant. The unclean environment will make people unhappy and make the bad effect of you in the restaurants. So people will not like the restaurants if there are many smoking inside. Clearly, if we are blind to this problem, it is very likely that the restaurant will receive more and more complaints about smoking. We must pay attention to this problem.",CHN

It really isn't about the money because you don't get paid very much when you work part time, but the knowledge you can gain will be very valuable in your future, so I think that students are not wasting their time if they find part time jobs.

Advantages and disadvantages of working with college students. If you can earn money, you can buy things you need, pay your bills, have a place to live, and basically do things you want to do. On the contrary, because of the expense of students working part, this is not right. It is undeniable that the risk of part-time too many hidden. For example, employees do not have insurance, out of the accident are not guaranteed. Second, the wage trap and more inexperienced people are easily deceived. The most important hope that students have their own wage-judgment. Finally, I agree with the reasons students are working. They are being responsible and making sure that you can take care of yourself and they are creating a solid foundation that you can build on to have a successful future, too. All in all, workers must tell our parents or friends to go with experience. Safety first, self-protection and self-judgment of good and bad things to ensure their own safety.

"In my opinion, it is important for a college student to have a part-time job. Most students study in college for specific reasons. When it comes to the word ""college, "" we know it is the place where we gain further knowledge in a distinct field from. Some of us bury themselves into the academic, spending the most of their time trying to figure out something new or significant; however, most of the college students regard here as the place where we learn something more - the skills and abilities that would be required after we graduate, starting to find a job. What are the required skills then? Specific work position needs specific background knowledge and basic, even professional ability, such as accounting, management... etc. Along with the abilities above, great communication and social skills are also the crucial elements that make us good employees in the future. How do we learn these skills if they are not taught by any professors in our schools? Having a part-time job might be the best way. In a safe and not-so-complex working environment, students can learn how to deal with problems that are trickier than their math essays, and how to communicate with their supervisors or colleagues. In addition, since the part-time job is merely a part of a busy college student's life, they have to make the most of their limited time, they have to be more efficient, and they have to decide what their priorities are. To sum up, having a part-time job is a great way for college students to gain some useful experiences. These experiences do not only help us to have a glimpse of the post-graduate working society, but also help us to broaden the horizons and to be more caring.",TWN

" Personally, I totally agree with this statement. And I have two points here to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking in public places, such as restaurants, is really harmful to the public health. It is widely acknowledged that the second-hand smoking could do significant harm to the people around you.

Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurant is necessary and it can contribute to both the public health and showing our respect to others. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants can help to achieve a graceful environment for enjoying a tasty meal and communication. Apparently, in some cases, people go to restaurants for communication rather than food alone. And the stingy smell, such as smoke, can definitely disturb the atmosphere of talking. Anyway, banning smoking at all the restaurant does not indicate that it is inhuman or inconsiderate, having noticed in some restaurants that they provided the customers a rest room to handle their personal need for release themselves.

"In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer.

Then smoking during pregnancy can hinder to growth of fetus and may even result in death. Non-smokers soften suffer from eye and nose irritations, allergies and headaches as a result of inhaling smoke. Therefore smoking should definitely be banned so as to make in all the restaurant in the city a better place for everyone. We all know smoking in not healthy. Unfortunately, when smokers can smoke in restaurants, they can make other people sick. Of cause, banning smoking in restaurants will help non-smokers. It will also improve the smoker's health. It is a good idea to ban smoking in all the restaurant in the city because it can reduce conflicts. Non-smokers tend to get annoyed and jealous because smokers have an excuse to take frequent breaks. Thus, smoking cause numerous illnesses and banning smoking in all the restaurant in the city is a very good rule. It will increase productivity and reduce conflict.",THA
"I agree this idea. To have a job is to citizen's duty. I have a part-ti me job as a teacher at a cramming school now. I was taught manner by oth er teachers before I started working. This experience is useful for my d aily life and future. To make relationship with my students who I don't know anything is also valuable. When I think what I do to be believed b y my students, I think of myself objectively. So I can find my good and bad points, and think what I do to be a good person. Thus, to have a pa rt-time job is not only the way to get money but also precious experienc e. We can meet and help many people. I found it difficult to get money. So I make much of money better than before to start working. I save the money for my future. I'm making effo rts to get money for my purpose that I will live in Kobe. It is also imp ortant to make efforts for a purpose. I also want to thank to my parents for working for my family, because I knew the difficulty to get money.

"In the science museum, there have a exhibition for two lungs, one is a lung who smoke, the other is healthy one. You can see a lot difference between two lungs, the smoked lung is black and broken. This tell us smoking is not a good thing, smokers have the choice to smoke, the other people have the power to say NO. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Every time we choose a restaurant to have a date, we go on the internet search for its information, call the restaurant for booking, finally it's the time. You eating and chatting, for a while, there comes a person sit next to your table and start smoking. What should you do? People like to do the things whatever they want, but sometimes the things you do may hurt yourself and others. For your friends and other people, if you want to smoke you can go outdoor the restaurant. Smoking should be banned because some of the people only think about themselves, there should have laws to tell them not to do. For our good health the best way is don't touch the cigarette.",TWN
"I agree that it's important, but just not very practical these days. I understand that a lot of kids are doing it hard and struggling financially. However I think that they would be better off spending ninety-five percent of their time on studying. The reason that I think that is because jobs are hard enough to get now as it is and there are loads of people down at the local employment centre every week day now who have families to feed. Throwing more competition for them, like groups of students looking for part-time jobs, only makes it harder because a lot of companies will see a chance to get some cheap college labour rather than having to pay adult rates to older individuals. This may sound rather strange coming from a teacher and I understand the student's position, but I also understand the current economy too. If it comes down to prioritizing, then I think that we must keep the wage earners, who have to support their families, in mind first. On the other side of the coin, I know that a lot of students are fairly resilient and tenacious so, I think that they will still fair well. I certainly believe that their grades would improve and in the long run, provide them with better and more rewarding employment.",ENS
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. College students should have a part-time job because it is good for college students in any ways such as developing socializing skills and getting social experience. Firstly, college students should have a part time job because it may be developing socializing skills. Training a part-time job needs to have effectively speaking skill, especially when the trainer serves the customer. The trainer has to be polite in term of verbal and non-verbal skill to make the customer satisfied good serve. Practicing politely to the customers can make the trainers developing socializing skills because they know how to act toward the group of people who come to use the service. Different customers can be different kind of people. It is necessary for college students or others who work a part-time job that they have to respond or serve the customer appropriately by recognizing many factors which are suite to the individual. Additionally, college students who have a part-time job can gain social experience. Working a part-time job may be make trainer's world view widely because they can see, learn and know what things they do that. Also college students can learn something quickly, so that it is important to support them learning more and more. As you can see that training a part-time job is important for college students in few ways that while they are working the job they can develop socializing skills and gain more social experience.",THA

For college students those students who are well-mannered or have a better understanding about concept related to the subject or good qualification. They give the tuition of the school level students or some students works in the shops as a part time job. Some students sell newspaper as a part time job.

"Currently most public places had banned smoking by law. The only areas for smokers to smoke are in the ""yellow box"" or the ""smoking cubicle"". This is a good decision make by the government as it shows that the government are aware of the health implications on the general public and are taking action to protect them. It will be good to have a complete ban of smoking in restaurants as it will allow the customers to have clean air. Even with the smoking cubicle that is isolated from the main area, the smoke can still travel to the main area since air cannot be controlled. The residue left by the cigarette is dirty and make the place looks unsightly. Smoking will affect the hygiene of the restaurants too. As explained earlier, the residue is very dirty. If customers see the residue on many parts of the floors in the restaurants, it will give n impression that the owners did not clean the place and will defiantly affect the experience felt by the customers. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants. It will cause inconvenient to the smokers; i believe they will understand when they understand the reasons behind it. The public will benefit the most from such as ban. ",SIN
"When I am in restaurant, I can usually smell that someone is smoking but I can't say anything at all, and many people have the same feeling as me, so many people think the government should publish a law to ban smoking in restaurant, I have a mixed idea about it. It is obvious that people smoking will influence the people around him. But we can ban completely smoking in restaurant as a people not smoking; we should consider the feeling of people smoking. First, we can build a special room in restaurant for people to smoke, the idea will meet people's need of smoking and the smoke will not influence people's dinner. Before the special room being built, people can smoke in toilet or beside the junk barrel. After the law being published, if any people smoke in the restaurant and influence the other people's eating, in restaurant, the waiter should advise them to go to the special room for smoking politely and if the smokers are rude and continue to smoke influencing other people, waiter can reveal the law to them for money. Generally speaking, the smoker can smoke in the restaurant, but they should smoke in the toilet or special room and guarantee they will not influence other people.",CHN
"Nowadays, more and more college students think it is of great value and necessity to get a part-time job. For me, I am also one of them. I fully agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning much money. What values more is the experience you get to promote your capacity such as communication, independence, your solution to an issue, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity to be involved in the society, forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time that your may feel stressed. So you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life.",CHN
"Nowadays, it is not uncommon to see university students doing part-time jobs. And I don't think it is important for students to have a part time job because of several reasons. Pursuant to a research done by The Chinese University of Hong Kongs, university students who take part-time jobs have shown a decline in their studies as they are often distracted away by their jobs, some may even make truant a habit since they are tired after working. Also, some may argue that students who have part-time jobs can earn money by their own, thus can become financially independent and help to relieve financial burdens of their families. But it is not the case. As many student who have part-time jobs seldom pay the tuition fees by themselves, they would rather use their money earned to buy luxury and pricely products which their parents can hardly afford. So, their parents still need to pay for their tuition fees and give them pocket money. This will make students becoming more and more materialism and brand-addicted. Lastly, students may become demotivated in studying. When they have a part-time job, their timetable will be so tight that don't even have time to hang out with friends, and they will be eventually disconnected with their friends and feel isolated. Hence, they may lose motivation to study as they are not happy wth their school and social lives. Therefore, I don't think it is important for university students to have part-time jobs.",HKG
"Part time job is an investible part in my college days. Since I studied in University, I have taken many kinds of jobs during the college days. From waitress to tutor, there are so many jobs I have done that sometimes I couldn't remember all of them. For me, there are some reasons why I took so many part time jobs and what part time jobs mean for me. First, I have to earn my own livings. Since my families don't have the ability to support all of my life expenses, I have to make some money to support my own life. Therefore, I took many jobs to earn enough money for life. Second, I can have different experiences and learn some things from them by taking different jobs. Since I have done many kinds of jobs, I have learned different experiences from them. For example, I learned how to cope with my tutor students and the teaching skills in the tutor jobs. In addition, I also learned how to treat customers in a suitable way when I was a waitress. These experiences are really meaningful for me. The last reason is that I can make different kinds of friends from different jobs. And it's really interesting to have some chats during the working time. Part time jobs take a great part of my college life. Though I feel tired or frustrated because of them, I can't confess that I do learn a lot and get mature from these experiences. Therefore, I really can't imagine if I haven't done any part time job, what my college life will be.",TWN
"I don't know why there is a kind of thing called cigarette in the world. Yes, I don't like it more than I can imagine. But why do people smoke, especially in the public? This activity may disturb people around the smoking man, not only because the horrible smell but the hurt it may cause to our health. So it's necessary to set up some statutes. What's the most extensive public spot in the country? I must say it's more than one, such as the park, the plaza, the square and the restaurant. But when we discuss the ban on smoking, the restaurant is stand in the breach. Because restaurants are full of people, and obviously people are eating in the restaurant, so if someone is smoking next you, you'll get the harmful smoke into your with the movement of eating. But when we look back, we'll notice the disagreement from the smokers. They said that smoking shouldn't be banned because smoking has been a part of their life. After hearing these words, I think it's become more important to ban smoking. The cigarettes become the necessary part? So the situation is serious, and we must strangle it when some young people haven't drop into the abyss. What's more? There has been a great increase in casualties in fire accidents caused by smoking in recent years. And we have also seen the ground littered with cigarette ends. Thus smoking proves to be a source of pollution for the environment and a major threat to life and property. One person always belongs to the society. The individual benefit must be subordinated to that of the society. Besides, smokers can also benefit from this ban which helps them get rid of smoking. So let's put this ban into practice soon.",CHN
"China is becoming a country which has many college students and the school fee is rising sharply. So nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. On this phenomenon, I just have my own opinion. Though to have after-school work has brought a lot of problems. For example, part-time jobs often distract students' attention from their studies, so some students have shown a decline in their studies, and some even play truant. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and learn what is needed for the development of our society. But On the other hand, it helps to build independence in young people and make them more mature, and students who have part-time jobs can relieve the economic burdens of their parents. Most college students have been spoiled by their parents, and even their grandparents. So some of them can do nothing and can't sustain the pressures and stress. To have a part time job can help those students to adapt to society more easily, learning how to communicate with others and how to protect themselves. Some students who have part-time jobs may relieve their parents' economic burdens. The most important is that, to have a part time job can gain skill points. A graduate who only have high scores but no experience is not a real talent so that I just agree the topic about whether it's important for college students to have a part time job.",CHN
"I think it is extreme to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. I also don't like people smoking in the restaurants but smokers have the right to smoke. If we ban smoking in the restaurants, it means smokers have little place to smoke while eating. It also means that the restaurants smokers can eat freely decrease. Some people think smokers can smoke outside the restaurant and smokers can tolerate smoking while eating but for smokers it can be a torture not to smoke. Non-smokers have a right to eat in fresh environment but I think smokers have the right to smoke, too. I think if there are some places for smokers in the restaurants, it can be helpful. It is good for both non-smokers and smokers. Smokers can smoke in the smoking only places and non-smokers can enjoy the meal in fresh air. For example, I went to coffee-bean cafÃ© with my friend one day and there was a smoking place in the cafe. I could enjoy my time without smokes from cigarettes and smokers smoked in that place. I think it is good way to consider both sides- non-smokers and smokers. Instead of banning smoking completely, I think by making smoking areas in the restaurants can be one solution.",KOR

"Do students need a part time job? Yes, I think so. This will not only help them financially but also personally. The material benefit of having a part time job is money. The money earned through this journey will help in paying for the tuition, rent, and other financial needs of the student. This is the material benefit, but what about the personal benefit? Through working hard, students become more responsible with their money, and their personality. Students don't want to spend their hard-earned money on useless things, so they'll become wiser on how they spend their money. How about the personality? Through working with other colleagues or customers they become more socially-capable. It will help them in the future when they are looking for a read job. It would prepare them for the real world will throw at them. However, having part time jobs will also have its flaws. The time does it start? This can affect the academics of the student. Is it safe?

"I think that smoking should not only be banned all the restaurants in Japan but also in all the restaurants everywhere in the world. Smoking is a leading cause of cancer in people under 50, and smoking causes tar to build up in the lungs. This means that people who smoke cannot perform in athletic activities or have as much energy as people who keep their longs in their bodies healthy. Smoking also takes years away from your lifetime, and I have heard that every cigarette you smoke can shorten your life by as much as 7 minutes. This doesn't seem like a lot, but if you smoke one pack of cigarettes every day, you take nearly 2 hours off your life every day, and if you continue this for a whole year, you will have shortened your life by approximately one month. With these numbers, I think it is easy to see that it is a good choice to quit smoking. By banning smoking in restaurants, and by banning smoking in restaurants in Japan, we can promote the good health of people, and we can teach our children healthier habits and styles of living. For these reasons, I think it is a good idea to ban smoking at restaurants in Japan.",ENS
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is bad for health, and even more so for second-hand smoke. For the benefit of non-smokers, Singapore currently bans smoking in all indoor, air-conditioned establishments, such as restaurants, shopping malls, corporate buildings, etc. Even for the non-air-conditioned areas like the hawker centres, almost the entire premise is banned from smoking, except for a small corner which is designated for smoking. The ban of smoking at all the restaurants in the country will help to alleviate the negative effects of second-hand smoke faced by non-smokers, and discourages the smokers to smoke, as it is made inconvenient for them to do so. The ban might, initially, be faced with objections from smokers, as it will be inconvenient for them to smoke, but in the long run, will be beneficial for themselves as well as the society as a whole. In addition to the ban in all restaurants, campaigns could be carried to advocate the harmful effects of smoking to discourage smoking and helps smokers to stop smoking. In the long run, besides the restaurants, the ban could cover more areas like those covered in Singapore. For the ban to be effective, the penalties and enforcement have to be appropriately carried out as well. ",SIN
"As a college student, it is important to have a part time job. It have many benefit for them. The first benefit is it can up his / her experience about working before they have a real job. Students will need to know how they act at work place, what they must do, and how they use their ability at work. And they need to know too how they talk with the boss, what they need to do to earn a raise, and learn a socialism at their work place. The second benefit is to help their parents about school funds. Have a part time job can help students to decrease their parents works, or to up his month income. It is useful for them that live in poor families and have low month income. The third benefit is it can help the preparation of a student before they have a real job. So students will not surprised when they feel something different from working.

I think, through we try new things, include experience of part-time jobs, we will understand social systems and learn many ways.

"I can't agree with the idea. I think that study is more important for college students than having a part-time job. Of course, if college students could do both hardly, it was best. But most of them, at least around of me, can't do so. Especially, students of national college are given a lot of money by country for going to college and studying. Therefore I think they must study hard to become the people who are helpful for doing something. Sometimes I heard the opinion saying like following. College students should have a part-time job because it gives them many experiences to live social. I think doing various things is good for young people, too. But, at the same time, I think it is ridiculous to have part-time job that spends a lot of times though all of the rewards are just money. Seen in long span, it must be good for college students to study hard about their specials than spend their precious time on a part-time job. Studying is making their career. If they must pay their college fee by themselves, they should do some part-time job. But, if their parents or country do so, they should have a part-time job to live or to study not to play.",JPN
"Nowadays, it is increasingly popular for a college student to make a part time job in their spare time. From my point of view, I'm quite in favor of this kind of practice. My reasons are as follows. In the first place, we college student are adults. We have the responsibility to support ourselves financially. We are no longer children taking it for granted that parents should pay for whatever we ask for. We should get what we want by ourselves, or at least, partially. Parents won't support us financially for good, so why not make an attempt to make money independently. In the second place, to make a part time job also contribute to our process of maturity. Compared with the campus, the workplace is much closer to the society. The society will surely teach us what the campus can't. Since it is often said that the campus is a society in miniature, so where else can we learn more than in the fierce, dignified society? In the third place, to make a part time job can make us have a better understanding of the essence of making a living. We should bear in mind that money is never made easily and that it is really difficult for our parents to support a family. Since we became adults, it is no longer necessarily for them to keep supporting us financially, they just do this spontaneously. We should be grateful. All in all, to have a part time is highly desirable for college student. I hope all the college students can have a try. Should we even fail, we wouldn't lose anything.",CHN
"Smoking laws have always been a hotly debated topic in Singapore. It is true that smoking is detrimental to the health of the smoker and everyone around, but the smoker also argues that it is in his own right and freedom in which he choses to do what he wants. As smoking bans are popping up virtually everywhere in the country, smokers find it more and more difficult to find places where they can smoke, legally. This is actually the intended effect of the government --- for smokers to smoke less/stop smoking because of the huge inconvenience factor. Referring to smoking bans in restaurant, I believe that following the general smoking ban requirements; all indoor restaurants should completely ban smoking. It is unfair for other guests to put up with the smoke and subject their health to risks simply because of other inconsiderate smokers. In fact, a large number of non-smokers actually detest the smell of smoke. However, pertaining to individual rights, I believe that some outdoor restaurants could cordon off an area for smokers. This way, both sets of people have a right to do things which are of their interest. Therefore, I do not believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. ",SIN

There are many reasons for this opinion, first is to keep the nutrition and the sterilize of food in the restaurant, because the smoke of cigarette causes air pollution in the restaurant, so it make the air isn't comfortable and the customer will fell disappointed. The second reason is not all people like smoking. Then, the smoker must respect to the other who does not like smoking, because both of active smoker and passive smoker is worse effect of passive smoker. Passive smoker who only inhale of smoke cigarette. The third reason is to decrease the high level of risk smoking, because as we know smoking causes many risks and can shorten our life.

"There are many debates about smoking, but a debate if smoking should be allowed in public areas is the most controversial these days. Many restaurants have adopted the idea of separating seats according to smoking, but there are still people who want smoking bannned completely in restaurants. I agree that smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the name of law. First of all, it is said that secondhand smoking causes more serious health problems, . Especially, the effects towards pregnant women and young babies are disastrous. According to several statistics, the chance of suffering from lung cancer is higher if nonsmokers breathe in smoke. Who is going to compensate this person's health? Would smokers do that for non-smokers? Definitely not. Legal methods are needed to decrease the dangers of secondhand smoking. The second reason is that smoke can make people lose appetitie. Even though the seats are separated in restaurants, the smell can spreadout through the air. For instance, a man ordered a steak and he is about to have that one delicious bite. Then suddenly, a person at the next table started smoking. . The smoke eventually comes to their table so the smell distracts them from eating their meal. People say smoking in places they want are smokers' rights. What about the rights of non-smokers then? The best way to protect these two sides is to ban smoking in restaurants completely in the country and to build places solely for smoking.",KOR

But in my side, if students can do the part-time job and manage their time together, it is great. Student can find some new experience outside the class.

"When you list the serious problems of the all restaurant, the subject of smoking is right up there with the big ones. Smoking is annoyed for many people in restaurant. Many people think that smoking in restaurant is loutish. Smoking in restaurant, it causes lung cancer, heart disease and may complicate pregnancy. Smoking not only smelly and foul the taste of the food and image of the restaurant is not too good. A smell from a cigarette will combine with a smell of food. That will be the end of the restaurant. The law should make this problem disappear. Like it or not, it's inevitable that smoking will be illegal in all restaurants. This law takes effect for all restaurants. If you go inside a restaurant and the only thing you see is a smoke. Do you still want to have some meal there? Imagine that you have some food in front of your face and you are going to put something in your mouth. Then some people that sit next to your table take out a cigarette and stir up. The waiter may not see everything in the restaurant clearly which can cause an accident even to the waiter or to costumers.",THA
"Today, more and more college students tend to have a part-time job. Is it good or bad? As far as I am concerned, it depends on the time you spend in doing it. If you spend proper time on it, you can benefit a lot form it. Firstly, doing a part-time job can enrich the students' social experiences. He will meet all kinds of people in his job and during this period, he learns how to deal with them. This can improve his ability in communicating with others. What's more, it's not until a student makes money by himself will that he knows that making a live is not an easy thing. And in this case, he will be more understanding towards his parents and learn to arrange his money properly. However, it also has disadvantages if you spend too much time on it. For our studying time can't be guaranteed. For us students, studying is our major duty and once you have a part-time job, the problems in your job will make you cannot be absorbed in your major study fully. So, just as each coin has two sides, doing a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. It's all up to you whether you can really learn something from it.",CHN
"Nowadays smoking is one of the most problems in the social because of the increasing of the smoker even though they have campaigns about stop smoking but it does not accomplish much. From the research some of the smokers think that smoking is good for their mild such as decreased themselves or their look to be more cool. Actually smoking affects many bad things. The smoking is incredibly bad for your health and for people who smell the smoke. I think smoke is really bad for example health of the smokers that will look worse and worse, surround people because the smoke from there will cause other people health to become like the smoker himself, for environment that cause air pollution and the lost is waste your money. Many people spend too much money on cigarettes. I saw many of smokers order sweet cigarettes from other countries. It's very worthless for daily life. From the most of people think that smoker is really bad even though smoker think that it good for them more or less. They won't see any disadvantages since they are still strong. If someday they become sick because of cancer, they will regret about that. So we have to think of the way to help them stop or lessen the smoking habit for decreasing the smoker.",THA
"Some people may think that smoking is a behavior, symbolized as a mature person. Some people may think that when they are smoking, they can release their stress and heavy burden for a while. However, smoking is harmful to not only smokers' health but also others'. Therefore, it is actually not mature if you smoke in order to look mature. You do not care about your health. Besides, you do not care about the people around you. The real mature people will take care of themselves and others, because health is the pyramidal cornerstone of life. In addition, if you want to release yourself from tension and stress temporarily, you can chat with friends, see a movie, listen to music, have a journey and so on. There are lots of things can replace smoking. Since smoking can do nothing but do harm to everyone's health. Let's just quit it. It is hard to quit it, nevertheless, if you have been addicted to it for a long time. It is like the drug which makes you very uncomfortable when you do not take it. Worse yet, you may go crazy. At this moment, all you need to do is to keep your perseverance. As long as you stick to it and pass the most difficult time, you will win the better life.",TWN
"I think that a part time job is important for college students. Maybe a college students who doing part time job is very busy, so he or she is not enough time to study and get a not good grade.

And later when he of she is choose his or hers profession, that is very helpful. We don't know about career well. We just learn theory of major. So we know the theory but don't know how to use the theory in job. A part time job is able to desolve that problem. You can use your theory in work. And a part time job is increase the independence. The biggest reason of doing a part time job is the make money. If you make money to part time job, you can financially independene of your parent. Maybe the pay is very little. But you feel very proud of you because you make money by yourself. So I think a part time job is very important for college students.",KOR
"I think so too, because having a part-time job benefits us. Through doing part-time job we can learn many things we need to learn. The first thing is what we can become polite. When we do part-time job, we have to work as a clerk of a store or company. So, we have to greet, talk to consumers politely. We can learn the manner which we have to get in the future. If we don't have this manner, we could not get job. The next thing is responsibility. We have to be responsible for our task, because part-time job is not play. This responsibility is necessary after we graduate from college and when we start to work for company. Then, we can learn how important money is. We do hard works and get money. This hard works tell us the importance of money. It isn't until we get money we earned that we realize the really value of money. Through the part-time job, we can experience our society and realize what our society is. We can become a member of our society. Moreover, college students have much free time. College is not as busy as high school. We college student should make the most use of this free time. It is best time to do part-time job.

"In my opinion the government should not ban the smoking in the public places especially in the restaurant. Firstly the cigarette manufacture has a high participation of making high income for the financial of our country, Indonesia. It is not only used for the government but also for fulfilling the needs of all aspects that are faced by the government, like education, housing, governor and many things. It means that decreasing the using of the cigarette will bring to the decrease of income also. And it will make Indonesia will be worst. Restaurant is one of the places that people are used to visiting to when they get bored. So they want to do something that will refresh their brain after having a lot of work activities. Based on research that conducted by one of the doctors, having smoking is able to make the body of the human being healthy. Furthermore, if the restaurant have the route that the visitors should hot smoking there, it will decrease the profit of the owner because the visitors will also decrease. Unemployment is one of the big problems that are faced by the government of Indonesia. When government decides to ban the using of smoking in public places especially in the restaurant, it will decrease the demand of the cigarette. It means that the production of the cigarette will also decreasing and the owner will fire the employment out. So that's why the number of unemployment will be increase. In brief, the government should not ban smoking in the public places especially restaurant because it has many disadvantages not only for the human but also for the government itself because the number of restaurant in Indonesia is very high.",IDN
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons for my opinion. I think that we have good experience by a part-time job. This is a reason that I begin to start a part-time job, because I think that this is very good social study. My part-time job is restaurant. I thinks that experience of the service industry is useful for an occupation of future. I think that a burden of parents decreases. Actually, I use my salary of part-time job for the cost of living and I don't get some money by my parents. I think it is easy to use my salary and use various things. We can travel abroad and study various things, buy likely things by my salary. The last reason is very personal reason. I belong to baseball club. Baseball club costs money. For example, we go to the camp in every spring and summer. A baseball article is very high. Uniform, spikes, a glove are more two hundred yen. Many my friends belong to various circle. Some circle costs money, too. I think that we should have a part-time job, because if we want to do various things at college students, we need much money.",JPN

"We are university students. It is important for us to have a part-time job! Certificate is a MUST to those going to purse sparkling futures. Yet, working experience weighs as heavily as certificate. A computer not only needs well-designed hardware, but also up-to-dated software to support. Working experience is similar to software to computer. Working with others, students are able to develop their soft skills and improve personality to be all-round people. This benefits everyone no matter how good or bad one performs academically. Most of the time, dealing with interpersonal issues is more complicated than solving mathematical problems because people always change minds. University students are believed to be well equipped with knowledge. So, to further succeed in the future, students should behave more mature, responsibly and independently. And certainly we cannot practice these by reading textbooks. Besides experience, money is always a big issue for students. Joining societies or language courses, hanging out with friends, dressing more nicely for some reasons etc. all need money. We are not teenagers anymore. Asking money from parents for everything is certainly not a responsible and mature way. In order to pay for all entertainments we want to join, getting a part-time job is obviously the best way out. Fun usually comes with price. Also, it is the first step for self- finance. We, being university students, are preparing and upgrading ourselves to fight in the world few years later.

"Smoking has been a socially acceptable habit for the longest time. And yet personally, I do not think that society has got this one right. Not only is smoking accompanied by a string of health-related issues that one does not realize usually until he or she turns 40, it stains your teeth and fingernails yellow. There is also a conception among youths that smoking is tied to one's ""cool"" factor among peers, and that one cigarette in your hand somehow gives you an extra edge to your personality. Personally, I have never heard of greater hokum than that, but I cannot deny the fact that there are a sizeable group of teenagers out there who think that personality and charisma are a result of the cigarette packets in their pockets. We can never understand the brilliance of teenagers can we? However, I must admit that scientific evidence, as it currently stands, are at loggerheads as to whether the effects of smoking are truly hazardous as the media claims. Perhaps one reason the media in almost every country in the world, including Singapore, has sought to prevent the advertisement of cigarettes, is that of a health policy reason by the government. For example, the population in Singapore cannot afford to fall ill due to copious amounts of smoking, and become a burden unto society. Moreover, the importance of a healthy workforce, which is inextricably tied to a productive workforce, could have been an especially crucial consideration among parliamentarians in Singapore when they debated about the general stance against smoking.

"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is true that there are some bad aspects to have a part-time job for college students, for example, we use a lot of time for part-time job so we don't study or we sleep in the class. But there are more good aspects to have a part-time job. I raise three reasons that I think so. First, we can know how difficult to earn money and how important money is. Many of us are depend on our parents in terms of economy, so we don't know how difficult to earn money. Having a part-time job tells us how difficult. And understanding it leads us to respect our parents. Second, we can get new skills that we can't get at college. I think having a lot of skills, even if it seems that those skills are not important; will be useful in the future. Third, we get the opportunity to talk with adults to do a part-time job. We can get a lot of information and knowledge. I think a lot of knowledge leads us happy. In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.

"In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause allergic coughing to many people. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it which may later develop into a habit. Smoke which arises when a person smokes a cigarette, bide or cigar is more hazardous to a passive smoker who inhales the smoke being in close vicinity of the active smoker. The smoke being inhaled by the former is unfiltered thereby causing more ill effects. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and last but not the least carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. Even the advocates of smoking in public areas disapprove of the practice when it comes to their off springs. Witnessing the elders smoking kindles similar desire in a youngster thereby giving birth to a new generation at smokers. To avoid these evils of smoking and ensure a healthy platform for the youth it is not only our duty but need of the day to condemn such practices if not completely then at least socially. At last, I would say, smoking is a dangerous, it is always better to keep our next generation as a way as possible for us. Banning it at public places is a must to keep our country healthy and glomming.",THA
"I agree this opinion. This is because, at first, smoking isn't good for our health. As we know well, smoking people can catch cancer of lung. Cancer is the most in the cause of death by disease. So, I think it's better not to smoke. Secondary, like restaurant, smoking is annoying to me. Especially, the smog of cigarette ""enter"" my body, and it damages my health. For example, in my case, only being in the smoking section, the frequency of my coughing becomes pretty high!! And in bad case, I come to have a headache, so I can't sleep well at night. (and very sleepy at school) In other words, including some same matters first reason, smoking damages not only people who are smoking, but also people who are around cigarettes, that is, none smoking people like me. So in the place which the window is closed, like restaurant, is easy to damage our body and health. Recently, what is called ""walking cigarette"" is taken in the news program. It also hurts the health of children. So, I am for the opinion. And, I want people who smoke, to pay attention to others around them.",JPN
"When college life starts, students enter in a new phase of life. College life is quite different from school life. Moreover the expenditures are too increased. Some of the parents can not afford the academic expenditures, so, they do not permit their children to get education. But students with good academic records and those who are keep to get educated, they start part time jobs, to fulfil their expenditures along with studies. But, I totally disagree to it. Though on one hand, its useful that in a way students can help out their parents, even though, I disagree with this, because students are the main pillars society. They are the backbone of our progress. So, they should give their full time and potential to studies. If they, start part time jobs, then no doubt, it would be rather more difficult for them to manage both their jobs and studies. In this way they couldn't give their best in any one of them. Infect, they will be tired and frustrated. The timing work will exhaust them and they will fail to cope with their studies. As a result they will be in-efficient and will show worse results in college. The life of a students is the golden time of their life.

"As a non-smoking person, I totally agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for our health, not to speak the second-hand smoke. When having food in a restaurant, people seek for comfort and relax. For this reason, no one is willing to be bothered, especially bothered by uncomfortable smell. In Taiwan, smoking is banned at most restaurants. Therefore, we have already taken it for granted. However, when my last trip to China, I can tell how important the topic is. Unlike Taiwan, wherever you have your meal in China, there is a kind of smell surrounds you--smell of smoking. After this terrible experience, I realize how important the topic is, for second-hand smoke does really bad to our health and our lungs. In my opinion, smoking is a really harmful habit, because it not only hurt the people who smoke, but others surround them. Besides, second-hand smoke is much more harmful to our human body. In order to have a healthy body and have a pleasure atmosphere when eating, we have to do our best to completely ban smoking at all the restaurant in Taiwan.",TWN
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. It is true that they have less time to study what they are interested in due to having a part-time job. So they can't study enough. But I don't necessarily think so. This is because they can learn a lot of things, which they can't learn in colleges, and communicate many people through a part-time job. Furthermore they can buy books, clothes and other things by having a part-time job. For example, if you work at a restaurant, you can learn a service and cooking. If you work at a remover, you can strengthen your muscle. So the more occupations they experience, the more things they learn. Besides, what they learn through a part-time job is far more useful than what they learn in colleges. The money which they earn by a part-time job enables them to do a lot of things. For instance, they can go to class where they learn how to use a personal computer. And they can make a trip. They can buy comics, videogames and CDs. In other words, they can enjoy their hobbies by earnings which they get through a part-time job. In my opinion, college students have to have a part-time job to develop themselves as a member of society and to know how hard it is to earn the money. That's why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"I don't agree with this statement that college students should have a part-time job because I feel that they have many other priorities that should come ahead of whatever small money they might be able to make by having a part-time job. Students who flounder their time on part-time work will undoubtedly find that their grades are slipping, and this is something that can affect their entire future because once you get some bad grades, it is very difficult to bring your GPA back up. Of course many companies would like for students to have a part-time experience, but a good GPA is also a good way of showing that you are responsible and hardworking. I think that students should be able to have the liberty to take the time after graduating to learn more about being really serious in working, so they should save part-time employment for immediately after graduation or for maybe in the summers when they don't have as much to do. Therefore, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job as any benefits they might gain will be offset by the gains they will make after graduation and enrollment in the industry.",ENS
"I believe part-time job is not necessary for us college students. Firstly, in the college, acquiring knowledge is the main point. College is not the end of the study, on the contrary, it is just a new start of life. We need to study and live with our own. Most of us are not short of money, because our parents could support our basic life. So, finding a part-time job and affording our life are not the most important things. Also, part-time job in college can not bring us a lot of money, while, if we study hard, we may use our knowledge to create much more wealth in the future. Secondly, the society is much more complex than we considered. What we have learnt about and our experience are not enough, we may possibly be cheated when we try to find a part-time job. What's worse, our equity could be encroached on. That's not worth the candle. Thirdly, if we want to do the part-time job for working experience, we can choose the student union or some other organizations founded by college. It's safe and efficient. Also, we can ask for volunteer work, we ought not to think too much of money. Volunteering is always a great way to get progress for us students. Having taken all into consideration, for some whose family has financial burden, part-time job may be a good choice. But for most of us, I think part-time job is unnecessary. Studying hard is the most important thing, without 'one of'.",CHN

I agree with part time job and it is best idea for pool student. However study is the most important than part time job. It have time enough should make, but if not time should not make. Sometime working part time cannot help them, because working help look for money only, but it cannot help good study. If we look into point important of part time job, for example, look for money, using time and save money. After finish work them must do homework and get up to university working part time can make them have not time enough study.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, there are several reasons to support my answer. First, restaurants are public occasions, foreigners may have their dishes in several of these places, if too many people smoke, will leave bad impressions in their mind, and so that hurts views of our country. Second, it is same as I say, restaurants are open to everyone, of course, and mother-to-be, children, and the old are their customers. The chemical substances make by smoking will do severe damage to them, especially the mother-to-be, her baby get hurt at the same time. Furthermore, children may learn smoker's behavior unconsciously; it will make a big influence on them. Third, smoking sometimes may cause accidents. Throw tobacco leaf casually may give rise to a fire. The loss of a fire can't be count, if people get damage or more severe hurt, no one can be responsible for this accident. The damages to the smokers make by smoking can't be avoided obviously; however, it is unreasonable to ask other people take risks with them. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",TWN
"Yes, I firmly believe that a part-time job is necessary to the college students, even if the others do not agree. Here are some reasons which can prove my conclusion. First of all, we can earn some money from having a part-time job. When on campus, we still need our parents' supports. We need money for life and study. So, once having a job, we can relieve our parents' pressure and be responsible for our own life. Moreover, It does great help to our future life. Having a job means important thing that we start to make connection to the society. We can contact with many people from all walks of life and we can obtain lots of information from them. It can benefit us a lot to our future life. Last but not least, a part-time job teaches us the hardship of making a life. Nowadays, because of the great life and the love of the parents, many students spend money at will. It can have a negative impact on the future. Doing a job can help us understand it. Although having a part-time job may influence our studying and our health, I still consider that it does great benefits on us. All in all, if we have enough time, we should take an active part in the part-time job. We can experience a lot through it and it will gradually become precious deposits of our whole life.",CHN
"Nowadays smoking is banned in public places in more and more countries. And there is a heated discussion about whether smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Personally, I think it inadvisable to smoke in a restaurant. It is universally recognized that the cigarette contains a considerable number of harmful elements. Smoking may not only do harm to the smokers themselves but also to the people around them. So if a person is smoking while others are eating, the eaters will be greatly annoyed. No non-smokers want to be bothered by cigarette smoke. And it will be a piece of good news for them if all the restaurants go smoking free. But I am of the opinion that there should be smoking sections in some restaurants. It is hard for heavy smokers to quit smoking in a short time. If all the restaurants forbid smoking, they may get really uncomfortable. In general, smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants. Restaurants can set non-smoking areas and smoking areas for different customers. But I think that if smoking is permitted, it should always be in an area that non-smokers do not have to go through because no non-smokers want to expose themselves to second hand smoke.",CHN
"I believe so. It gives students some sort of education about the real power of money rather than just earning and saving. It did for me and I learned very quickly about how to make my small part-time wage work for me and not just by putting it into a savings account to grow at a snails pace with some form of low, annual interest. No way in the world! I am not saying that saving isn't important just that it is only a small part of our financial portfolios. Students would learn about budgeting and paying their bills etc. and hopefully, with the right guidance, learn some basic investment strategies. I suppose that for a lot of students, they need the job to pay fees or living costs etc. but if they could look at the possibilities beyond those points and as I mentioned previously, receive some form of guidance or better yet, a sound financial strategy, then they would have made a good head start towards securing their financial future. They won't get this from just every part-time job that they do or boss that they work for though. So, I think that it would be good for universities/colleges to provide the guidance that I mentioned and the students would also benefit from the knowledge that while the job itself might be a lot less than they desire, it still presents a financial opportunity that can be turned to their advantage on a larger scale than they first thought.",ENS
"At first glance, banning smoking at all restaurants seem like a viable step to take. After all, why would a reduction in air pollution and second hand smoke intake for non-smokers be a bad idea? Firstly, it's important to take into consideration that there are smokers who are heavily addicted to smoking. These individuals have to take consistent cigarette breaks to ensure that they do not suffer from the withdrawal symptoms, as theyou've been smoking for many years. Secondly, it would be possible to tweak the system, so as to allow smokers to smoke, while not affecting the rest of the population. There could be smoking rooms in the restaurant, or cordoned off areas located outside the dining area as designated smoking points, permitting the smokers to smoke there. This would resultantly cause minimal disturbance in air quality to the non-smokers, as the harmful second hand smoke would be dissipated before it reaches them. Also, it would give the smokers an avenue to relax and enjoy their cigarettes, after eating. Completely banning smoking straightaway at all restaurants across the country would result in displeasure within the smoking community, from the sudden and drastic change in smoking policies. If it is pertinent to improve air quality conditions by a reduction in smoking habits of the people in the country, it has to be done gradually, easing the policies in, so that the people affected are able to adjust to the new regulations.

"Someone believed that having a part-time job for a university student is important, but I cannot totally agree. Certainly, life and study in university is quite different from one's previous education experience as more individual motivation is required and less rigidity to decide one's own learning activities. Having a part-time job will be a good choice as students can earn their tuition fee and gain some experiences which can make their resumes more impressive and attractive. However, for the students who want to be involved in academic research, having a part time job may not be that essential and even at certain circumstances, can be counterproductive. I shall concede that they can gain some experience in team work, time management and communication skills. But these can also be acquired by doing research projects in the laboratory. Furthermore, working part-time can have negative influence on their academic performance as people's energy is not inexhaustible and there will be inevitable time conflicts. After all, their results in academic are far more important than working experience. In addition, at the university level, most students are not expected as experienced or equipped with apt skills. Most of the time, they are not likely to be on the appropriate positions where they will be after graduation. So a part-time job won't be efficient to tell them what their future careers look like.",HKG
"I agree that smoking in the public places should be banned. I think that the smokers' right should be partially restricted under the consideration of public health and other social benefits. Freedom of smokers, the doctor is important, but much more to defend people's freedom is assumed. Because smoking is harming people's health. The severity of smoking is passive smoking. The dangers of secondhand smoke have been already scientifically proven. This also affects the damage to children. If children when adults are greater than the damage. It was a kid, the more serious if it is young. Thus, smoking in public places raises a lot of damage. If possible, advice to quit smoking, smoking in public places should be banned 100%. Cigarette price hike is not an effective way. This is a real smokers do not give the effect of smoking. Smoking in public places is not good for his support. One example is a serious smoking in University buildings. Came out already in the school newspaper column. Students who smoke less, there are many students who do not smoke. Therefore, for the happiness of a number of smokers, you should not smoke in the building. Thus, from the public spaces around us will have to run non-smoking.",KOR
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons for it. First, smoking has smell. Some people including me have a headache when they are near the people who are smoking. People like me loss an appetite. Second, the smoke causes a cancer. Smoking in the place which many people are in like restaurants may cause their cancer. On the other hand, there are some people who disagree to my opinion. Most of them sill be smokers. They can not be without smoking, of course even if they are in a restaurant. They may think that there is no problem if the restaurants are divided into two areas: Smoking area and No Smoking area. Many restaurants have been divided into two areas, but they can not be divided completely. Smoke comes to the No Smoking area. I can understand some smokers' opinion, but the health of no smoker is also important. Of course smoking is bad for smoker's health. If smoking completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, smokers may get rid of smoking. If they give up smoking, they will be better in health. This is good for all people.",JPN
"There are many people smoking at a restaurant in Japan. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are two reasons I think it. First, smoking give not only mans who smoke but also who don't smoke unhealthy effects. It is called passive smoking. Especially children and expectant women are given very bad influences by smoking and passive smoking. At a restaurant even if there are smoking lounges, people who don't want to smoke may breathe smoke from cigarettes. They will feel so bad and may lose their appetites then. But if people who smoke heard these talks, there would not be a lot of people who decide to stop smoking at a restaurant at once. So I think that smoking should be completely at all restaurants in Japan to protect people who don't want to smoke. Second, to make smoking lounge needs large place to divide between smoking lounges and nonsmoking seats. In there are many restaurants which can't prepare large enough to make them. Owners who manage those restaurants have to build smoking lounges near nonsmoking seats. It is more and more possible that people who don't like cigarettes breathe smoke from them by passive smoking. So government in Japan should make laws which ban smoking at all restaurants.",JPN
"College student are very busy in studies they have no time for extra activities. If they are weak in studies then they should be work hard and for hardworking time is required. So, if they have part time job then they have less time for study and it is not possible k wo part time job b krein aur waqat niakal kar perhein bhi. It is too much difficult task for them. Some people are poor and do not afford they study of their child and their child want to study these student have no other chance. Some of the students want to depand on your sey so in this way they do not depend on their parents and get money from part time job. I think it is very much difficult for students so part time job destroy their future. Because they have double minded in this way. Their concentration on study is less. So, they fail to get knowledge and fail to get good marks. If student is brilliant and their study is not affected by part time job, and they think that they cover syllabus well and it is good thing for students to achieve or get some extra thing, you participated in race of life.",PAK
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I hate smell and smoke of tobacco. I think almost people who don't smoke feel it too. So there will be many problems about smoking in the restaurants. First, smoke dirty wallpaper, curtain, and so on in the restaurants. Second, there are possibilities to occur a fire, and children may get burned by their tobacco. Third, because there are people who hate smoking, the restaurants have to separate smoking seats and nonsmoking seats. But because the number of smoking people is smaller than that of people who don't smoke, people who don't smoke can sit down on the smoking seats. It is unfavorable situation. The other reason why I think so is that smoking is bad for the health. For example, smoking lead to cancer. It affects not only themselves, but also people who are around them. I think that it may be impossible to ban smoking at all place in Japan. But the restaurants are the eating place. The smell of tobacco ruins the smell of dishes. And if all the restaurants ban smoking, perhaps the number of smoker in Japan may decrease. I wish everyone all over the world stops smoking.",JPN
In those days when all the thing are very expensive. No other way to take job. College students whose parents cannot afford her studies then these student do part time job they have other way to earn money then in first time they go to college and then in second time they do job. This job have some effect that they earn money but their attention to study is decreasing. Then in her student life and as a worker are mixing and this is difficult for the college student to maintain both her study is affected due to this job. Student are in her youth that if they dreedy then they do not give attention to her study. This is the reason that part time job is bad they not only effect these two things but also health. In other way part time job is good more and more student are coming in this way and country is progress. If in the start they work hard and hard and one day they trained and do her job best. If the student manage this part time job then they help her parents in her duty. These student become the proud of her country. These student are already proud of her parents.

"I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I feel that while it is not important for students to have a part-time job, having one is beneficial. The main aim a college student has is to study well. He should cherish the opportunity given to him to gain new knowledge and spend the precious few years learning as much as he can before entering the workforce. Having a part-time job will drain the student of his time and energy which may affect his studies at school. The student may not have enough time to study for exams due to his work schedule. Worse, he may be too tired from work to be able to concentrate in school. In addition, work related problems may affect his concentration in school. These problems, as a result of having a part-time job, will affect the student's performance in school which defeats the aim of having an education. On the other hand, a part-time job may be beneficial to the student. Having one allows him to know the hardships of earning money and appreciate the care given to us by our parents. This may teach him to spend money wisely and treasure the roof over our heads, the food we have and the extra comfort items we can afford to buy. ",SIN
"Recently it seems that smoking is really dangerous thing, not only smokers but also people around them. Above all Passive smoking, it means to get the harmful thing from the tobacco's smoke, has attracted considerable attention. In fact tobacco contains the cause of the cancer. And moreover tobacco's smoke has also serious thing for human health. So passive smoking is a matter of life and death. Therefore we shouldn't ignore this problem. And furthermore, please imagine the today's situation of each restaurant. Surely many restaurants divide the area, smoking or non-smoking, but it's totally meaningless. Because even if we don't want to seat in smoking area, but if the non-smoking area is full and we have no time to wait, sometimes we have to seat in smoking area. And of course children or pregnant women also use restaurants. Especially smoking is dangerous for such people, but under such situation they must be exposed danger. Restaurants are used everyday by various people. So this case is different from others. It is certain that smoker has also the right to smoke freely. But this problem is related to the people's life.

Part time job is a good thing. It helps to people to get more rupees to run their homes expense. It is not working all the day but it is only working at some selected time in the morning or evening or when you find time. So part time job is extra job other than the orignal job. In this way part time job means second job. It is good thing. Every person should do part time job. It can help to get more money. Women and students are do part time job. This is good for them. But it is some times not very good. It is harmful. It has many bad effect on peoples. For example if a man is do a part time job then he is work from morning to evening till late. So he is tired so much. In this way part time job is not good. He is not give any time to his family and childrens. So when women is doing part time job she is neglect her home and childrens and family. So part time job not good in this way. When student is do part time job he is study lose and weak.

"It is generally acknowledged that smoking harms not only people who smoke but also those who around the smoker. So it causes a social problem about whether smoking should be banned in the public places. For example, now we want to talk about whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There is no doubt that we only have a Yes answer. Though it is hard to carry it out, we have innumerous reasons to support this action. First of all, health comes first. Every day restaurants are full of all kinds of people. For example, if there are smokers in the restaurant, considering that there is no fresh air, the smoke will harm everyone here. If a man who never smokes goes to restaurants, it equals that he is forced to smoke every day. Besides, assuming a woman who has a baby in the restaurant, the health of the baby will be greatly affected. Then the illnesses caused by smoking will become more and the rate of death will rise. It is obvious that the average of lifetime will fall down. As it happens like this, where stands a healthy person in the earth? That is terrible!For the health of all the human beings, we really should take some measures. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Then our life must be better.",CHN
"In my opinion, I agree that 'part-time job is an important for college students'. Because it has advantages for college students but there are also disadvantages. The advantages of part-time jobs are First, it is a good experience for teaching students to manage time between working and learning. This one makes them have more responsibility in their duties and grow up too. Second, college students have chance to find money (salary). So it helps them to realize how value of money is because they always get money from parents actually. If they need money, they just ask parents, they will get money to buy the stuffs they want suddenly. This behavior spoils them! On the other hands, if they do part-time jobs, they will know how hard to find money. Then this way helps them to save money and spend money in useful ways. Third, they get many friends and more society. This one helps them to know how to adjust themselves for being in society. All these advantages I said above are the suitable reasons to do part-time job if students can manage everything clearly. But there are some disadvantages if they can't manage time well, their learning will be worse. In university life, there are many activities and they should do them; just they do activities, their studying may be getting worse. Moreover they do 2 things together, activities and part-time job; they are tired and have no time to revise textbooks. Then it will damage your learning and grade! Furthermore, students still have no time to rest and that's so bad for their health. I'm the one who want to do part-time job so I agree college students to do it. But before they do, they should manage themselves well.",THA

Also, do not persuade them to drinking an alcohol and go to Pup-Bar that it is the wrong way for them.

Many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking. Smoking may cause several diseases such as cough asthma. It also destroys lungs.

If smoking is not banned in restaurants, children are exposed to smoking. Smoking pollutes the atmosphere around. Banned smoking in a restaurants protects non-smoker from heart attack, lung cancer and many other problems. It protects the workers of the restaurants.

"I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Maybe it would sound unfair and hard of people who smoke. Personally, as a nonsmoker, I strongly believe that smoking should be prohibited at restaurants. The main reasons are as follow.

However, by the second-hand smoking, this nonsmoker can be seriously affected. Considering the nonsmoker's health, smoking shouldn't be allowed in public places. Another reason is the smoke and the smell. It is really bothering smelling cigarette and being affected by the smoke especially when you are eating. The restaurants are places where food is served and the environment should be thoroughly considered. Finally, smoking should be banned at restaurants because it is a place where everybody can come and go. Smoking is especially bad for kids and pregnant women. We cannot restrict kids and pregnant from coming to restaurants, so it would be good for smokers to stop smoking at the restaurants. The health is the most precious thing we should care about.

By allowing smokers to smoke in the restaurant, those non-smoker patrons will become victims of second hand smoke.

No one would like to be ""kill"" by those smokers in early age. If they see someone smoking in the restaurant, they might not want to dine in the restaurant. They would rather go other restaurant or food store. The restaurant would then definitely incur a loss. Which owner will like to see their business suffer losses? None will. Also by allowing people to smoke in restaurant, it will just encourage those smokers to continue to smoke. However, it is the other way round that should be encourage --- stop smoking.

"All college students should have a part-time job. There are many excellent reasons to join the work force while still attending school. For some students, the extra money will assist them in obtaining needed books and materials for study. Others will benefit from the discipline and time-management skills gained in balancing a study schedule with a semi-regular work regimen. Students who spend time away from the oppressive, thought-controlling atmosphere of most large universities will meet people accustomed to living and thinking in freedom. It can come as a welcome shock to the cloistered student to learn such a fascinating world exists, where the recommended norms of contemporary university thought patterns not only do not apply, they are mocked as absurd. As well, occupying oneself with an outside activity such as work restricts the amount of time available to fall in with bad company or develop social habits deleterious to academic achievement. Said activities include extended periods of video game playing during school hours, lounging on one's sofa watching daytime television, indulging in repeated bouts of binge drinking with equally dissolute friends, and an obsessive devotion to online fleshpots promising sexual release in exchange for money.

They can just earn their money by doing part-time jobs. At the same time, they can learn to be independent. This will help them when they grow up in the future. it is also a great experience. It also gives you a chance to see what it is like to earn and spend money of your own. Maybe some of them want to prepare for the next jobs, some of them because they couldn't handle with the scholar task and others just for having some extra pocket money. In the end I conclude that having a job while you are teen involves mainly advantages and it would help you a lot in your life but only if you know how to combine it with studying and partying.",THA
"People do part time job to earn money to fulfill their expensive and for enjoyment just. Those people who faced many difficulties them they do part time job. They do part time job due to some problems that having no sufficient money for their every needs. In the morning they study and go to any institution and they do job. Some poor parents did not fulfill the needs of their children and not able to fulfill their expensive for higher education. Then the students who want to higher education they make a time table and set him for a part time job. But there are some disadvantages of part time job. When a person is doing a part time job, he does not any time to relax and he tried badly. He tried physically and mentally as doing work all the day. It damages the ability of human mind to think well. Part time job can badly effect on a person mentally and physically both side. I think the person who works for the whole day, then automatically he has no time to spend in the beauty of nature. He does not spend his sometime to see the beauty of the world and beauty of the nature. Part time job has some advantage other than disadvantage.",PAK
"Smoking is very harmful to human being. But there are thousands of people smoking around the world even though they know smoking is harmful. The most serious problem is that non-smokers are damaged by second-hand smoking of smoker. Media has emphasized the dangerousness of second-hand smoking. Lately, the notion of third-hand smoking appeared. I have seen TV program about third-hand smoking. A father usually smokes outside and washes his hands with soap. He hugs his baby and plays with him or her after smoking and washing his hands. Even though the baby doesn't smell the smoke, dangerous stuffs are found out from skin of the baby. The research shows the baby has the same amount of dangerous stuff as adult smoker. I was shocked by the result of the research. After I saw this program, I realized that we can't escape from the dangerousness of smoking anywhere. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants are public area where any people can drop by and use. In these area non-smokers are easily affected by smoker. Smokers have to know the effect of their smoking to others. Government should take a action for health of all citizen.",KOR
"I think that to have a part-time job for college students is valuable. I never worked as a part-time job since I entered *** University. I began a part-time job at Hokkahokatei 5 months ago, I worked very hard. I learned a lot of things there, for example, greetings. I have never known that when I enter working place I should say Ohayougozaimasu. And I learned communications are very important, I had a lot of trouble for the first time because learning a work was hard and I didn't familiar there worker. But I came to work smoothly for 2 months because I got well with them. I had a lot of communication them, so, I got used to work. And another thing which I learned is that earning money is very hard. If I work 3 for a week, I can earn about 40000 yen for a month. Of course it is very hard. But, I want a lot of things, clothes, shoes, games, bags, wallet, big sofa bed and so on. And I need money for food and association, for example, karaoke, boring, tennis club... I'm running short of money every day, so, I have to work.

"I agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in the country. The largest and most undisputable reason is that smoking shortens people's lives. It is definitely the largest cause of lung cancer in the world and is a plague on mankind. A substitute habit should be invented for people wanting to relax that will not kill them slowly while polluting the air around them. Sanitary issues are also important to think about since smoke not only stains the smokers teeth, clothes and hair, it stains the walls and must therefore get on the plates, in the food and drinks as well. Air walls, air conditioners and curtains do not completely block out the smoke or smell from the non-smoking side of a restaurant. For some extra sensitive people it could make eating at that restaurant impossible. Safety is another reason why smoking should be banned. Lighting fires indoor is one of the most obvious reasons for buildings to burn down, and with the potential for a cigarette butt that has not been full extinguished to find it's way into the trash, onto the floor or perhaps even be doused with a flammable liquid such as Bacardi 151. Hello Mr. Molotov cocktail.",ENS
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan I agree to this opinion on the whole. I dislike tobacco and I think it is worth than useless. It cause lung cancer and have a bad influence upon babies especially for women who has babies. So I wish tobacco died from all over the world. I understand that I should allow smokers also have the right to smoke. If he or she hopes to smoke, we can't invade his or her right to smoke. But I can't endure being made to breathe the smoke. What we allow smokers to do is the right to smoke only for them, not the right to make others smoke. Smokers must not mistake this point. That is to say, I think smokers must not smoke in the place where they can't account for their smoke. The restaurant is the place where men and women of all ages come. So I think smokers must not smoke in the restaurant. I have one more reason. Breathing the smoke, we can't savor the original taste and smell of food. If there are no smoking seats, the smoke float and come to the seats. People who don't smoke can't enjoy their dinner after all. So I think smoking should be banned completely.",JPN

Because of both cigarette and alcohol were accepted from government to allow using them. A lot of Thai persons were addicted them, more than 10 millions person. But the problems for cigarette have more than alcohol drinking. Because of cigarette has an impact to cigarette smoker health and person around smoker. But Alcohol drinkers have health problems only themselves. It can't produce health problem for persons around drinkers. Cigarette has many toxic substances and teratogenic substances. These can affect to personnel health, such as respiratory diseases, cardiac and vascular diseases, cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcer disease and carcinoma (especially lung cancer).

Smoking has been completely banned at public places, such as hospital, cinema, restaurant, garden or park.

"I agree this statement. I have three reasons. First, Cigarette is a kind of drug for smoker. It includes Nicotine and this has poison. If you smoke 40, 50 cigarettes every day for 20, 30 years, you will probably become diseases of lung. So not-smoker should not smoke and smoker should stop smoking as early as they can. In this point of view, this opinion will be useful for smoker to start to stop smoking and to send a healthy life. Second, Smoking is not healthy for surrounding person too. This is because the smoke which smoker blow out has strong poison. A restaurant is the place where a lot of people are, and some smoker comes there with his family. So smokers should not smoke there for the others and their family in order not to bless the smoke. Certainly, there is an argument that separating smoker and not-smoker solves this problem, but it is almost impossible to separate them completely. People who are around border can be made to keep blessing the smoke. Finally, because recently people who understand an effect of cigarette and stop smoking are increasing, this idea is not ideal. It may be achieved sooner than you expect.",JPN
"I totally agree with this statement. Personally, I think university is a transition between narrow study and the more open society. In recent years, a large number of graduates fail to find a job after their graduation. One reason is that they seldom take a part-time job at university so that they haven't accumulated any job experience. As we all know, a lot of job hunting advertisements show that experienced hunters are usually needed. A adult with one year or more of job experience is easier to acquire a suitable job. To fit the demand, we college students had better take at least a part-time job at our free time. What can we do if we take a part-time job?From my point of view, the common choice is to be a tutor. We can make the most use of our alreay acquired knowledge. We can teach a high, middle school student or even a pupil, we can teach them maths, Chinese, English and so on. Apart from a tutor, a job in a small restaurant is OK. There we can experience the tough living and working conditions so that we won't spoil the better job-if can-we get in the future. To sum up, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, we should still focus on our major. Only if we get a high degree, can we make full use of our knowledge.",CHN
"Do you agree with the following statement? 1. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with this opinion. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have following reasons. First, college students should know the real world. I think to have a part-time job is to study the real world. It is important for college students to know the real world. It becomes useful for them when they decide a job formally. If we experience many kind of part-time jobs, for example, cram school's teacher, waiter, cook, and so on, we can decide what kind of job we really like. If we don't have a part-time job when we are a college student, and if we get a job without knowing what the real world is like, perhaps we can not continue the job long. Next, college students should learn worth of money. Until you graduated from high school, you could rely on our parents. But once we entranced to university, we should not rely on our parents as we were high school students. We should buy the text book, our clothing or something with money that we earn by ourselves. Then, we can learn how precious money is. Of course, college students go to university to study. So, studying at university is most important thing. But I think studying outside university is also important. From these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"You are right. I agree with the topic. Smoking is terrible, awful and very bad. Smoking must to be banned at not only restaurant also any public places! But I think smoking has been banned at a restaurant already. Hasn't it? Imagine you eat at a restaurant and someone smokes next to you. I wouldn't eat anything if I were you. You lose both money and health if you smoke. Eventually you pay for disease. What a silly! I work out. So I've never smoked and I don't even drink. But my father has smoked for over 20 years. I worry about his health. Smoking ruins also family. Parents need to stop smoking for the children. Last week I saw something about smoking on a newspaper. The government said that now it's illegal to smoke on a road or a square. I love that. I am done talking about smoking. What else can I say is smoking is worse for other people than the smoker!

"We should banned people from smoking inside the restaurant. We should have manners and etiquettes. We should respect others who do not smoke for their healthy life. If one customer smokes inside the restaurant, others customers should suffer from the smell and ashes which are bad for the body. There are also several reasons why we should banned people from smoking. It is because that as generally known, the 2nd hand smoking is worse for the body than 1st hand smoking. For 2nd hand smoking there is no filter which blocks ashes and other bad ingredients to go inside the body. And there are what you call manners in public places which we should follow. We should not make others uncomfortable by the smell of the cigarette. We know that there are also young people who came to the restaurant to eat and enjoy with their parents or friends. They also can smoke outside the restaurant if they really want to smoke, even if it is tiresome for them to do. We should think of others before thinking of our own benefits. By helping others to keep their rights and by following the manners inside the public we can make better and happier society.",PHL
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. One of the reasons is that harmful second-hand smoking can be spread out through central ventilation system in restaurants. Since most of restaurants are air-conditioned, air in restaurants is often recycled for a long period of time without filtration. If smoking is not completely banned at all restaurants, there is a higher possibility that some inconsiderate smokers will ignite their cigarettes inside restaurants. Because cigarettes will emit second-hand smoking, those second-hand smoking can be spread out via ventilation system. Prolong exposure of second-hand smoking will cause long-term respiratory diseases and harm non-smokers' health in long run. Therefore, for the sake of non-smokers' health, smoking should be completely prohibited in all restaurants. Also, prohibition of smoking in restaurants may prevent fire ignition. As we know that most of restaurants are not well-ventilated, it is dangerous to ignite the cigarettes without proper care of cigarettes. Fire accidents often occur when smokers accidentally ignite flammable objects. In particular, some inconsiderate smoker will throw away used cigarettes without extinguish the flame, if there are flammable objects nearby, there is higher possibility that those objects catch fire. In a serious case, if the petroleum gas bottles are placed, there will be fire explosion. In order to prevent fire accident and ensure the safety of other customers, it is suggested that smoking in all restaurants should be banned. To conclude, it is necessary to ban smoking in all restaurants as other non-smokers will suffer from the second-hand smoking. Since most of restaurants have central ventilation system, harmful second-hand smoking can be spread out, which in turn affect our respiratory system. Also, smoking prohibition can prevent fire. Most of fire accidents in restaurants happen when smokers forget to extinguish the flames. In order to ensure the safe environment in restaurants, it is essential to ban smoking in the restaurants.",HKG
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with this statement.

I spent it playing with my friends, eating fast foods, buying clothes etc. But I soon exhausted all money, because the amount of money which I could use per a month was limited by my mother. I irritated about that, and thought that why my mother doesn't give me more money? Then I entered *** University and started working as a part-timer (I work at a Japanese bar as a waitress), and knew how hard to earn money is. At workplace, I have to bear many painful duties. For example, I must keep smiling, must run, must take heavy dishes, must be kind to every customer, and sometime I'm scolded by my master. These make me very tired, but after enduring them, I can get money. In this way I really knew the value of money. We should not spend money without knowing how thankful thing money is.

Part time job is very common in daily listening. due to increasing economic pressure the income of a single middle class person can not fulfill the needs. the part time job is a job that is to be done by a middle class person to fulfill the needs of his or her family. there are many reasons for part time job we are living in such a society where is a lot of expenses. Sometime the income single job could not meet the expenses of only food home and cloth. In our society there are a number of families where there is only a single person that has to bear the expenses of whole family. There are a large number of family members. So one has to do part time job. Our increasing expenses due to following the fashion able society also cause to do part time job. The part time job is not very easy to do. One has to do extra work that is very difficult. One often tiered one cannot give time to his personals. Mostly there are part time jobs at night. These jobs disturb the sleep and cause philological problem. Part time job during studies is very common to day due to lack of pocket money for students. It is very difficult students cannot give proper time to their studies. in this way the brilliant students also cannot study with efficiency. This is the major problem that intends to do part time job. We should have to take the steps against such unimportant expenses it reduce the economic burden.

"Getting a job while in college is important and a good idea, if students need the money. Students do have to be careful though, that it will not get in the way of their studies. Obviously, there are many students who are living off a tight budget and finding it hard to make ends meet. Students need to decide if they are willing to sacrifice time when considering getting a part-time job while still in college. The pros and cons of working while in college are numerous and need to be carefully weighed up before taking the next step. Many students, because of their financial circumstances, have no choice but to get a job. Others however, might find it more suitable to obtain additional financial aid like a college loan that is not required to be repaid until after they graduate and have a job. Working a part-time job will give the student hands on job experience that will come in very handy irrespective of what subject the student is majoring in. Students should also consider what kinds of jobs will meet their needs but not pile more stress on them or overload their already busy schedule. With a little careful thought, students can merge the two so that they do not conflict with each other.",ENS
"It is absolutely critical for college students to take on a part-time job. To be better prepared for the working society, students should be encouraged to work during their free time. However, it isn't an easy task for them to study and work concurrently so time-management is the key to success. First, students should consider jobs which they had passion and interest in. I believe one will excel only if he is motivated in doing his job. Hence, an art student could probably work as a guide in the Singapore Art Museum while a hospitality student works in the front office department of Ritz Carlton hotel. Such valuable working experience allows students to learn of what is expected of them. Moreover, they will be able to acquire new skills and knowledge which is highly applicable in their work in future. Prior to graduation, I had worked at Fairmont Singapore in the Banquet department, Singapore Cruise Centre as an usher and Resort World Sentosa as a customer service agent. As a hospitality student, these working experience are priceless. Lastly, grades are never a true reflection of one's ability. A diversified working experience defines one's self and one's worth. Therefore, I will encourage all students to work part-time. ",SIN
"I do not smoke, and I consider smoking to be a dirty and unpleasant habit. It is also dangerous. However, I think that people should be free to indulge in unpleasant habits and dangerous activities as long as they harm no-one else. I enjoy skiing and mountain-climbing, both of which involve an element of risk, and I do not think they should be banned. Dangerous driving, on the other hand, is rightly illegal. The issue of smoking in public places is more complex. Smoking should be banned in all places of work, as it imposes risks on the employees beyond those that are strictly essential for the job. By analogy, construction workers sometimes have to carry out dangerous tasks, but they should be provided with adequate safety equipment, and should not have to carry out dangerous and inessential tasks. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants that have employees. In the case of restaurants run by a single individual or couple, in the abstract, I think that smoking should be permitted, as the owners and customers are free agents. I certainly think this principle applies in the case of a bar or cafe, as, if someone starts smoking, one can simply drink one's glass of beer or coffee and leave. However, the situation with respect to restaurants is more complicated, as a meal may last an hour or two, so one is committed to that time, and temporarily ceases to be a free agent; one cannot simply leave if someone starts smoking nearby. Therefore, on balance, I would say that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.",ENS

It is true that students cannot focus all their attention on their subjects because they should spend some time on their job. But that is not to say that the former view is totally decisive. In my opinion, no one can deny that the part-time job can many benefits. Firstly, college students can learn how to get along well with others and obtain working experience when they adjust to the new job. Secondly, they can understand the difficulty of earning money and learn to save money. Thirdly, college students may realize what they are interested in and which way they long to choose in the future if they are at sea. What is more, students will understand the meaning of taking the responsibility and become a mature man. Only they experience it, they can grow up. Students today should keep pace with the development of the society. The young must strengthen the sense of competition, the sense of being independent and the sense of self-fulfillment.

It is important for college students to understand that they are a member of the society by working. Finally, I think we must help parents by having a part-time job.

The parents will see that their children are becoming responsible and be willing to give them more leeway to do as they please. They do not have to be so controlling of the children because the children are showing them that they have what it takes to make decisions for themselves. Next, many students need to make money. College is very expensive, and so many of them have to find a part-time job so that they can pay to go to school.

"It is commonly acknowledged that smoking is harmful to people's health because many harmful substances can come into smokers' lung and make it ill. To make us live better, I think smoking in public places should be forbidden. Forbidding smoking can make the air in public places cleaner. Smoking can spoil air because of the emitted CO2, CO and other poisonous gas. People need clean air to live healthily. If we don't get clean air, we will be ill soon.

A lot of people have died of lung cancer which was caused by smoking. Smokers are always worried about their health. The WTO pointed out that the best way to avoid lung cancer is quitting smoking. People should stop smoking unless they don't mind dying of cancer. Forbidding smoking is good for our country's economic for the government won't have to put large amounts of money on medical insurance. In spite of losing taxes on tobacco, the government will save more on medical insurance. In a word, forbidding smoking in public places is both good for smokers and non-smokers.

Therefore, nowadays many country tried to make a law that smoking in the restaurant is illegal. By prohibiting smoking in a like restaurant, we may be saving the lives of hundreds of people, including your own as well as yours family. If a survey was taken asking people how often they deliberately put the lives of their friends and family at risk, it's a pretty safe bet that most people would say never. However they may be forced to reconsider their.",KOR
"Smoking must be banned in all restaurants in the country. In my opinion, I must agree with this. First, second hand smoking is worse than smoking the cigarette itself. It has its ill effects. People must be considerate to other people. The ingredients in cigarettes affect everything from the internal functioning of organs to the efficiency of the body's immune system. The effects of cigarette smoking are destructive and widespread. Second, it has an ingredient called nicotine, which reaches the brain within 10 seconds after smoke is inhaled. Third, it contains carbon monoxide which binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, preventing affected cells from carrying a full load of oxygen. Fourth, it contains carcinogens, which damage important genes that control the growth of cells, causing them to grow abnormally or to reproduce too rapidly. Fifth, it would greatly affect the customers in the restaurant. Think about it, some people get pissed when the tables next to them are smoking. What if the family has a child with them, it would affect the children's internal functioning and its immune system as stated previously. Researchers state that in every eight seconds, a human life is lost to tobacco use somewhere in the world. That translates to approximately 5 million deaths annually. Tobacco offers us a life of slavery, a host of chronic, debilitating illnesses and ultimately death. And think about it: We pay big bucks for those ""benefits. """,PHL

"""Why don't we ban smoking at all restaurant?"" This statement is the most asked question which is raised by HongKongers and revealed in a recent survey conducted by the Hong Kong Government last year. True, smoking brings about a great death toll and causes suffer on those who smoke and do not smoke. Nicotine, tar and smoke ashes are the contributing elements leading to 4364 life-claim in 2007. Even worse, second hand smoking could lead to additional death toll and torture people who never smoke before. In legal definition, restaurant is categorized as a public area. Thus, many citizens would pass this area accordingly. If there is even a small number of smoker inside the restaurant, they can still pass their disgusting cigarette smoke to others in the confined area. To be frank, this can lead to great inconvenience to non-smokers inside a place where they are supposed to eat. In scientific view, cigarette smoke is a kind of mutagen which can lead to irreversible harm. Why should we tolerate smoking such a selfish act in HK? Why should we tolerate cigarette smoke circulating around our fresh air and damaging our health? Another piece of rationale is that non-smoker contributes to over 90% of entire population in HK. For our public interest, we should protect the 90% non-smoker's health rather than indulge the 10% smoker eroding our health. With aforementioned, smoking should be banned at all restaurants!",HKG
"Smoking is the most common physical activity which has been adopted by our young's as well as adults. It causes a serious damage to the brain, lungs and many other body parts. Once a person is addicted to it, it is very difficult for him to shake it off. Although this all should be banned everywhere but it should be strictly prohibited in the public places especially in the restaurants. Restaurants are most common public places. There is no fresh air in the restaurants to carry away the smoke of the cigarettes and other such took by which smokers usually smoke. Everyone has an idea that of damage which is caused by smoking but still a great majority of people have become a victim of smoking and have spoiled their lives. The smoke pollutes the atmosphere by its various ingredients like Nicotine, tar etc. Research have proved that smoking caused by lung cancer not only in the smokers itself but also the people by whom he is surrounded because smoke makes its way through the nostrils into the lungs of the people around a smoker. When a person smokes in a restaurant he not only harms himself but also others around him then he pollutes the atmosphere and also the food. This kind of food is not less than a poison. Therefore it is the responsibility of the administration of the restaurant and each and every one of us to do our best to stop this rising destruction",PAK

It means smokers have a time when they must need to smoke. So sometimes smokers have a time when they must smoke in a restaurant. So we can't ban to smoke. But I always think it is too bad if there is a person who smokes next chaire. When we eat, smell of tobacco brake the mood and make foods bad. So we should separate the space where who smoke use and who don't smoke use, I think. It is easy thought and very good for each other who smoke and who don't smoke.

"With the increasing pressure of the difficulty in looking for a good job, more and more college students choose a part-time job as a way of adapting to the society earlier and easier. It's also a controversial topic whether we should have a part-time job or center on the knowledge taught in the college. However, as far as I'm concerned, one coin has two sides, but it's vital or us to get some experience before stepping into the colorful stage of society. At first, the knowledge from the books is very limited and it's very hard to put the theory into practice just in the campus. Putting what you learn into reality is the symbol of absorbing the knowledge fully. Besides, part-time job gives us a great opportunity to contact the people from all walks of life. A good interpersonal relationship also plays a very important role in our career. Last but not least, part-time job is a job we can earn some money from. This may not be the most important, but the salary we earn by ourselves can give us a sense of treasuring the money earned by hard work. What we give equals to what we get. To sum up, part-time job is a good way to get more social experience; we college students should attach more importance to it no matter what you want to get from it.

Then, I like to talk with my guests. They are very kind and interesting. So I think it is very nice to have a part-time job. Second, we can have a lot of good experience with a part-time job. Thanks to the job, I think I became able to talk with people who I don't know at all in spite of my shyness. Now I can talk to various people with smile. Also I learned the way of speaking to my guests. The way of speaking is very important when we work for an office or a company in the future. The last reason is that we can change our view of life or value. I made friends with many people whose generation is different from me. I learned there is a lot of way of thinking. I feel my view of life changed and now I send better life. I thank my job members. In this way, I agree with the statement. If my friends don't have part-time job, I want them to have it.",JPN
"Many people in the world are smokers. They still smoking even they know it is a dangerous activity. They smoke everywhere, even at the public facility. I think it should be a rule to be banned the smokers to smoking in a public facility, especially in a restaurant. Restaurant is a place for people to eat, not for smoking. The smokers there will disturb another customer. Maybe they didn't feel it but the others will not feel comfortable with the situation, especially because of the smoke and the smell from their cigarette. They come to the restaurant to enjoy their meal, not for smell the smoke of the cigarette. The other reason to forbidden smoking because the smoke from the cigarette that they made will be inhaled by the other customers. Even the others don't smoking but the smoke that we inhale is very dangerous too. It can make many dangerous diseases that can kill us. On the other hand, the smokers not only make themselves in dangerous situation, but they bring the other people too. The restaurant that doesn't have a rule about smoking will get the bad effect too. For example, some customers may decide wouldn't come to this restaurant again even the food is delicious. Actually, it isn't mistake from the service but because of the customers that smoking, their another customers decided wouldn't come again to their restaurant. It can make they will lose their profits. So, the restaurants must have a rule to forbidden the smokers smoking in their restaurants because smoking will bring the bad effects for the restaurant and their customers.",IDN

They fulfill their need at home, at restaurant or any refreshment or pienic point. Restaurants that are the best source of refreshment are often used for this purpose. Smoking must be banned at all restaurant. It has reasons behind it. restaurant are the place of enjoyment not the place of such activities. It destroyes the health as well as enjoyment. People who are actually passive smokers and come towards hotel for some relief are disturbed and porturbad. This smoking proves move dangers for them then the active smokers. Fanilies that have children with them face problem. Children are very sensitive. They are suffered by smoking more rapidly then the others. Imitation is also a very important reason.

Depends on the money home and working part time as part of helping alleviate the burden of home and training to recognize their responsibility.

Working part time, we will know the responsibility of having to work more or less. But a stand must see that work to be done manually it is appropriate or not.

"I don't support the idea of banning smoking completely in all the restaurants. Though I think it's necessary to set up some bans to limit the smokers properly. We all know that smoking is bad for health, not only for the smokers themselves, but also the innocent second-hand smokers, like me. For the health of us, the smokers should consider the non-smokers. And in return, should non-smokers also think for the smokers? If on some conditions, their smoking does not affect us much, why must we set up so inflexible bans. For example, not all the restaurants are crowded in all the time. Maybe sometimes, restricting people by moral is more efficiency and comprehensive than the law. I think smoking is a generation problem, and we can not carry the smoking bans too far and too widely. To some degree, smokers also have the right to smoke, isn't it? Maybe some of us are addicted to the computer games. I think what computers to us are what cigarettes to smokers. It's not hard to imagine how difficult it is to control smoking, let alone throwing it completely. My father is a smoker, too. And for my health, when being with me, he never smokes. Sometimes, when he really wants to smoke, he will go to a corner to smoke. All in all, I don't agree the idea to ban smokers smoking in all the restaurants.",CHN

So I think it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to survey, people who smoke indirectly will be harmed much more than smoker himself, and smoking more will cause cancer. So people who smoke in public places are threatening the other people's life safety. It is equal to crime! When one is smoking while others are having their dinner, the smoke will fill the whole restaurant and at the same time, people who are eating will swallow much smoke and it is very bad for their health. On the other hand, the smoke will destroy the environment of the restaurant and reduce the customers' appetite. There is another problem which is of great importance, the cigarette ends that are not extinguished completely in the public will likely cause a fire. It's very dangerous. Above are my opinions.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, It reduces harmful effect of second-hand smoking. If smoking is free at restaurants, it may have a bad effect on non-smokers. Especially, the old and the infirm have great damage. Exposure to second-hand smoke can slow children's body growth owing to causing gene modification and easily bring about getting cancer. And it is quite probable that children who are exposed to passive smoke catch the cold. Also, involuntary smoking during pregnancy can cause serious health problems to a fetus. Second, It is because if small place starts banning smoking, our country's may tend to take it for granted that people are non-smoker. These days some people have a hard time resting of life because of lung cancer. They are very sorry that they start smoking. But if we carry out this rule, it can reduce smokers and prevent teen's smoking. For these reasons, I really agree about that. However, of course it may exits a restaurant owners who think that their sales fall. I'd like to tell them, ""Having a long-range view is better than only thinking your profits.

This topic is hot discussed by people nowadays. People's opinions vary sharply. As far as I am concerned, there are three major views. The majority of people especially the parents think it is of great importance for those young adults to get a part-time job, which they think will make college students have a better understanding to the society. Most students in China have few opportunity to touch the society, resulting in the problem of high score but low level of ability.

They think have a part time job will have side effect on those students. firstly, taking a part-time job will occupy too much time. Secondly, college students are too young to get involved in this complex society. they will be cheated, which is dangerous. Thirdly, these young adults may have less interest in study. On top of the two viewpoints, I subscribe to another opinion. I believe there is no standard answer. Whether it is important or necessary depends on ourselves.

"What makes an independent college student? Does one need to have his own condominium unit? Or possibly, one needs to be able to support his or her needs?

One of the reasons as to why we need to know what we will face is so that we will be ready. Aside from that, it will also help us earn money in our own. Having a college student take a part-time job may be worrisome for the parents, but surely, it will help them greatly in the long run. There are several advantages in having a part-time job. First edge that it will give is that one will be able to earn money. Aside from earning money, one will learn the hardships that one has to face in order to achieve it. This idea will help one to be stronger as a person and to be more determined in making one's dream a success. The money you will earn will also help one in their studies. In time when a student needs to buy books and other references, you will not need to bother your parents for money since one will have the means to buy it himself.

" I don't agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in China. I'm not a smoker, and I don't like people smoking around me. But I still don't think it is not a good idea to completely forbid people smoking at the restaurants in China. On one hand, smoking is not forbidden by the whole society. All the countries have no such laws that completely forbidding smoking. Though nicotine makes people get addicted, making people die earlier. This is quite similar as drugs. The reason that tobacco has never been banned is that great amount of taxes are paid by the smokers and tobacco companies. This has been a important part of all the tax income to the governments. So rights are given to the people. Smoking is not about affecting people nearby, it's more like a right of freedom and fairness. Since governments never banned smoking, in my opinion, dividing guests into smoking area and non-smoking area at the restaurants would be a great idea for now. But I am looking forward to the day that all tobacco is forbidden all over the world, not only in Chinese restaurants.",CHN

"Should smoking be banned from restaurants? What will be benefited from this? Is smoking really the reason why people die everyday of lung cancer? In my opinion, smoking should be banned from all restaurants for many reasons that I think almost everyone will agree. Smoking is one of the problems people encounter on the streets, in their daily life especially on restaurants. Some restaurants these days have provided smoking areas for smokers. For me, this is a good thing since it wouldn't bother or affect other people who are enjoying their time with their family and friends. But in my opinion, smoking should be banned in restaurants even if they offer a smoking lounge because it affects the health of other people especially second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers may not be really smoking but it affects them the most and not the one smoking. All of us have other opinions about smoking but it really depends on who you are asking about this issue since all of us have our own opinions about smoking.

From my point of view, I can't approve the proposal of banning smoking completely at all restaurants all over the country. Absolutely, it's not easy for us to understand what this proposal aims at. And we also understand this way to solve the question. But in fact, this way is not fair to those who have become heavy smokers. Though I have no experience of smoking, I know it's really hard to give up smoking once we are addicted to it. So once this proposal is carried out, it will bring sizable inconvenience to many families. On the other hand, we have to admit smoking does harm to people's health seriously. In terms of many researches, smoking has been the cause for many serious diseases, such as lung cancer. Maybe some smokers don't care the bad aftereffect it imposes to your body, but you should have cared others. When one smoke, the smoke from his cigarettes will make people living or working with him suffer from it just as themselves were smoking. So the smokers can't be allowed to smoke at their pleasure in the public, especially restaurants where many people gather. So it's not proper to carry out this proposal thoroughly, while it's also improper to allow smoking to a degree.

It is no doubt that there are so many advantages when doing the part-time job. However it is pretty important that doing the part-time job shouldn't affect our schoolwork. When we do it, it definitely reduces our time and energy. We can't give up our schoolwork. We should strike a balance between the part-time job and the schoolwork. If we can both strengthen ourselves by doing the part-time job and have good performance in schoolwork, then we indeed create a win-win situation. Wish everyone have a golden harvest!",TWN
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants because nobody is supported because it is very bad thing to do when people have food and should not be made or produce because it will make others suffer with clients and customers will pumping inhale tobacco smoke into the body, it would be if the child is not appropriate. Map narrowed to smoke because of the danger to children if they think the smoke should smoke outside the restaurant out if the shop owner to customers smoking in restaurants has narrowed the restaurant will make it ineffective and no. Standard cigarette making and giving customers less if the owner wishing to attract customers or clients think that smoking should be thinking to find a place to smoke, but customers should not smoke in a restaurant because smoking is dangerous. It is hard to find reasons why restaurants should allow people to smoke. It is bad for them and other people. It may good for the owner to earn a lot of money because many customers like to smoke. But it is very bad idea to do because you are making people destroy their heaths as the same destroy of other.",THA
"In these days, prohibition of smoking is tightened more and more. But I don't think so much to smoke should be completely forbidden at the all the restaurants in the country. However, many reasons would be offered, I want to give an opinion that cigarette is one of the most popular luxury item. I think luxury items important for people, not only, cigarette but tea, coffee, and liquor. These items are not necessary for men, but they could make you pleasant, and that is funnily important. A person who knows the delight of enjoying luxury item seems to have a relaxed frame of mind. I think that attitude is one of the important factors to estimate a person. So smoking should be allowed at the restaurant, I think. Many people will criticize that opinion. For example, cigarette smoke, especially side stream smoke is harmful for not only a smoker but also people not smoke. But I think that problem will be solved easily. That is, dividing smoking area and no smoking area more severely. If a guest smokes in no smoking area, they warn him or take a more rigorous stand. We have a right enjoying luxuries freely, provided they are not crime.",JPN
"College is indeed more expensive than high school in terms of expenses. It is not always the case that all students can afford all the expenses, especially for Filipino families. Their parents may support them somehow but not all parents can. Some might not even have parents to support them. And some students are faced to be the only hope of the family to leave the poverty. Not all of us are lucky enough to be born from a rich family. Since college students are still on the process of getting their degrees and professional titles, they could only be qualified to apply on part-time jobs. Therefore, students, who really wants to pursue their education with insufficient money, take part-time job a major source of income. College inccures a lot of expensess, from tuition fee and books to projects and requirements, which requires giving off money. Some students are even self-supported. And in their case, they have to get all the possible opportunities to earn money in order to support themselves. Some students apply as Student Assistant(SA), like here in Adamson University, where the school pays half of the tuition fee in return of working part-time for them. Other part-time jobs may be in fast-food chains, mall, modelling, or if you're talented enough to apply as a singer on coffee shops or somewhere related. Part-time jobs are usually taken seriously by those from public colleges or private universities who happens to be unfortunate financially.",PHL
"Cigarettes have substance that stimulate nerve it called ""Nicotine"" that is narcotic drug, appetite suppressant and poison. Cigarettes bring about effects to smokers and people around smokers. Effects from smoke of cigarettes is an important principal that harm people's health around the world, it cause smokers risk danger from diseases such as cancer, heart disease, congestive heart failure and emphysema. If a smoker is a woman, cause have more opportunity to risk for miscarry and baby who is born may have weight lower than usual, it cause smokers may look older than usual because smoke should increase wrinkles on your face. Smoking cause metabolism raise than usual, so it cause smokers lose their weight. Smoking cause smokers extravagant money to buy cigarette to smoke and treat sickness. Smoking is illegitimate if you smoke cigarettes at restaurants that have air-conditioned, smokers and owner place must punish by fine at least 2, 000 bath. But at restaurants that not have air-conditioned, restaurant must have suitable zone for smoking it called ""Smoking zone"". I think smoking should be ban in all restaurants in the country because cigarette have more effects about everybody health even though people who don't smoking and children. If you want to smoking, I think you should smoke at personal place such as your home or an office. It can decrease pestilential disease for people at public place. Smoking don't have anything good, if you are smokers you should stop smoking it will give you live longer than people who continue smoke.",THA
"I agree that in a restaurant should people not smoking. It make atmosphere in the restaurant not good. In addition, it makes the people who are pregnant cannot come to eat food in the restaurant that have more the people smoking. However, the people who are own restaurant should warn the people who are smoking or notification them to know. Moreover, Ministry Public Health should fix smoke law in the public. Then the people should stop smoke in because it is the bad example for the children. There are many go to restaurant for dinner with family also have a children go with. Also, the children seeing you smoke, so they learn to do with you. This make today have more children who have age less than 18 years old smoking. I think everyone do not want you child smoke or drink alcohol. However, you should make the good thing to make them follow you. These can make the future's children are better and make our country have a good quality people than bad people. Also, the government should work hard more than last year about the law to make sure that in restaurant do not the people who smoking in there because someone do not like it. In addition, it can make economic in Thailand fall. Also, please pay more attention about this cause.",THA
"In my opinion I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because when people smoking their behavior may influence other people. Not the people all in this world like to smell the smoke. And even you smoke in the close room; people can still smell that smoke. It is not a good behavior to connect with people. Besides, I think when you smoke, you are kidding for your health. You don't care your life. And you don't protect your body. If you do that, I think you don't love your parents or you don't know what you do is deeply hurt your parents' heart. In other words if you want to be a good daughter or son you consider your behavior first. Besides, I never listen people to say that smoking is a good thing, I just listen some people and our government to persuade everyone not to smoke. If smoking is a good thing why not people bring up some point at this issue to support it. From know I just find that some people hope more one people to quite smoking so I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",TWN
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As we can see, nowadays the social competition is becoming fiercer. Every year there are more than five million college students graduate from school, which deepens the employment stress. Many graduated students can not find a job easily if they lack working experience. What's more, as the economic crisis has made great damages to the economy, many firms broke down or survive hard, which lead to the result of drops of employment rate. Today, only improve our ability greatly, can we survive in the society. To improve working ability, taking a part-time job is a good choice for college students. The benefits of having a part-time job have been listed under the follows. Firstly, having a part-time job can improve college students ability to do things well, leading them to a good acknowledge of the society and their future career. Through doing some part-time jobs, college students can gain many experiences and when they graduate from school, they will be more confident and adept to the society easily. Secondly, having a part-time job can make college students more good at communicate with others and establish a wide relationship. Thirdly, having a part-time job can earn some extra money for college students' life cost, which also can decrease their parents' burden. All in all, having a part-time job will benefit college students greatly.",CHN
"Most colleges and universities offer opportunities for students to make money while working for a specific department or program on campus. Besides the financial benefit this provides to the student, it also has the extra bonus of allowing certain individuals the chance to learn additional facets of their chosen career path. Funding for student worker programs comes either from the federal government or the school itself, meaning students who get these opportunities generally have guaranteed employment through school. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on your hand and foot, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. Keeping a part-time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success, time management.",IDN
"I agree with this statement. One of the reasons is that college students have to earn money than ever before. For instance, they have to buy a lot of textbooks which are expensive and they have to wear clothes which are not uniform Monday to Friday and so on. So they have to have a part-time job to earn money. And main reason why I agree with this statement is that they can go through various things in part-time job before they get a job. I had part-time job in spring vacation. I worked as a clerk in gift shop. The shop sold gift of Sumo Tournament in Osaka. I experienced a lot of things in the job. Since Sumo is Japanese traditional sport, a number of foreigners came the shop and asked us about use of goods in English or Chinese and so on. So I couldn't speak foreign languages but I had to tell them as a clerk. Each time I explained to them with gesture. To speak with gesture is a first experience for me and this experience would not go through without I worked the shop. I experienced any other valuable things. I think that they can learn by a lot of experiences through part-time job. Therefore I really agree with this statement.",JPN
"No matter the smokers will be kids or adults, smoking can cause the cancer for them and also heart disease. Nowadays, there are a lot of people try to smoke, and some of them addicted tobacco. On the streets, there are many tobaccos on sale and there are many flavor. Because of some tasty tobaccos, people loves to smoke and don't care about people who don't smoke. In the restaurants, there are also many kids, woman, and non smokers. If smokers keep smoking in that place, it seems that all people in that place are smoking because all of them smell the smoke already. The smoke also affect to the environment and people health damage. All smokers should care about other people who do not smoke. However, if they can stop smoking, they will have a good health. No one can do for themselves, they have to start from their own. So I agree if the restaurants do not allow people to smoke. It's not only save people in the restaurants, it saves the restaurants to be good place for non smoking area too. Besides, people will enjoy eating food and have fun time in the restaurants that no people smoking in that area.",THA
"I absolutely agree with that topic because a part-time job will make someone has a skill with other older people, studying in the college is not enough for the world business right now. The students must have a great moral together with the best knowledge as they can.

Actually, every time you doing job, you'll face much of the obstacle in your unable with something. Do not be waiting for that, asking the leader for fix that problem.

"Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. I am agree with this statement. We know in the cigarette there is many addictive material which one can made many diseases for our body. Smoking in public area not only danger for our smoker but also many people around them. Beside that, can make our lungs has many hole. Smoking is a tradition not only for Indonesian's people but also people in the world. I don't know why they have a bad daily activity like that. It is a government's homework about how to handling smokers to smoking in special area. If you smoking in public area it like you kill people around you. Because cigarette can make many disease and make a pollution. If you smoke in the restaurant, can make all of food can be contamination. Beside that, cigarette is a biggest donate for our country. If smoking should be banned, so this country has less income. If a cigarette factory is closed, society around that haven't a job. The cigarette factory must make some activity with our society for save our earth, for example plant the tree, clean up the garbage in the river and the sea, etc. So, the cigarette factory not only produce the cigarette but also save the earth. So smoking in the restaurant should be banned, the owner of the restaurant make a special area for all of smoker. So, at now smoker must stop smoking can be spent your money to benefit thing and make the air free pollution. So far as we know, now is global warming, we must save the earth from pollution.

"If smoking is still allowed at the restaurants in Japan, I think it would be better if it is banned sooner rather than later. Many places in the world and in the United States have already banned smoking in restaurants, and I think this is common sense because restaurants are supposed to be public places where anyone can go and enjoy themselves comfortably without having to worry about whether or not their health will be affected. Especially in the U. S., most of the food is already so bad for you that having the extra affect if smoking is almost just like slapping yourself in the face. Nonetheless, many bars continue to allow smoking, and I feel that this is more appropriate because bars are supposed to be places for adults primarily. This does not make it any more pleasant to be in a bar if you are a nonsmoker, but you have to realize that there are many adults there who have many ideas and different lifestyles. A good first step in this situation might be to just banned smoking at the family restaurants in Japan and leave it legal at the bars and other adult opinions.",ENS
"At the risk of providing an extreme view, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. The strongest argument for such a drastic measure is that of maintaining a certain level of hygiene and cleanliness at the eateries. Smoking should be banned for the same reason that pets are generally not allowed in eateries. Patrons who have paid to enjoy a good meal in a supposedly clean environment should not have to subject themselves to being enshrouded in smoke because of the inconsideration of others. From the perspective of an economist, this is termed as a ""negative externality"". Smokers may argue that it is their right to take a puff as paid customers. While they may not be wrong, I am of the opinion that there should be a balance between the degree of personal freedom allowed and the welfare of the general population. The need for this balancing act is the very reason why the country is governed by laws. The law seeks to protect the interest of the general population in the same way that the ban on smoking at all restaurants would protect the interest of the patrons in general. The detrimental effects that cigarette smoke has on the health of an individual are known and well-documented. It follows that exposure of the general population to excessive cigarette smoke should be avoided. ",SIN
" I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Entering colleges means children's growing up. Students should try to learn as much as they can during days in colleges. Because this is the time you needn't worry about too much life problems and have many chances to obtain new things. Especially in China, students have little time to do things themselves before being a college student. College time is good time to become mature. We can feel much through earning money ourselves. On the other hand, we can collect much experience. All this is good for us. There is always a time when you have to make a living by yourselves. The more practice how, the easier the challenges that future has prepared for you will be. What's more, many people destroy their future for the lack of enough things to do. These people feel bored and don't know what to do after being set free suddenly. Then, they do some no-meanings to pull the time like playing computers day and night. They then form many bad habits.

Smoker start to smoke with many different reason. Someone, their family member or their friends smoke. Especially teenage, they imitate habit from their friend. They think it is the trend.

The most important is the part-time job can give you money and help your family save money. If you can find money by yourself you don't need to tell your family to give you money that is the way how your family can save money. You should do part-time job if you have free time.

First, get a job which you really interested in. If your dream is a diplomat, you should consider working in a company that using English. It is painful that someone working in a not-wanted job. For example, I've worked in an English institution as a teacher of elementary students. And it has given me friendships with foreign friends and English skills.

Moreover, when the other customers come into restaurants which are filled with smoke and cigarette smell, not the smell of food, they will feel uncomfortable. Smoking at restaurants is unhealthy for non smokers who smell the cigarettes. According to some scientific researches, second hand smoke can cause diseases. There are not only smokers but also non smokers at restaurants. Since restaurants are public places, people should not harm anyone under the pretext of freedom. Some people claim that smoking in restaurants doesn't have to be banned and suggest making smokers' area.

"Lots of people say college life consists of four elements-schoolwork, love, part-time job, and club. Above all, part-time job, from my perspectives, is quite an indispensable part to make a college student mature and independent. Being not only financially but socially independent, college students indeed ""earn"" a lot by means of doing the part-time job. How to say? It is when students try to earn money and be responsible for their works that would really become a ""half-adult"" in the process of training and growing up. Because they are not socially and financially supported by family, they try to appreciate the real side of this society or world. They little by little know how hard it is to get so few pays especially after dedicating their whole energy, time, and some others things to their jobs, and they would then naturally never take getting allowance from parents for granted. On the other side, they might get socially independent under the cooperation and negotiation with their co-workers and boss. Learning how to manage their emotion and sentiment becomes a necessity to survive for them, and they must throw away their diploma no matter how well-educated they are. Meanwhile, EQ management is emphasized than IQ is, and the protection from family is no longer available. In a word, I must declare the importance of part-time job for college students, because what they learn by doing the part-time jobs can't be procured by parents in comparison.

For example, working during midnight has more paid but it is unhealthy for students and may bring providing problems. Above all, too many social activities decrease their passion on studying and they don't have enough time cultivate relationships with their books. On top of that, a collage part-time person should interact with many social people. That may expose them on a not simple environment unlike their university. It will be dangerous to them. Not to say working in pub, even work as a tutor or babysitter should be aware. If they bring the social bad habits like cheating or passive thinking back to their school, it may also cause negative effects on their peers. In my opinion, it is always the best policy to do perfectly what the role a person is now. If being a student, just complete the duty of studying to the best.",TWN
"Nowadays more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. It's quite common to see students rushing from school to workplace. On this phenomenon, different people have different views. For my part, I think it's important for college students to do so. In fact, some people may think that it's a waste of time for college students to take part-time jobs because they can't get much money and it will be better for students to spend the time on study. However, I don't agree with it. In my opinion, although the most important thing for us is to study hard and get high marks in the final examination, part-time jobs do more good than harm to college students. As we all know, college is not only a place to read books and do homework; it provides us with all kinds of opportunities to improve ourselves. And taking a part-time job is one of the good ways to broaden our social experience. We can better understand what we have learnt in books and we can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which is very good for our job-hunting in the future. Furthermore, we meet all kinds of people when we take part-time jobs so we have to learn how to deal with them. That is, we can learn how to get along well with others and it's useful for us to enter the society. In a word, the advantages of taking a part-time job overweigh its disadvantage. It's important for us to have such an experience during college life and we will find it is really of help.",CHN
"I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants include people from all ages, from the young to the old, and they are places for people to eat and enjoy their meals. If smoking is allowed at restaurants, those smokers will pollute the surrounding air. Not only smoking is harmful to the individual himself, it also has an adverse effect on the people near them. In terms of health, innocent parties around those smokers, whom are called second-hand smokers, may become prone to sickness. Furthermore, smoke particles will be left on the body of the first-hand smokers and his surroundings. Thus, if the next person were to be in contact with these particles unknowingly, they became third-hand smokers, which are in fact much more harmful for them. In this case, not just the smoker himself will suffer from chronic illnesses like lung cancer; the blameless parties around him will also be affected. Secondly, the smell from the smoke may be so overpowering that it covered the pleasant smell of the food. Especially in air-conditioned areas, it takes a longer time for the smell of smoke to be dispersed from one place to another. This decreases the happiness level of the customers as they no longer are able to eat with full satisfaction. Lastly, it is to protect the businesses of the restaurants, which in turn helped in the growth of the economy. In the case of Singapore, most people choose to go to indoor restaurants without a smoking corner. In conclusion, for benefits in the long run, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ",SIN
"I don't accept with this, because in Thailand, parent usually give their children money when they are studying. Parent usually think student must study full time, so parent don't allow them to do part-time job. They think it is not time to work when they are studying but they should work as they want after graduate. Someone said that If you do part-time job, you will gain experience. I accept with this but, experience can come from other way not only doing part-time job. For example, I can attend any activity in university, study about thing that I interest to get experience. I do not care about money, someone do part-time job because of money. Making money by oneself is good but, It will be bad If I can't manage my time or I work too much, I would be retired from university and I think it is not worth to try that. For someone who sure that you can manage your time, I support to do part-time job but for me, I will study fully to get good grade then I would get a good full-time job and earn money. So it is not too late to make money after graduate but It is important to get experience and knowledge when I am studying. And It is not important for college students to have a part-time job.",THA
"College students who take a part time job derive a lot of benefits. A part time for job is important for college students because they can help their parent to full fill the cost of college. For some people that often joint organization in the campus. A part time maybe not for some job, but for take a rest, but the student that have part time, but they not have some want to do, they make the time useless. House work is also job, so we can do house work in a part time. The people that have more creativity, it is can also to distribute their ability in the campus to their job, so we can increase our theory in the class and can practice it in the job and they learn new experience. A part time for job, not only to help our parent, and practice our ability, but also to look for a new experience that became our teacher in our live later after we graduate from college. By part time work they can also earn some money. Actually, the people should make use full all their time with doing something that it can use full for all people or for our self.",IDN
"There are two main kinds of university students. They are categorized by their economic situation, that is the income of their family. The first type will be rich students. What rich means here is that they have sufficient money to pay the fee. And for these students to have a part-time job is not important at all. The second type is the poor ones. Their family income is not enough for them to pay the fee even with the support of government grant. So part-time jobs will be vital to them. To conclude, part-time jobs are not important for most of the university students except those are in need. Part-time job(except private tutorial) by nature is not for learning, it is for earning money. Most part-time jobs undergradate students can do are labour work. If the purpose of the 3-year studying in university is to learn in every aspect, part-time jobs will be a waste of time. These part-time jobs require employees a lot of time. Some of them like some friends of mine have to work overnight. Given large amount of energy to work, they can hardly concentrate on study for most of the cases or just lose the euthisasism to learn. If they have to learn things like financial knowledge, communication with others or things outside classes, part-time job is enough but not necessary. University is already a good platform for students to achieve what they want. There are abundant resources for students to learn like the society, club or the events organised by school, department or faculty. It is not a good choice to have part-time jobs with the risk of losing passions to learn and waste the precious resources provided by the University. And time is precious as the University life sustains for three limited years.",HKG
"Imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy your meal because of the smoke coming from the table of others. Banning smoking in public places should be completely done by the government. Banning smoking in public places isn't just a question of taking away one group's freedom for the benefit of another; it is something that is in the interest of people as a whole. It comes down to a decision between the health of a whole nation versus the freedom of a minority. Arguably by allowing smoking in public places it is the freedom of non-smokers that is being restricted because second hand smoking is more dangerous. Second hand smoking increases the risk of heart attack and heart disease. The only effective way to avoid the effects of second hand smoke is to insist on a smoke-free environment. In response to it smoker's and non-smoker's choice shows that everyone is being affected by smoking being banned in public places like restaurants. During the course of the meal a cloud of smoke is now no longer a bother. Because there are now designated areas for smokers and non-smokers someone could enjoy a meal without being uncomfortable. At the same time, a smoker is made uncomfortable because the restaurant is a non-smoking facility. Only the non-smoker can be completely satisfied. Is that fair in a free nation? If public places would compromise and designate certain areas for smoking and non-smoking then maybe everyone could be in a public area and be comfortable or satisfied.",PHL
"There are still remained restaurants which permit smoke in the hall area, but most restaurants are changing. It is not only because of legal issue. As all of us already know, nobody wants to smell it even though they are smokers. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can think about the health at first. Smoking affects not only the smoker but also the people around the smoker, so it is not smoker's own problem. People have their rights to say no in this situation. However, if it is happened in certain restaurant, it can be more seriously. Smelling the smog is not so pleasant for non-smokers or even smokers sometimes. It is very disgusting and can never be welcomed at all. Smokers should know this and they should care others when they smoke. Therefore, it is necessary to make a law to control this problem. Every people should keep their health even though it's indirect one. When smokers smoke, they should care others too. Even if banning smoking in the public area is trend these days, it sometimes happens. We should make the law to keep everyone's health from the damage of smoking. Because of these reasons, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country at least.",KOR
"Although many college students may find a variety of benefits in part-time work, I think that overall, college student should not have to have a part-time job and it is not that important for them. This is because most students have come to college to pursue their dream to get a college degree. Part-time work usually gets in the way of that, and most of my friends who have part-time jobs are always complaining about how stressed out they feel from work and how they feel that they have no time to do everything they want to do. Also, I very much value my social life, and if I work, I feel that I will only be able to find time to do school and work if I have no life. This is a bad image to have, and I do not want to have it, so I choose not to have a part-time job. If there are other college students like me who feel that there are other things that are more important than working, then it is obvious that it is not that important for college students to have a part-time job. Only the students who need to make money to help pay for their tuition should have a part-time job.",ENS
"I did not agree with college students have to do a part-time job because the main roles of them are studied hard and a little bit spent the time for their friends. However, part-time job can make money for the study but if they did not have time to review the lesson, they will do the score badly and effective in the long term about their future career. Many students have their reason of doing part-time job such as lacking of scholarship, spending a lot of money, lost for gambling, etc. but I think they should find another way to solve the problems instead of working part-time job that I will explain. First reason, lacking of scholarship, is the most problem that many people encounter. In the present, government has many scholarships for students that talented moreover students can loan the scholarships from government. Second reason, spending a lot of money, is depend on students that they can allocate their money well or bad. The last reason, lost for gambling, is very ridiculous because they have to solve the problem from the causes. In conclusion, I still confirm that part-time job did not appropriate for the students that they have to mainly study for their better things in the future.",THA

Generally, it is done to have that extra cheese or cream in your life, which will make your life more tempting and attractive. But sometimes it is done to meet all the expenses at the end of the month, and in fewer exceptions people do it as a hobby. Turning their spare time in the form of cash.

"I agree with the statement because having part time job can make a college student learn so many things and of course to earn money. Getting a part time job is an opportunity for us to experience what having a job feels like and may come handy in the future. When you're having a part time job, you will learn so many things like discipline and perseverance because in a job you need to follow the rules and will make a good impression to the boss. Having a part time job can have also many benefits like health insurance, dental, medical, vision and many more. The downsides of having part time jobs is that you're always tired and need to manage the times when you need to finish a school project or homeworks; nevertheless, you are only experiencing what will happen in the future and feel proud of yourself because you can balance school and work. Having a part time job is also fun because you will also meet many friends and different kinds of people which is a good experience.

"I agree with that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. To study from the books is not enough for students to learn. They have to go outside to discover the real world, and to earn money by themselves. If students have a part-time job, they will know how big is the world so they have to be strong by themselves. When I was a student, I used to play a lot and all I knew is studying and playing. After studying I would just play computer games all the day. I had a part-time job this summer vacation because I found that everybody was always thinking that I am just like a kid. I started to get in touch with my job teammates and the boss. I found that everything is difficult to me and that I have to find answers on my own.

To do so, I can learn more in my life and life will become more interesting. Now I am courageous to face the world which will come after graduating.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is really bad to our health.

Even the one who smoke everyday. Besides, I think restaurant is a place to relax and be comfortable with other or yourselves. Think about this, when we are funny with something but have to recognize our life, then will be felling bad. So, if someone understood it but really cannot stop it and insist to smoke, then please think more about other people just follow the rule and find a proved place to smoke.

During this process, you will know how difficult your parents make money and you may cherish the money they give you and not waste them. When you do a part-time job, you may meet people who you are not familiar or even do not know, then you will communicate with them and make them understand you.

"I think part-time jobs can be beneficial to students to understand the importance of saving and money. This is because people only realize the true nature of money when it is self-earned. They are more protective and stingy with money that they have spent effort and time to attain. This will help in personal financing, teaching them to be independent and managing their time. In addition, these part-time jobs provide learning experiences that instill soft skills in people which is useful for future careers such as interaction with others and communication. However, this is only true if the student is able to maintain their balance with their studies. Part-time jobs often take up a lot of time and require students to exhibit excellent time management. Without this, the students would lose out because ultimately, college provides the degree for them to succeed and progress in the future. Compromising studying for a part-time job would not be worth the potential career options that one might receive. In this case, it is more beneficial for the students to completely dedicate their time to college studies. Therefore, it is important for college students to prioritize their college studies over their part-time jobs which they should only take up if they are able to have a good work-college balance.

They will never imagine how difficult finding a job is before you really find one. You will feel tremendous pressure in the job market at the same time.

In the case of the poor students who can't afford the expenses in college, whether they like it or not, they have to have a part time job if they still want to continue studying in college. Since studying college is very much expensive aside from tuition fees, there are also transportation fees, allowance, miscellaneous fees and others.

"I disagree with this opinion. I have three opinions. First, if smoking is banned in all restaurants this may begin a trend in other establishments such as bars and nightclubs. Eventually retailers would follow the trend to ban smoking in shopping malls. Shoppers could also enjoy a smoke free shopping experience. Franchises and larger operations may be able to survive the decline in business. However, the small restaurateur would struggle with the lost sales from smokers. The restaurant industry would suffer not only from local business but could also lose business from tourists. Second, business tax revenue for the government would be reduced due to slow business. Small restaurateurs would be forced to close their businesses. Some would even go bankrupt by attempting to turn the business around. The government would need to offer incentives for restaurateurs to remain in business. Third, the casualty insurance industry would also profit less due to lower premiums. Many small insurance brokers serving the commercial business community would suffer from lower profits. A non smoking establishment would have zero probability of a fire due to smoking. Therefore, there would be less liability from customer negligence. Based on the above reasons, I am against the opinion. This is supporting the business community.",ENS

"Let's ask ourselves, what is the ultimate purpose:To make money? or to improve our academic skills? I believe that the college student must concentrate on their studies. For this reason I am against anybody working during their college days. This is a very short 4 years in which the student can make great advances in their specialized field of research. There will be plenty of time after graduation to work but there will never be such an opportunity to make such an in depth study free from mundane worries. The problem with working while going to school is that they will become distracted, tired and eventually lose their concentration, finally their studies will falter. It is too much to worry about in addition to their schoolwork. They will have long hours, late nights, standing all day with the burden of responsibilities which can wait until after college. I understand that young students are in a hurry to grow up, I feel it's our social responsibility to make sure they take the time to enjoy life too. They may even be pressured into after hour meetings where drinking is involved. For these reasons I am completely against the college student taking on too much during these precious years and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed.

Hence, smoking is unhealthy habit. It should be banned in restaurants. On the one hand, it is unhealthy; on the other hand, smoking in restaurant is impolite especially western country.

"College life really has a lot of stuff going on. There are exams, homeworks, projects, papers and exams once again. Having in mind that this very stage in our lives will, in one way or another, be very determining of our future somehow pressures students to put in extra effort. It certainly is one important part of our development as it trains towards the career we desire. But apart from that, it also trains us to be independent and resourceful individuals of service. That is why getting into part-time jobs could also be very beneficial at this point. College students are encouraged to get involved into part-time jobs since these can provide some experience in the working arena. It would be conducive for graduate students who are transitioning from student life to the working world. They would know what to expect out there. Apart from that, these jobs and experiences can train students to handle bigger responsibilities. Sure, college loads us with enough of them. However, these part-time jobs provide trainings that are a step further from what college and schooling offers for they train you to handle responsibilities in which not only your own interest is on the line. In college, we are trained to comply to the professor's requirements and adhere to the school's regulations. On the other hand, part-time jobs will train students to comply to the general public's expectations and adhere to the regulations of the bigger community. These jobs ' benefits, however, are not limited to the development and training they can offer. Indeed, part-time jobs are very beneficial to students. Besides, wouldn't it be nice and rewarding to receive money out of something you sowed yourself and not having to rely on your parents ' allowance all the time?",PHL

"I do not feel that college students should have a part time job. Firstly, studies should be the main focus in a college education. Students who are too preoccupied with their jobs will find it difficult to concentrate on doing well in school as working is bound to take up much of their energy and time. This is especially true for those working in food and neverage industry as well as sales. These jobs are both time consuming as well as physically and mentally tiring. Although it is useful to supplement their allowance, I feel that it is not worth it to sacrifice time to earning money. This is because as the old saying goes, ""time is money"". Of course, there are exceptions when students are in need of cash to pay back student loans and pay for school fees. In such cases, it is understandable that students will want to have a part time job to clear their debt. However, this is not the majority of students. Also, parents should bear some of the responsibility for their children's education. It is difficult to concentrate on both studies as well as financial responsibilities and hence I feel that the students should not bear the full brunt. Overall, students should be focussing on doing well and completing their degrees. Then, when they start working in future, they can pay back their loans and be filial to their parents. ",SIN
"There are two type of work. First type is full-time job and the second is part-time job. Full-time job is a type that the workers must spend a full time in a day. Of course, the salary that the workers get, usually gave in a period of time. But, in the part-time job, the workers usually just spend some time in a day. So, the salary that they receive equivalent with the time that they spend. But if the time that we have was limited, part-time job is the good choice to get an income. College students are classified as an adults because they usually have turned 18 years old. At age, is sufficient for college students to try something new and have their own income. Because of they still have a primary job as a students, their time also limited. From the definition of part-time job, they are qualify to join the part-time job. Beside of part-time job make them have their own income, part-time job also can be a media for learning by doing.

"I disagree with this statement for a few reasons. There are currently a high percentage of people in the country who smoke and they are being ostracized from their patrons. Smoking on the street is starting to be outlawed in many cities and the number of places where a person may smoke is slowly decreasing. If a person cannot smoke in a restaurant, there will become very few places for them to do so. Ultimately, smokers will be left with nowhere to smoke but their own homes, and I do not need to mention the impact this will have on the millions of children whose parents smoke. There is no reason why restaurants cannot continue the trend of separating smokers from non-smokers with sections and partitions. This technique is very effective and satisfies both parties of smokers and non-smokers to the extent whereby non-smokers can only complain about the looming clouds of smoke in the glass box next to them which is pedantic to say the least. Of course, there are still restaurants where this set-up is non-existent, and this is undoubtedly a cause for grievance among non-smokers and smokers who prefer a clean environment while eating. The solution is to enforce mandatory segregation for smokers and to ensure that there is adequate ventilation to expel the smoke. This is a solution that I have already stated works and is a win-win situation for both groups. There is no need for a complete ban on smoking in restaurants when there are other alternatives.",ENS
"Many students now have part-time jobs to earn some money. Some of them wash dishes at restaurants. Some teach children on weekends. They all do jobs in their spare time to earn money. On the one hand, they can really live better with more money. On the other hand, they don't have enough time to study. So part-time job is not necessary for a student. Students need time to study, but part-time jobs take over their spare time. Study is the most important job for a student, so one cannot give up time which should be spent in studying. If a student do part-time job, he will lose more than what he earns. Part-time jobs are not safe enough for students. Compared with other places, campus is the safest place for students. Students do have to get out of their campus to do their jobs. This means they may be hit by cars or stolen. All dangerous things may happen to students. Some students may have financial problems and they may take part-time jobs to solve this. But they should consider this problem once more. Is part-time job the best answer? No!

Smoking in the restaurant will disturb the comfort of all the visitors. Actually, smoking is a bad habit.

People who smoke not only suffer from the lung cancer and other illnesses that result from smoking, but also let the no-smoking people in the polluted environment. How to solve such a difficult public question is faced with everyone. Imagine a scene, when you and your friends are having a delicious meal in a quiet and tastefully laid out restaurant, , someone next to you is just puffing on his pipe, what is your feeling now? Would you keep in a mood to enjoy the meal? A ban that is against smoking in public places is really in a great need. Nowadays, the campaigns which are to oppose smoking are countless. However, the results are not so effective. As far as I am concerned, one of the most significant reasons is that the government does not pay much attention. The tobacco exportation plays a very important part in the economy. The concerned apartments would not be please to sacrifice such a major incoming. Secondly, the films and soap operas on TV set wrong values for the adolescences. There're a great number of shots of smoking. As a result, the teenage are just in those ages with a great interest to copy what they see, especially their heroes. In a conclusion, if we are stick to stop smoking in public places, we should imbue our children with such a thought that smoking is harmful, not only to you, but to everyone around you. Also, we should urge our government to take some actions to prevent such things. We believe if we work together, the smoking will be defeated one day.",CHN

Certainly it is difficult to earn all money to live from the part time job but they can earn a part of money to live. I think that is the first step to independence from parents. Other reason is that if we have a part-time job it is advantage when we have a permanent-job. I think to work as part-time is a study and when we work in the near future the experience will help us.

"There are many students think that having a part-time job is important for them since they can get the experiences of working and earn money. In my opinion, it is not important for university students to have a part-time job. In my point of view, having a part-time job in the school is rather less important than getting good academic result and joining different schools activities. There are three main reasons. First, university study is already our last 3 years of studies in the whole life. We should study well and at the same time joining different activities. It is time-consuming for us to have a part-time job. Second, job experiences can be earned after we have finished the university studies. There are much of times left after the end of our studies. Third, it is not necessary. Between scholarships and the support from parents, students should have enough cash to live on without having a part time job to earn extra money.

"No I do not agree with the statement. While there is no doubt that smoking is bad for one's health, banning it is not the way to go. This is because completely banning will open the floodgates to many other things to be banned. Other than smoking, many things are bad for health too, such as oily fried food and sugary soft drinks, should they be banned too? The answer is no. This is because whether something is ""good"" or ""bad"" can be subjective and relative. Oily fried food if eaten everyday will have very bad effects one's health, but if eaten in moderation, negative effects on health will be negligible and offset by the pleasure that it confers on the taste buds. From this example can be seen that every decision made has to be seen in a context. We are a mature and sophisticated society with citizens who can think for themselves. Banning will be too heavy-handed. Guidelines about no smoking in restaurants would be a better alternative. The restaurant owners should be allowed to make their own decisions as to whether smoking should be allowed on their premise. A great idea would be to follow Singapore's example and have ""yellow boxes' ---designated areas for smokers. In this way, both smokers and non-smokers will be appeased. Just make sure that smoke do not drift over to the non-smokers' area. ",SIN
"I think that college students have a part-time jab before graduating from university. Because they didn't have any experience about a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a fresh man, I worked Lotto Riau as a part time worker for one year. And my parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and got little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than I didn't have it. There is a bad aspect. It means I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought whether I stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young. So I had many chance in future and I had to go to army. Now I don't regret it. If I turn a fresh man, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be succeed than no having experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.",KOR
"As far as college student's having a part time job, I will suggest 3 supports on the below. First of all, students are born to study other than having part-time job with spending a lot of time. Nowadays, most of part-time job owners force student to spend a lot of time by making the contract filled out when they get a job. However, once the contract is submitted to the employers, it is extremely hard to reject their offer even if they have a lot of homework that should be dealt with on a day and night. Therefore, it would be better not to start to avoid such traps. Secondly, instead of trying to get money by having part time job, they can take alternatives. When we take a closer look to colleges, there are a lot of scholarships designed to students. Thus, for college students, it is reasonable to take a way to get a scholarship by studying hard instead of killing a lot of time. Finally, it can do other meaningful activities in college rather than having a part- time job. The experience students can get by part-time job is not important as students can go through this experience when they get a real job after graduation; however, the experience regarding meaningful activities never will not be back once this period is over. Considering that it is not easy to take 2 rabbits at a time because of the time limit, we can conclude that students should experience more meaningful experience that needs less time.",KOR
"Have you ever seen this situation? Part time job is just short time job. The job gives a small fee. The fee is just small, but student is good chance buying they want. I think that part time job is good experience. Many experience is helpful anyone's life. If chance work part time, you'd batter work. But if you are high school student, you don't work part time job. When do you real work, the experience give you variety help. That job is university student's work. This day's part time jobless seeking job. Many people seek job just older people. People who go to study go to English nation are part time job. Because that people learn English through part time job. Communicating the foreign people, they learn English. It is good method studding foreign language. So student who go to other nation, go the working holiday. There are a variety of part time jobs in the world for people. There are many advantages when in working part time. We think not easy to make money. So we save the money. I get to know that our parents are working hard for us as well.

It impossible the restaurant is should not have smoking anywhere but the restaurant is must have Non- smoking for everywhere. If the restaurant have Non-smoking I believe most of people will go to hear a lot because it safety and useful. So the guest will happy and you will see smile of people eating and drinking in restaurant. Sometime someone want to smoking so the restaurant is will have the Conner in restaurant for smoking.

"During the summer following graduation in high school, students are searching for a way to equip themselves to be a diverse college student. As for me, I applied a foreign part time job in the US to realize my dream of traveling abroad. I worked at the Yellow Stone National Park as a waiter in a hotel. Of course, this kind of hard job is far from a comfortable trip. However, I enjoyed it a lot. My job was to clean up the rooms and the wooden house outside where the sun shine burned like a fireplace all day. What's worse, the cars in the wooden house we used to carry things are much heavier than those provided in the hotel. All of my partners prayed every morning for not being assigned to word there. It was me that asked my boss to make me work in the wooden house. I can't stand seeing the upset faces of whoever had to work there. My boss was astonished of this. She said, ""A Taiwanese girl? Aren't worried about getting dark skin?"" I said, ""No, I love sunshine. "" So that was it. On the first day I worked there, I got failed to pull that heavy car and got hurt by it. Fortunately, my friends helped me to see a doctor, and my boss paid all the money. The experience of having a part time job added warm and hard-working attitude in my personality which is unavailable in textbooks. I think a part time job is important for college student as a way to build good habits in life but not a way for earning money.",TWN
"Whether is it important for college student to have a part-time job or not? This is a great problem. There doesn't exist a common answer. Firstly, we must have a clear understanding of University study, which includes theoretical study and practical experience of learning! Of course, we have a large number of chances to do the theoretical study. But the practical learning isn't the same enough. A part-time job is a kind of social practice that gets material and spiritual rewards by paying physical and intellectual labor to some specific organization or individual. So a part-time job occupying reasonable time benefit us. However, we must remember clearly all the time that the main purpose of our college life is studying which ought to take most of the time. So no matter how many you can get from your part-time job, keep yourself studying most of the time. Always remember that studying well is the largest expectation of our parents. As a matter of fact, we will have many chances to participate in social practice. In short, take a part-time job only when you can master all of your courses. For us college student's focus on learning is the most important.",CHN
"Nowadays, the most college students always have a part-time job and learn with together, because some student was poor and they want to learn something from workplace. And some student want to learn about a job and earn money too. So it's a good ideas to think to have part time job when studying. There are many advantages of part-time job. The followings are some reasons that I can think of having part time job now. First, It's helping parent in terms of finance for student don't overuse money however, some student is the rich. So they may think that part time job is not suit for them. they may spend money very comfortable and don't know the difficulties in lives like poor students. It can make part-time job. Second, student will experience form real part-time job. And it learn new think that don't fine in classroom. Finally student will save money for pay everything both private and learn expense The part-time job for college student I agree. Student should make a part-time job, because it will help parents already. The part-time will can learn about a job.

"For me the importance of having a part time job for college students depends on the situation of the family of the student. Because in the Philippines, bades on what I've watched in news and learned in school and etc. Many Filipinos are experiencing poverty which makes many Filipinos not able to study or go in school. Even they want to study they don't have the opportunity or chance to go in school because of having insufficient money. This problem makes those filipino that wants to study buy not capable of paying the tuition and other requirements realized that it is important for them to have a part time job in order for them to attend school. All of us needs education because this is the only thing that others cannot steal from us. Education is important for us because it teaches us responsibility and because they got to learn that his/her parents wont be with them all their lives to support them or to give them what they want. They got to learn how to earn their own money. It is important for us college students to have a part time job for us to be able to lessen the expenses of our parents and in case we need something and our parents cannot provide us money, we can buy it from our own money that came from our work without asking for the help of our parents.",PHL

"I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons why smoking should be prohibited. First, smoking is bad for our health. Smoke contains some harmful substances and they often cause cancer. It does harm not only to a smoker himself but also to people who are around him and never smoke because of him. So smoking is not good at all. Second, smoke has very bad smell. It gives pain to people who are around a smoker and do not smoke. At restaurants there are little children as well as adults, who dislike smoke. Lastly, at restaurants there are many families, lovers, friends, and so on. If someone starts smoking at such place, they will feel badly and their happy time will be soiled. Only one smoker sometimes brings discomfort to everyone there. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In addition, I hope that tobacco completely vanished all over the world. If so, I can live more comfortably and happily every day!!",JPN
"Some people think that ban on smoking at all the restaurants is bad. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons why I think so: other people's health, bad smell and clear environment of restaurants. First of all, other people's health is very important. But, if some smoker smokes at food restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the old and babies, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarette's smells very bad and it can make people feel unpleased. The people have a right to breathe good smell at food restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at food restaurants, the restaurant's environment can be dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarette can go into the food. Also, the food restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarette. So, because of the three reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",KOR
"I agree this statement. First of all it is because the college student should not only study. I think that it is important for the college student to experience part-time job when he or she works in society in future. But, if the college student neglected studying, it is putting the cart before the horse. The balance of studying and part-time job is also studying. I think that part-time job is the first step which he or she experiences society. So, he or she will have various experiences, but those all are called society. If he or she don't such an experience and come out in society, he or she will be instantly confused. Therefore he or she should have such an experience as soon as possible. Second, probably most college students had gotten allowance until now. So, he or she understood difficulties of earning money. If he or she works at a part-time job, he or she will be able to understand correctly the importance of money and difficulties of earning job. If he or she does so, he ore she will not waste instantly. Naturally there are other various opinions. It is sure that there are bad points in which studying tends to be neglected etc. However he or she will get things beyond them. From the above statement I agree this theme.",JPN
"I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants in Japan. This belief springs from an awareness of the harm that smoking does not only to the smoker, but to persons in the surrounding area as a result of secondhand smoke. Not only is it unhealthy to have nearby persons smoking while one is eating, but cigarette smoke also detracts from the pleasantness and hygiene of the environment. When smoking was first banned from restaurants in the United States, there was a huge outcry from both smokers and the owners of the eating establishments. Restaurant owners believed that business would plunge. Later studies showed, however, that there was no effect whatsoever on business performance figures, and that public opinion strongly supported the move. Today, restaurants are cleaner and more hygienic, and provide an attractive atmosphere more conducive to leisurely conversation as a result of the ban on smoking. Public smoking also sets a poor example for children and young people, who see smoking as a natural part of everyday activities rather than being educated in the harm caused by cigarette smoke. Overall, banning smoking in restaurants and other public places contributes to improved health, cleanliness, and atmosphere. I strongly believe that Japan should follow the model set by restaurants in other countries, and should initiate a complete ban on smoking in restaurants.",ENS
"Certainly, smoking is a bother for others. But smokers pay heavy tax when they buy them and in Japan tobacco is legal over 20 years old, so they have smoking rights and they can smoke at the restaurants. Tobacco is a one of luxuries and many smokers may want to smoke during or after a meal. They often say It is very delicious that smoking after a meal or drink. But non-smokers have rights of not to be exposed smoke naturally, too. Tobacco smoke is very harmful especially for other people, and there are many people who don't want to be exposed to that smoke. We just want to enjoy eating or drinking delicious meals and talking with friends at the restaurants. How we can solve that simple question? Now, there are divisions into smoking and non-smoking areas at the stations or universities and so on. So it is necessary that dividing smokers from non-smokers at the restaurant, too. To dividing smokers from non-smokers completely, it may be able to make a progress improving relations between smokers and non-smokers. And we have to understand each other, smokers and non-smokers. After appropriate measure of smoke, smokers can smoke at the restaurants in Japan.",JPN

Smoking affects not only the smokers' health, but also the people around. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places, especially in the restaurants. Every human being who stays in the restaurants, they have the right to ask for the better surrounding. The customers pay for dinner, so they have the right to possess and pursue the best surrounding. Smoking always affects the atmosphere, mood and also the health of the people in the restaurants.

Second, the restaurant is a public place so, it not suitable for allowing about smoking, because when the customers come with their children, it's not a good sample for them to see. And someday in the future those children may be copy that bad behavior. Third, if the restaurant is famous but, there have a smoking people in their area, it will make the customer think that this restaurant is not clean. Forth, some customers who is a healthy person come to have a meal and see a smoking person. They will not like and have a bad felling to your restaurant so, the owner's of the restaurant should be check all around the area to see that it is a clear area or put the no smoking's label in front of the restaurant.

"From my view, I totally agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Smoker may say that smoking helps them to relax and release stress. But the negative aspects outweigh the positive. It is harmful for both smokers and non-smokers. Cigarettes are also addictive because of the nicotine it contains. Smoking is very bad for health and it should be banned. Smoking has deleterious effects on the passive smokers in the restaurants. Several pulmonary diseases such as cough, bronchitis, asthma and carcinoma of lungs may occur as a consequence of smoking. In fact, about 3, 400 lung cancer deaths in non-smoking adults, caused by breathing in secondhand smoke. Although the money Government receives from taxing cigarette is very high, the cost of medical treatment for these diseases should not be ignored. Smoking causes a number of health problems such as asthma and lung cancer, which are expensive to treat. As a result of this non-smoking tax payers are forced to pay for the health costs of smokers. This is a very unfair situation. Smoking cost the economy at least 100 billion dollars in health care costs and lost productivity.",HKG
"Majority of people know that cigarette is very dangerous and give many bad influences to their bodies, also passive smoker. In addition, they also aware that smoking will consume much to their money only, furthermore they will get nothing just feeling enjoy for a moment. I also aware about that but personally I disagree if the government will ban smoking in the restaurant. Though, I always feel disturb with the smoker but I assume that government should take other effort to decrease influence of smoking. In the future, if government will ban smoking in the restaurant, we won't be able to think the condition of restaurant, they will be loss or maybe bankrupt because the guests especially men, however women likely to smoker after they eating will not come. Furthermore, we can imagine that there are a few restaurant only and certainly, it is bad fact to the people especially carrier woman and their families who prefer to eat in the restaurant because she has not enough time to cook and busy with other activities. They will confuse to choose place where they will eat. Alternative way to minimize bad impact of smoker who are the guests of certain restaurant, management of restaurant should provide smoking area that is allow the guest smoke. I am quite sure that it will not disturb other guests and restaurant still keep fresh environment. Beside that, in my view, although government will ban smoking in the restaurant, it will not work well and ineffective enough without awareness of the smokers. To conclude government should not ban smoking in the restaurant because it will make the restaurant loss and make the smokers unenjoyable to come.",IDN
" As we all know, some of the college students have or are finding a part-time job, like waiters, leafleteers, and shop assistants and so on. Some people think it is important, but some think it is just a waste of time. But I don't think some think part-job can be a major to us college students. First of all, and it is obvious that take a part-job can we have more money before we take it. We are college students, not middle school or high school students, and we are adults already. It's time for us to make money, maybe not all by ourselves but part of. And in the other words, we can reduce the heavy burdens that our parents take on their no longer broad shoulders. So that is about the money, and secondly, take a part-time job can also improve our ability. Maybe money is not that count for some person, but abilities is necessary. No matter what work you will do in the future, one thing that you must have various abilities. Something likes communications in all kinds of occasions. And as a college student who has more free time to do what he/she likes, I think take a part-time job can we have a rich life in university.

"Going through college is an integral part of life. It is part of the process one goes through in acquiring knowledge and experience in order to face life's circumstances. In living the college life, students are gradually trained to become actual citizens of the country wherein they practice their chosen profession. However, is it important for college students to have part-time jobs as part of their training? I don't think so. Although part-time jobs may indeed serve as a training ground for students before they become real professionals or workers, I believe that it is not necessary at all for students to be involved with these jobs while studying. Working in these jobs may only divert the student's time and attention away from their studies, especially for the freshmen. Fresh from the high school system, first year college students are still in the process of adjusting their time management. Aside from that, working while studying will be especially hard for those students studying in a trimestral system. I also believe that the opportune time will come when students are given the chance to practice their learned concepts at school. The opportune time that I am talking about is the on-the-job training program that students will undergo on their higher years during college. Even though I don't consider part-time jobs as a significant part of college life, I am not against it. If the students can handle their time and can benefit from these jobs such as earning additional income, they may work in part-time jobs.",PHL
" In my opinion, it's important for students to have a part-time job. But I argue that the job must be a proper part-time job. There are many advantages for a student to have a proper part-time job. For instance, a proper part-time job can help students to realize that no success comes from noting. It also enables students to be independent and build up their self-confidence. In addition, a proper part-time can make the students out of the ivory tower and give them lots of opportunities to know more of themselves and the society. In the same time, students can realize their personal value in society by having a proper part-time job. Of course, as we all known, everything has two sides. If we do not know the balance between part-time and learning, something bad will occur to us. In other words, an improper part-time job will bring many disadvantages to us. For example, an improper part-time job must occupy students' time and make them just pay their attention on money but not what they should to learn. In a word, a part-time job is important for the students, but the students must keep a good balance between part-time and their learning.",CHN
"Air pollution issue is becoming popular in the media. This kind of pollution has a very broad area that includes smoke from cigarettes, smog from motorized transportation, smog from factories, and even waste of burning garbage. One solution which has been applied in several developed country regarding the smoke from cigarette is not to let people smoking at all restaurants all over the country. This law may seem to deny the freedom of human rights if people have a narrow point of view. People who disagree with this law must think too much about themselves that they can not see other's rights. It is true that the decision to smoke or not is up to the individual himself, but I doubt that those who decide to smoke realise that their decision has annoyed other's health. People who smoke generally have already known about the risk of smoking and they take it as a consequence once they do it. They do have a choice whether they take that risk or not, but what about others? Do they have a choice to inhale the smoke which produced by those who smoke? When this law enforced fully in all over the country, the healthy people may stay healthy. They may have their right to choose.",IDN
"I agree with it. There are three reasons. First, we can have good social experience before we join society. Second, we can get money for studying, living and enjoying a college life. Third, we can't have such an experience only when we are college students. For example, I work for a bakery now. I can study right talking, in Japanese we call it keigo. If I didn't work for this shop, I would not be able to talk it. Then, I live oneself. So, I buy many things, food, clothes and books etc by money which I get from part-time job. I practice living oneself in the future. By working there, I can meet many people, and I can spend good time with them. And, I can know many things which I don't know. For example, bakery wokers call packing bread soccer. I have worked for juku. I taught junior high school students English. They studied very hard. When I saw them, I wanted to teach them many things, and I studied very hard too. When I leave there, because I would be moving, I was very sad because I missed them. This is my good memory. In this way, I have good experience by part-time job. So, I think it is important for college students to have it.",JPN
"I partly agree with the idea of banning smoking. Smoking is very harmful for not only smokers but also non-smokers. We can easily see people smoking on the streets. Why do you think they smoke on the streets? I think it's because there aren't enough smoking areas. Even though public places such as big buildings, restaurants, theatres, amusement parks have their own smoking rooms, it's still not enough. Government has been trying to ban smoking, but it's practically impossible. No matter how much government raises cigarette price, smoking population is still increasing. If we really can't stop people smoking, then we should let them smoke under some conditions. First, government should make the strict rules and laws. Non-smoking areas must be expanded, and smokers can only smoke in the smoking areas. Second, if smokers break the laws, they must be applied the strict punishment. However, I'm not pretty sure about banning smoking at all the restaurants. I guess if we ban smoking at all the restaurants, it'll make it worse. Smokers will go outside to the streets and try to find the place to smoke. I think we should find the best solution to protect non-smokers and give a little more comfort zone to smokers.",KOR
"I agree that smoking should be banned restaurants to rapidly changing country. Because smoking can harm others indirectly, and it will spoil the atmosphere in the diet. All parties must have prohibited smoking in restaurants. Must be provided for them by smoking. It may take, but it must begin to have people follow. The government should set the strong rules for citizen. I will give you example in other countries where stating very strong law. For instance in Singapore any attempts to import cannabis or other drugs are punished with death by hanging, which applies even if you are unaware that they are in your possession. At the very least, in most countries, you will not be permitted to cross the border with the products still in your possession. Penalties for purchase, possession, and/or use within a given country can range from none to severe. Know the local laws. If Thailand can make such a very strong law and importantly all citizen willing to respect the law and act quickly in time can push our country to keep moving forwards to be the developed country in the near future.

We can get various part time jobs from the Internet sites like Albamon, Albachungook. We can experience various things. I can tell you part time job is a useful experience by next three reasons. First of all, we can learn sense of independence. When we are students, we just accepted money from parents so we couldn't know exactly the worth of money. By experiencing these part time jobs, we can earn some money without parents' help. Secondly, we can show our talents by part time jobs. For example, we can teach some students by private tutoring. It can get in Internet easily. It can be valuable experiences. Third, the part time job can be a social experience. We are preparing the future dreams, so we can experience early that from part time jobs. It's important to build our careers. Nowadays, many part time jobs are offered by various media, so we can choose one of them. Although all of part time job are not good, we can learn more things useful. I mean to say that we can learn sense of independence, talents and social experiences.",KOR
"Smoking is free in every country. And cigarette is a favorite food like coffee. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurant is selling a food. Food must be clean. But smoking has a lot of toxic substance. So non-smoker has damage. For example, non-smoker (women) can lead to birth defects. And the smell of cigarettes is disgusting. Many non-smokers have defects. If they want smoking they smoke in some place. They don't give damage for non-smoker. So, we need to completely ban at all the restaurants in the country. Everywhere we can smoke, many youth will smoke. Because they can see smoking. So we need to smoking place. Smoking has a lung cancer. The smell of cigarette, too. I am non-smoker. When I walk at road, many people smoking. I feel disgusted. Smoke person doesn't feel smoking smell. So, I think smoking place is very useful place. And we will healthy. And air will be clean.

"All over the globe, even quality education has its price. It leaves us with the question, Do College students need part time jobs in order to cope up with the expenses they will incur? In my opinion, it is better for the child to focus more on his studies. It is the parental responsibility of the parents to provide enough funds for their children who are studying in universities. It is their job to ensure that the child will be able to have enough money to cover his total expenses. It is the responsibility then of the student to do well in school for him to repay his parents hard works. Instead of getting a part time job, it is better if the child will save up his excess allowance for him to be able to help his parents in small acts. A child studies for him to acquire enough skills and training before facing the real world with confidence and knowledge. If the child will have a part time job, the child's time will then be divided which gives him less time for focusing on his studies. If the child gives his undivided attention to his studies, he will be more able to acquire more expertise. It would be more beneficial for the child to render his time fully to his studies for him to gain enough preparation. Also through not having part time jobs, it will lessen the burden and stress that school has already given on the child. So personally, having a part time job does have its pro which gaining money and real life experience but it also gives way for the child to have lesser time for his studies and perhaps later lose focus on it.",PHL

"Past Time Job I'm extremely agreed with this topic. As I see, I think past time job is a good experience for teenagers. Not only experience but also money. We'll gain from this. In Thailand, Most of students spend their free time to do past time job on summer. Many interesting places that they are interested in such as KFC, 7/11, The Pizza Company etc. In High school, I had a friend who spends her free time to do past time job in KFC. I asked her about why you considered doing this job and she replied me that it was so far that her university will be start so she thinks if she only spends her time at home she might be bored so doing past time job. She might gain more experience from her colleagues and also gain money to use in the university. It was a good reason that she earns money by herself so it's save her parents money.

"Work in a part time for college students is important. I agree with this statement, because I think it is very good for college student to practice to make a business or entrepreneurship. Besides that, there are many other reasons why to have a part time job is very important for college students is very important. Although college students are very busy with their study, but they still can doing a good activities like working in a part time. They can working in the restaurant, coffeshop, bookstore, minimarket, and in other places. Usually, working in a part time at 9 am until 3 pm or at 3 pm until 10 pm. So I think this activity is will not disturb their study process in the college. But, it can maked an activity before study or after study in the college. Most of people certainly often think that every college student is very busy with their study in the college. But I think if they can manage their time carefully, working in a part time is not impossible. And I think is it can managed carefully it's can't disturb their study and their study achievement. Because every things is depend of how individual to manage their time. There are many advantages of work in a part time for college students. For example, if they work in a part time they can increase their money so they can help their parents too. And then they can also pay the boarding house with their money from work in a part time, buying food, and others. Besides that, this activity is very important to practices become a good entrepreneur, businessmen, and many others work if the students graduate from their college.",IDN
"One of the pollutions that close to us is toxic fumes from a cigarette. A cigarette is a small roll of finely cut tobacco leaves wrapped in a cylinder of thin paper for smoking. I have seen the smoker since age that I can remember the things. I am second hand cigarette smoke. I don't like this but I can't avoid every time. People know that smoking is bad for everyone but cigarettes can be sold in every market and every shop and they are convenient to buy by everyone who has age more than 18 years old. I think it is wrong to do like this. If we want to stop, we will destroy all of them. My uncle told me that the old day, the teenager smoked for fashion. They believed that smoking make they're cool. And I think nowadays they still like the past. Some smokers smoke because they were serious. I think they have another solution but they don't try to do. A person in my family is addicted to smoke. He smoke and smoke. In a day he smokes more than a pack of cigarettes. I don't want him to be like that. Now he's very weak and dowdy. His healthy is extremely bad and not as lively as before.

"Smoking should not be banned in restaurants in a country. It is very difficult to ban smoking especially in Indonesia where the most income come from cigarette's taxes. Smoking has become a habit for people. Since it is impossible to ban smoking in restaurants, I will propose an alternative solution for overcoming smoking. First of all, the government can make the law of providing smoking rooms. Restaurants must provide smoking rooms for the smokers. This is important for both the customers and the restaurants. The customers who want a free smoking area will not be disturbed by the smokers and the smoke of the cigarettes itself. It also helps reducing the number of passive smokers. on the side of the restaurants, the customer will still enjoy the service and will not be annoyed also. Thus, it will bring advantages for the customers and the restaurants. Secondly, the government may increase the taxes got from the cigarette companies. By increasing the taxes, the government will have more money to provide smoking rooms in public places. For example, in smoking rooms can be built in the pedestrian area. People are not allowed to smoke in open air, so the government must provide smoking rooms built with the money they get from the taxes. It is the responsibility of the government. Finally, the government can also do seminars of smoking. As I said before, it is impossible to stop people from smoking. However, we can still save our next generation by reminding them that smoking is unhealthy. As a form of reminder, government can conduct conferences or seminars related to the bad effects of smoking. The target of this event is not only children and teenagers. Working people, parents, and even smokers can still be persuaded to avoid and stop smoking.",IDN

"Smoking can cause many health problems such as lung cancer, heart disease, and emphysema. Accordingly, it should not be allowed in restaurants especially ones where there are many children present. I recently read a study in which it was shown that many smokers simply decided to quit after smoking was banned in restaurants, and I think this situation would hold true for Japan as well, so it may be beneficial for the health of their people as a whole if they would ban smoking in their restaurants. That study also showed that heart disease was reduced by 5% in the five years after smoking was banned at the restaurants in that state. With this direct an obvious link between banning smoking in restaurants in increased levels of health in the populace, I don't see how there can be any other outcome than that smoking will eventually be banned in restaurants. So why don't nations and governments take the plunge and go ahead and get it over with because there's just no way that smoking will be allowed in restaurants forever. Having smoking and nonsmoking areas does not adequately address the problem, and the only way to fully address the problem is to just ban smoking altogether.",ENS
"As far as I am concerned, it is very important for university students to have a part-time job. The reasons why I argue are as follow. In the first place, you can apply the knowledge you learnt in the classroom to practice if you have a part-time job. Secondly, it will be a good chance for you to improve your soft skills, such as communication skills and time management skills, when you do the part time job. This can, in return, enhance your study back at school. Absolutely, this will benefit you a lot when you really find a job after graduation. Besides, you can earn the allowance from the job, which will lighten the financial burden from your parents who support your study. What is more, gaining working experience while studying in university, you may find jobs after graduation more easily. Some people may disagree that they believe having part time jobs will result in worse academic performance at school. I think, however, this is not the case. Multi-tasking is what we definitely will encounter when we join the society after graduation. Instead of escaping from the challenge, it is better for us to practice as soon as possible.",HKG

"Smoking inside restaurants is a big no according to dining etiquette because you are polluting the air that other diners breathe most especially when you are in an air-conditioned area. There may be portions of restaurants that allow its diners to smoke but still the smoke the cigarette emits still travels through the air thus still affecting the other diners. From my own experience, when me and my family were eating at a smoker-friendly restaurant I noticed that one-fourth of the place was designated to be a smoking area, the area was not sparated from the non-smoking area and that the place was air-conditioned so instead of having the aroma of the delicious food that everybody was eating, the restaurant was coated with the odor of scent of cigarette smoke. With the entire restaurant smelling very rancid, we weren't able to enjoy our food and after eating we told ourselves that we would not eat at a smoker-friendly place again. I think that smoking in restaurants should be banned because it is a sign of disrespect toward other diners. Restaurant managers should be aware of this and they should prevent people from smoking inside their establishments to be able to take care of the well-being of their other diners.",PHL

"I agree with this statement. Because I dislike tobacco very much personally! Although my personal opinion apart, there are lots of people who are poor at the smoke of tobacco. For them, it is hard that being smoked in a side more than a smoker considers. From the beginning, there are many arguments for and against smoking. Of course, I also understand that it is difficult to forbid smoking extensively legally now and that a smoker cannot part with tobacco easily so. However, passive smokers are injured their health than active smokers because the smoke that smokers exhaled includes a lot of harm. I cannot allow this fact. So I want smokers to try keeping off smoking in public places for non-smoking persons. Come to the point, restaurants are places to enjoy eating. I think that restaurants should be places which everybody can use comfortably. If someone smokes while person poor at the tobacco enjoy eating, how does he feel? Probably he will not be able to go on enjoying eating. I actually have found situations like this many times when I worked part-time in Italian restaurant. The restaurant which I was working had not divided the place into smoking and non-smoking sections. Therefore, there were visitors who wear the face which seems to be unpleasant by the smoke of the tobacco from the next table. I felt bad seeing cases like this. Although I understand that it is impossible to impose a duty of prohibition of smoking in all public places, I would like to define prohibition of smoking at restaurants at least so that everybody can enjoy eating pleasantly.",JPN

If you smoke, you will negatively affect the quality of your life especially in your older years. Many people claim that the lung cancer and throat cancer that people often get from smoking is one of the most heartbreaking ways to watch somebody die. The good thing is that if you are currently a smoker and if you quit right away, your body has the chance to heal and you may even reach a point where you are in as good of health as you were before you started smoking. However, many people have a very difficult time to quit smoking, so banning smoking at the restaurants may be one way to motivate them to achieve their dream of quitting.

"The experience gained from a part-time job is priceless. My first job was being a waitress at my parent's friend's restaurant. I thought being a waitress was to just be friendly and take orders and then the customers would leave you a generous tip for writing down their order so well. I had a positive outlook and attitude on my first day at work; however, things did not go as I had hoped for. First, I did not make myself clear enough to the cook when I asked him not to add garlic to a customer's dish. He mistakenly thought I said to add extra garlic to the dish and the customer was obviously not happy. Then, I spilled a cup of soda on a customer's blouse. To make things worse, one of the restaurant's most loyal customers demanded to speak with my manager because she accused me of spitting in her drink. Just from this one day of working, I learned that being a waitress meant much more than taking orders. You must live by the ""customers are always right"" motto and good communication is a must. I obviously was not a waitress for very long. My next job was a cashier at a supermarket. The ability to communicate well with patrons here was a very vital part of my job.

"20 years ago, smoking was cool and in style, but as time passes it becomes not as common as people come to understand the harmful effects and other issues. Nowadays, many people think it is much cooler to not smoke, as they will have a very difficult time to find a significant other if they are a smoker. If you are a non-smoker, you can date almost anybody you want to, but if you are a smoker, you can pretty much only date other smokers. This is because nobody likes the taste of an ashy mouth, and even just thinking about that gives me the shivers. Also, smoking is a rather expensive habit, and many smokers waste quite a lot of money on cigarettes or chew. I think the reason that people keep smoking is because of the nicotine, because it is a drug that gives them a high. The ironic thing is that you can achieve a similar high by doing healthy activities like working out which release good chemicals in your brain and body. Perhaps if the Japanese people knew about this they would have a much easier time finding a solution to the smoking problem in restaurants. Please tell them.",ENS
"I disagree to a certain extent. At this age, studying is more important than having a part-time job. Working is a life-long process but studying is not. Students should make full use of this golden opportunity to focus on their studies and achieve good grades for their future. This may enable them to apply for scholarships to further studies or work in reputable companies. They may be able to earn more and buy the things that they desire to compensate for their hard work over the years. When students have a part-time job, they may get distracted from their studies as they want to focus on earning more money to buy the things that they desire. This may cause them to neglect their studies and their grades may be affected badly which will be reflected on their transcripts. Upon graduation, they may not be able to enroll in good schools for further studies or work in good companies. However, some students may need to have a part-time job as their families are unable to provide for their school fees. They may work as long as their studies are not affected. For example, I had to work part-time during my polytechnic days as my parents were unable to afford my school fees. I ensured that the part-time job would not affect my studies. I would only work on the weekends during school days but I would work almost every day during semester holidays. I quitted my part-time job eventually as my studies were affected. ",SIN
"Although some people hold the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, others opposite it. The people who support that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China think that smoking is not only bad for the smoker's own health, but also has bad influence on other people's health. Secondhand smoke clearly kills people and the only way to control it is to ban smoking. Banning smoking in the restaurants is very good news for non-smokers, so that they can go out of restaurants and return home without nasty smelling. What's more, smoking kills thousands of people and this is the best way to discourage people from smoking. Others, however, look at this question in a totally different way and they hold that it's unnecessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. First of all, everyone has the right to decide whether smoke or not, some people believe that smoking can make them feel relax. Furthermore, the taxation of the cigarette contributes a lot to the National finance income. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants in China, a large number of people will lose job. At the same time, the customer of the restaurants will definitely reduce. As far as I'm concerned, smoking brings serious health consequence, and the pollution to other people's atmospheres also makes it an environmental issue. But I also think that people have the right to choose whether smoke or not. On the other hand, it's undeniable that selling cigarettes bring huge profits to our country and the people whose work related to it. So the best way to deal with this problem is to have the smoking area and non-smoking area in all the restaurants instead of banning smoking at all the restaurants.",CHN
"I agree with this opinion. You may say that college students should study hard so that they can play active in society, but it is not correct. I support this opinion with three opinions. First of all, they are able to make many friends. There are the younger generation and the middle generation and the older generation in workplace. Students may learn many things from working or communicationing or spending with middle or older genaration who live longer than them. Second, they learn the importance of money. You may understand that, we realize the importance of thing or how hard it is when we experience it. In my experience, when I started to work a part time that I earn 800 yen per an hour, I can't buy things which cost me over 800 yen easily. Third, my last opinion, they can earn money. How to use it is varied, for example, school fee, money for food, money for club activity, and others. One of these is money for travel abroad, now I save my money for this. I have been abroad for only once. It happened when I was three and hardly remmember. But, according to friends, teachers, and books, it is so great. When college students look at many things in abroad countries, they look at things with new eyes. Conclusingly, college students should work for a part time job and earn money, of course.

"I think that smoking should completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. Th ere are four reasons to explain my opinion. Let me introduce the reasons. First, the smell of smoking is so bad for not only smoking people's health bu t also non-smoking people's health. Perhaps smoking people accept some bad eff ects for their health, but people who don't smoke don't want to be a patient b ecause of smoking effects. And if there are some effects for non-smorking peop le, smoking people don't have any responsible for that nevertheless the people who smoked nearby the effected people who don't smoke is them. Second, if there is a restaurant in which anybody can smoke, the income will decrease. Because some of the people who don't smoke don't go to the restauran t. They hate the smell and the smoke, and they go through the restaurant as so on as looking at the smoking people in the it. Third, the restaurant in which anybody can smoke is bad for the people who ha ve been smoked and try not to smoke. If there is the restaurant, perhaps some of the people will smoke. Fourth, I don't like smoking people. So I agree with the opinion. I think that restaurants should be the place in which nobody smoke.",JPN
"I agree with this statement. In Japan, today, more and more people become to have their interest in health problem. Many smokers try to stop smoking and the number of smokers becomes smaller than it used to. Needless to say, smoking is not good for our health. And what is worse, it is said that cigarette is more harmful to non smoking people than smokers. Because of these reasons, many restaurants in Japan make non smoking seats and some of them already prohibit smoking completely. Of course, there are some opinions that it isn't necessary to prohibit smoking completely. They also insist that smokers don't smoke in non smoking places, so they don't annoy other people. But, when non smoking seats are full and if the guest hates smoking, there are some troubles. He has to wait until one of the seats becomes empty or put up with smoke and has meals uncomfortably. This situation is common and many people may have such uncomfortable experiences. To avoid this problem, smoking should be completely prohibited in restaurants. When smokers want to smoke, they should go outside and smoke so that everyone has delicious meals and spends comfortable time in restaurants.",JPN
"I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. The harmful side effects of smoking not only affect the smokers, but the second-hand smokers as well. Second-hand smokers are the people who inhale the smoke that the smokers exhale from their body. It is not only harmful, but even more fatal than the smoke inhaled from a cigarette. In a restaurant where there are many patrons enjoying a meal, many of them are non-smokers who dislike the cigarette smell. It is unpleasant to inhale the smoke that not only damages the body, but is also the result of another person's careless behaviour. It is polite for the smokers to leave the restaurant and smoke at a designated place because it shows consideration and basic courtesy. I firmly believe that non-smokers have the rights to stay within premises that are free from cigarette smoke. While smokers have the rights to choose to smoke, it should not be at the expense of innocent non-smokers who have chosen not to smoke. By allowing smoking within restaurants, non-smokers are at the mercy of the fatal second-hand smoke. By exercising this right, customers can have their meals in an environment that do not harm them in any way. Just like how hygiene is of utmost importance during food preparation due to health concerns, smoking is comparable to the effects of food poisoning, if not more severe. To conclude, the long-term side effects of smoking would harm people and outweigh any costs of implementing a no-smoking policy countrywide. In order to effectively implement the no-smoking policy, all restaurants should participate and enforce the policy strictly. This would positively contribute to the efforts to reduce the nicotine addiction worldwide. ",SIN
"The trend of part time job is very common in Pakistan as well as in other countries. Specially in European countries because parents cant support their child for their basic needs. It is very common specially in students. The students which are not rich or parents can't spend their money on their studies or parents cant afford them. Part time job mean to do job during studies there were many reasons for part time job. Students do a lot of work to support them self's. In morning they join schools, colleges or universities or at evening they do jobs. Some students do part time jobs just because of fun or some on the basis of their interest but really need it. I think its not necessary for college students and the students who do part time jobs because of their family problems. Parents insist their child to support the family. because their income was not enough to support whole family. And they also studied same time because of burden they lose their health or not able to do one thing properly. But some Child were very talented. They do job or also give proper time to their studies. Their academic record was good. I think if student don't need job then don't do it just focus on their studies with full concentration.",PAK
"Yes, smoking is bad for your health but this is only if you do it regularly or you smoke one pack a day or more. If you smoke like one stick per day or just when you are stressed from work, it is okay. Banning of smoking in restaurants in the whole country may somewhat be unfair to some. There are smoking lounge in some restaurants and it is a better way to solve this problem. There should be a separate area for the smokers and non-smokers. In that way, the non-smokers wouldn't be affected and be second-hand smokers. Banning won't be the solution of the problem in smoking. Do you really expect that people will completely follow that regulation? I don't think so, maybe except when there is a heavy consequence. This still depends on the respect and responsiveness of the people around you. In our country, I don't really see people smoking inside the restaurants. I could see people smoking but outside of air-conditioned places. I haven't seen anyone smoking inside the mall or wherever. Maybe smoking can be banned in some of the restaurants who don't have smoking areas, it would be the best. We must also take into consideration those who already gave effort of having smoking areas.",PHL

"I do not think negatively about smoking. Modern people are getting a lot of stress lately. Prohibited from smoking tons of people are allowed to reduce stress. However, in public places where children such as restaurants and hope not to smoke. Cigarette smoking alone is fine, but other people adversely affected by unwanted tobacco smoke should not think. I'm human and do not smoke cigarettes do not think I was wrong. But these days the trend is increasing, many women are smokers. These days, when you get down the street smoking a lot of women can be seen. Just like old times to smoke in secret, but nowadays women are not ashamed. Such features may even surprise you sometimes. I see a woman smoking is still an unfamiliar sight. Smoking is bad for women are affecting the baby. Most of the problems caused by this smoking are health. Many people would have some health problems for staying long in the public areas. Many people would fee unpleasant and don't want to come back to public areas. The public areas are for all people, not only for smokers. By prohibiting smoking in public areas, we can have lots of bents. Therefore, it is likely to create the correct smoking culture.",KOR
"I agree with this statement. There are two reasons. First, I think that college students should earn money to buy something they want by themselves. Indeed, their parents spend much money for their food, clothes and lessons in college and so on. But, in fact they are enough to earn money by themselves. So, I think they should not depend on their parents very much. Moreover, they are able to understand importance of money and how difficult their parents work to earn money for them everyday through a part-time job. Second, experience of a part-time job shows them a lot of things. For example, they are able to learn how to communicate with other people such as their boss or customers. After they graduate from college, most of them must work in society. If they didn't experience a part-time job, they may be at a loss when they are in trouble in their company in the future. They are also responsible for their job and they come to think more that they should not be late than when they go to college to attend the class. A part-time job is useful in living in society and makes them grow. Therefore, I think it is important for them to have a part-time job.",JPN
"Is it a good thing for college students to work part-time jobs? I think there are many advantages for college students to have part-time jobs. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study because of part-time jobs. But in my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. As we know, college students have fewer subjects and less pressure than high school. They have more time to do things they like. Having a part-time job is not a bad idea I think. Taking a part-time job has lots of advantages for college students. Firstly, part-time job offer them opportunities to apply what they have learned in school and demonstrate their abilities. Secondly, students can make some money through the part-time job, and it enables them to be more independent of their family and builds up their self-confidence. Thirdly, part-time experiences may be of great help to their future careers. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden their college lives and help them know more of themselves and society. But the more important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time job and their study. On the condition, I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",CHN
" In recent years, more and more public places such as some restaurants and pubs announced a ban on smoking. This tendency attracts much attention and caused a social debating. Many people especially those smokers think this limit their legal rights and require no ban for smoking. But more people agree on it. I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but do you know that living with a smoker is even more harmful? The scientific research shows that the second-hand smoke is much more harmful than smoke a cigarette directly. So smoking in public places can do harm to others health. So in my opinion, no smoking in public places is fair and legal. The second point is that smoking in public can have bad influence especially on young people. Children lack the ability of judgment and like to imitate adults. So they are more likely to smoke when they grow up or even before they grow up. Ban on smoking can teach them a good lesson: smoking is bad, don't touch it. Smoking in public places is dangerous. It can set things on fire and cause disasters. Many people lost their lives because of a cigarette. According to these reasons, I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. No smoking makes a healthier and more harmonious society.",CHN
"The college students should not only study but also work a part time job in the same time. Because the students do a part time job will get a lot of experiences from working. When the students work in the real job they can use the knowledge to the work. They can get some good advice from the boss and friends working in the same place. If they do some wrong work, they can ask the boss how to work properly. They receive the money and they can use these money to buy the thing whatever they want like the cosmetics, fashion bag, shoes, dresses, and mobile phone. College students who don't have money have to find part time job. They will know how hard when they parents work for the money to support them. They will not use the money to buy a very expensive thing. The government should help the college students to find the good job and protect them from selfish boss. The teacher should suggest a good and safe place for students to work. If students have problem they can talk with teacher and parents.",PAK
"I agree this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons. Firstly, it is because that it is good chance for college students to take part in job until they graduates from college and have a full-time job. This experience is useful to find their full-time job. In addition, they really understand that it is difficult and important to get money. They thank their parents and begin to spend money more carefully. Some people say that college students should study and join a club activity. However, college students can get important things from not only studies but also a part-time job. Secondly, it is because that college students can earn their tuition if they work as a part-timer. They are able to help their parents because tuition of college is high. In addition, college students can save money for some goals. In fact, a friend of mine works as a part-timer and save money in order to study abroad after she graduates from college. I can't think that she wastes time and her energy. Finaly, college students can meet and communicate with a lot of people. Talking with many people is quite meaningful for college students. They can get very important things from it. Also, it will be useful for them in the future. For these three reasons, I think that college students should have a part-time job.",JPN
"I couldn't agree less because it is none of the government's business. If restaurants are running their businesses correctly as stipulated by law then that's as far as the government's involvement needs to go. It's a matter for restaurants and their client base or the market if you like to call it that to decide. We don't need to call the government every time that we want to change the curtains or a CD and the restaurants and the people should be allowed to make their own decisions and run their own lives without too much government interference. The restaurants will either allow smoking or they won't and from that point onwards, it's up to the consumers to decide what they want to do. Some restaurants have already banned smoking in Japan anyway and that's OK if they're happy and their customers are happy then it is necessary for the government to stick their nose in. On the flip side though, if restaurants allow smoking and consumers are happy again it's been resolved without the government. Business owners and consumers are not all idiots or children and should be free to make their own legal choices about what suits them without having the government babysit every five minutes.",ENS
"At my childhood, my father always smokes near me. I thanked that smoke was not bad thing. But, at middle school, I saw video that smoking is so bad about people' body and near people. I realized that smoking is so bad thing. I am not smoking but I sure that my body is so bad. Because of my father, I experienced second smoking. I don't care smoking people. But, smoking people must not smoke near not smoking people. When I wait bus at bus stop, I smelled smoking due to smoking people. It is so bad that smoking near not smoking people. Sometimes, I went to restaurants, cafes and campus. I think that smoking is unpleasant thing. Government must make not smoking parts and smoking penalty system. When I will adult, I will ban smoking to my children. Because it is so bad to mom with baby. Smoking is also banned in playground and kindergarten. It gives benefits which are body healthy. I saw television that a famous comedian was so dead because of smoking. I was so scared when I saw his death. I go to computer fee room, I always feel smoking smell. Smoking is removed forever.",KOR
"Is it important for college students to have a part time job? I agree that college students works part time job. Because of Firstly, We can make money. College tuition have steadily increased every year. So, Parents worried about that pay College tuition. Nevertheless, We can't pay all college tuition. But, We can prepare pocket money. I think that It's not much money, but it will be extremely useful. Also, we can realize importance of money. Secondly, We can practical experience in advance. Commonly students of Korea lack sense of independence. Because many parents tend to overprotect to their children. But self-independence can increase by we put to it. Thirdly, We can develop one's aptitude. Nurturing one's aptitude difficult beforehand in Korea. Because course of study of Korea is teaching by rote. But nurturing one's aptitude would be easier through a varied experience. Finally, We can meet various people. If we live in the school and home, meeters are contain limit.

"Part time jobs are those small jobs which students at college level do along with their studies. The students are bound to do these jobs because they have no other way and their parents are poor so they cannot afford their children dues. The student does jobs in different small places. Their health is affected by doing part time jobs. They cannot study seriously. Their result goes down. With the passage of time when the burden of work increases on them. They become sick due to the work. They cannot take leave for even one day in college the lessons are left and salary is lessoned. So they cannot rest they have to go to college in morning and job in evening and after that they have to study. The students who are only studying have better results than the students with jobs. The government is doing nothing for these students and N G O or any other institution is working on this project. Government should collect funds for these students who are facing many problems in society. The youth is damage and is in danger. If they cannot seriously study obviously they will not have better jobs in future and cannot participate in the development of their country. In Pakistan a country, which is underdevelopment this country is facing many problems and students are facing this type of problems due to poverty. We should also do something for it.",PAK
"I believe that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, emphasizing on the importance for college students to have a part-time job will only add an extra burden on the students' shoulders. When it is said having a part-time job is important, due to the competitiveness of Singaporean students to be the best, it would seem critical for them to obtain a part-time job. However, the average Singaporean college student is barely coping with the workload that college gives them. Thereby, giving the students one more burden to carry and cope with. Also, this will detract the government's aim to improve the work-life balance of Singaporeans. Thus, instead of having quality family bonding during their free time, they will be spending their time doing their part-time job. This may put a strain on their family relations, creating unhappiness in their household. Therefore, it is not important for college students to have a part time job due to the repercussions the society will have. Lastly, though having a part-time job will enhance the college student's resume and will develop their character and maturity, the main job of the college student is to study. With the cost of college education high, their education should be their priority over a part-time job. If the individual is able to do well academically, then he may choose to enrich their resume and college experience with a part-time job. This will beef up their employer prospects in the future. However, not having a part-time job in college will not hinder him from getting a job in the future. With a good attitude and the capability to learn and be taught, he can easily find a job in the future. Therefore, it's not important to have a part-time job in college. ",SIN
"In this globalization era, every people in this world try to be better than the others. They do many things to become the best, especially in a job. Now, many companies are looking for the worker who doesn't only smart but they had to have a lot of experiences. So, I think part time job for students are so important. With part time job, the students can practice what they have learned in their class. For example, for the English education students, they can be a part timer in English courses. With become a teacher, so they can practice the knowledge and they know how to become a good teacher because sometimes the theory that we got is different or difficult to do in the real world. They also are trained to handle the problems if they ever had a part time job. They have known what they should do if they have a problem in their job. If they become a part timer in the financial division, they will know how to manage the money and make the financial book. The students also can learn how to manage their time because they have to study in university and work too. They should make the priority which they have to do. They have to finish what they choose in the right time and take a responsibility too about their choices. So, part time job is important for the students. After graduation, they will be looking for a job. With experience in part time job and the knowledge that they got, they will be ready to work and compete with the others. They will get the job and become success.",IDN
"As we all know, smoking is a bad habit, it affects all people who don't smoke, so I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some argues that smoking has several benefits, such as help the body and mind relax, help to concentrate on study or work, and some even say that smoking is legal so people should respect the rights of smokers. However, those smokers always ignore the fact that the nasty smell of smoke and the toxic substances released from cigarettes is harmful to others no matter how smokers argue, people around smokers are forced to breathe in second-hand smoke, it shows how selfish are those smokers. Reports from different medical research already found that those smoke and toxic substances may cause cancer, including lung cancer. No matter do smokers mind the potential danger of having cancer, they should not ignore the right of others of avoiding those substances. Smoking in kitchen can be even more dangerous. When people smoke, ashes may drop onto food being prepared and it is very harmful to our health. Secondly, without enough care, lighted cigarettes may causes fire in kitchen, which is a serious threat to customers in the restaurant. So I again agree and suggest that smoking should be banned in restaurant because of health issue it may cause.",HKG
"From my point of view, I couldn't agree with forbidding smoking in public place any more for the following reasons. Above all, it is not only the smoker's health but also all the health of people around him that someone smokes in public will make a bad effect on. Take me for an example. Though my father never smokes, I still often cough out of the bad air made by smoking. Undoubtedly, there's something to do with smoking in public place. In other words, the success of the volunteers appealing us not to smoke is easily in vain because our health is still affected by smoke. What's more, if smoking is forbidden in public place, there will be a great improvement in our environments. It is obvious that the abandoned cigarrit will become rubbish. More importantly, many people are not aware that they should throw them into dustbins. No wonder there are ciggrats in the streets here and there. Only by forbidding smoking in public place can we solve the problem. Most importantly, in this way, we can decrease the chance that children are addicted to smoke. There is no doubt that children are will to do what the grown-ups do. If they see a lot of adults smoking in the public place, they are easily to follow them. Even though they discover that smoking is harmful, they can hardly get rid of it. In a word, I hold the view that smoking in public place should be forbidden.",CHN
Part time job is necessary for college students. Now a days it is very important for a college student to do part time job to make his or her and his or her family life easy. Job make a students responsible and dependent. It increase their self esteem also ;as we know now a days it is difficult for parents to afford education expenditures college student is a big boy or girl so he can do a job he can afford his or her expenditures. as compare to other countries in Pakistan the job rate of college students is low. In foreign countries students do part time job and their lives easy. A good student manage their study and job both together. It is wrong to focus only job. Balance should be there. If the student do job and not the study he will fail. So he should be careful. By doing job in college make a student responsible and their also effect on the progress of the country.

" Some people think there are more advantages for colleges students to take part-time jobs than disadvantages, others don't think so. What's your view on this? And tell why. A serious problem has arisen in recent several years that more and more college students abandon study because of their taking part-time jobs, so quite a few people are opposed to part-time jobs. However, taking part-time jobs has at least three benefits for college students in my eyes. First, students can promote their study through part-time jobs. For instance, If a law student finds a part-time job in a law firm, his practice will enable him to better understand what he's learned from books. What's more, the part-time job can offer him opportunities to go beyond what he's been taught in class, and he'll learn something that doesn't exist in books but in practice. Second, students can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job-hunting. Actually, part-time jobs act as warm-up exercises for students to take full-time jobs after they graduate, and help them prepare for their future careers. In addition, as fresh blood in the society, graduated students are often unwelcome in job-hunting markets for lack of practical work experiences. It's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Last but not the least, part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families. It's a fact that students break the balance between their jobs and studies, especially when they fall into conflict with each other. But I think students should spend their spare time taking part-time jobs. Only following this principle can they benefit from their part.",CHN
"In this day and age, there are many college students who take up part-time jobs for their own various reasons. For some, it serves as an extra source of income, while others could be supporting themselves. Nonetheless, is it really that important for college students to have a part-time job? I believe that it is good for students to take up part-time jobs, however, having a part-time job as a student means that one would have less time and energy to channel towards school and schoolwork. Students would have to manage their time well and if they do not succeed in doing so, chances are that their studies will probably suffer at the expense of the part-time job. When their studies start suffering, the importance level of the part-time job decreases. I feel that their energy should be focused on doing well in school, and if there is no need for the student to support his or herself, it is definitely not important for them to have a part-time job. However, it is also good for college students to take up part-time jobs, because it teaches them to be a little bit more independent and responsible. When they have part-time jobs, they have to balance their time for work and school. This will teach them to maximize their time, and in addition, they will also earn a little bit of financial independence so they do not have to rely on their parents all the time. Overall, I feel that it is good if students can take up part-time jobs, but it is not of such importance that it becomes a necessity. Sure, it teaches one to manage their time better and provides a little more spending money, but it is definitely not important unless one needs the money to survive. (300 words) ",SIN
"There were numerous benefits for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, college students will be able to gain an extra source of income. This will help them financially. If the student came from a poor family background, this income will help to reduce the burden on the family. Thus this will enable them to become more independent financially. They will have a certain budget that they have to spend within. Thus they will have a clearer idea on how to handle money. Secondly, through the job experience, they will understand the hard work that has to be put in to earn the income. They will then be able to better appreciate what their family has provided them since young. Furthermore, this job experience will help to shape their character. They will be able to gain a different exposure to life; hard work reaps result. Lastly, having a part-time job will enable them to enlarge their social circle.

This will enable them to improve on their communication skills which will prove vital when they go out to work in the future. ",SIN
"I disagree with the opinion. It is sure that smoke bothers those who don't like it, but you should not only support abstainers from tobacco but also stand by smokers. I think that all the restaurants should have two areas; one is the smoking area and the other is the no smoking area. Smoking and the smoke are thought to be harmful to you. And also actually the smoke of others is smoky and smelly to you if you aren't smoker. So you may say that if you are allowed to smoke in the restaurants, they have many demerits and don't have any merits. I don't, however, think so. If the restaurants completely ban smoking, they would get abstainers' satisfaction, but wouldn't get smokers' satisfaction and some of them would decide not to go to the restaurants. As a result, the restaurants would share only abstainers. In short, the pie would get small. To avoid such tragedy, the restaurants should allow smokers to smoke. If, however, they do so, abstainers would get angry instead of smokers. Then, what do the restaurants should do to gratify both of them? I have an opinion. The restaurant should make the smoker sit another to the abstainer on the area. It only has to prevent the originated smoke from reaching the no smoking seat from the smoking seat. If the group that consists of the smoker and the abstainer comes to the restaurant, they only have to decide on which seat they sit for the restaurant. Therefore, I am opposite to the opinion, and I think that the restaurant should have the smoking seat and the no smoking seat.",JPN
"I'm of the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think so because I have ??? reasons. The first reason is that smoking does harm to not only smoking person but also the people around him. He is free, to be sure, to do something he wants to do. But, he doesn't have a right that he does harm to other people. Moreover, they have a right that they are healthy to live a long time. Furthermore, smoking does harm to them worse than him. I think that this action is very selfish. The second reason is that smoking has a bad influence on smoking person's health and the cigarettes are too expensive. Moreover, the cigarette's price keeps on increasing because the government will decide to add to cigarette's tax. The smoking persons pay a lot of money and are done harm to by the cigarettes. I don't think that is a very good idea. The third reason is that the most people around the smoking person feel unpleasant. If many people feel unpleasant when they are walking, they feel so when they are eating. People shouldn't do something other people feel so as possible as they could. Therefore Japanese's government should ban from smoking in restaurants.",JPN
"Most university students do part time job because they want to earn more money for them to afford entertainments, buying fashionable clothes, hanging around with their newly met friends in the university. Most of the people may think that those students only focus on earning money, expanding their social scope rather than their study in the university. Whether it is important for a university student to get a part time job depends on what he or she wan to get from it. University students are already adults.

For me, it is important for me because I would like to earn more working experience during the university life so as to well prepare myself for adapting the society after I have graduated for the university.

"In Korea, while most students attend schools without a job, some students have part-time jobs. With the money, they do what they want, such as buying clothes. It is widely accepted that students should focus on their study, not a job. However, having a job has a positive influence on students First, students, at workplace, can learn what they cannot do in schools. In Korea, professors usually teach students only academic subjects, such as literature and physics. Even though these subjects are important in living a life, there are other important things, leadership or followership. In fact, it is difficult for students to apply academic subjects to social lives since these subjects are too theoretical. Therefore, after graduation, students who have not worked will have difficulty in dealing with their social tasks at their workplace unlike the ones who have had a job. Second, students can do various things with their money that they have earned from their jobs. Students with a job will make more money than their monthly allowance that they get from their parents. Parents do not give much money to their sons and daughters. Even if they give much money to them, students feel the lack of money. This is because they want to make up well and meet their lovers as well as go to trip with friends. Therefore, working at a part-time job, students can do what they really want with the money.

There are two benefits is that reducing expenditure of their family, and increase work's experience. First, a part time job can reduce expenditure of a family because the students will have money for their living cost, so they do not have to ask for parent's money. and also can help parents out by pay some part of university fees. Moreover, parents can save money for other expenditures of a family, too. Second, a part time job also increases work's experience. They will learn how to make self-discipline because in a future these students will have to go working for a company or anywhere, so this is a good way to train their behave to be an adult. As you see I have mentioned above, a part-time job could reduce social problems because the student who get a part-time job will have responsibility on their duty, and they will not have much time for hang out around at night with their friends as much as they could.

And it can also relief the pressure of parents. For another, through part-time job we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will good for us to prepare our future job. As the competition is fiercer in the social life, the more experience you have, the more chance you will have. However, the others are against the idea, they hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on study. It will spend much of our time and energy to do the part-time job. Because as part-time worker, our life and property security is not well protected by the law. For my own perspective, as we enter the university we have more free time, it is important for you to choose how to use of them. We should make the most of time and be the master of it.

In the part time job, students cannot only learn a lot of things which can't in class, but also see a more colorful world. So they get real information about the society from doing part-time job. Fourthly, because most part time job paid, this salary can be used as the tuition cost of living. In other words, having a part time job also can reduce the financial burden of parents. On the other hand, it also can improve college students' self-awareness. Finally, college students have plenty of spare time, they should do something meaningful. In the end, I have to say, college students must arrange their own time reasonably if they decide to do part time job. Don't affect their normal study. That's all.",CHN
"Whether smoking should be completely banned at restaurants has certainly risen a controversy. Recently in Taiwan, our legislative Yuan has passed a law in order to ban smoking at restaurants and other public-open places. I personally support the law with my whole heart and strongly believe that smoking should be banned. In numerous medical reports, many evidence suggested that not only cigarette addicts but also people that breathe in the polluted air may die from respiration system related cancers. To be specific, people may be forced to die in an unpleasant way just because other's bad habit. I think anyone with consciousness will not allow this to happen. Furthermore, with fumes filling the atmosphere of a restaurant, harmful particles can possibly land on our dishes and travel all the way through our digestive systems. Some people might cough or sneeze when inhaling the fumes and thus spreading viruses or bacterium into the air. People go to restaurants to enjoy the great food and happy time, not to tolerate other's selfishness and get sick. Maybe those who hold different perspectives may not agree with my statement. However, I think for the sake of everyone's health, smoking should be banned not only at restaurants but every inches of land.",TWN
"I think it is important more for college students to have a part-time job because if I finish study. I will have experience for career and meet many people. I will have money for reserve to spend everything when I have not money. It makes me grow up and many responsibility. I think my parents are proud of myself that I can do many things by myself moreover it gives me confident when I find work. Don't shy to presentation to people when I am work. It makes me ask questions that ""Have you ever worked when you studied in college?"" It makes me spend time to be useful and do everything by myself. It makes me proud. But sometimes I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job because it might make me do not have time for to do homework. Review exercises or read books. And it might me sleep less. Don't understand when teacher teach me or sleepy in classes. And it might me send homework not on time. It might makes me tired and don't have time to do activities at University. So I think a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages.",THA
"The opinions of smoking area are still hot potato. When we go to any restaurants and cafes, we can see smoking area for non-smokers. Why they make a smoking area? I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and cafes in the country. First, if people smoke cigarette in restaurant, non-smoker feel unpleasant. When I went to pub to talk with my friends, some people smoke straight at next table so cigarette smoke was flew to our table. We smelled with own nose about cigarette smoke and everyone felt unpleasant. Also, we wanted to claim to smoker at next table people but we could do this. I think that non-smoker's rights are more important than smoker. Above all things, non-smoker's rights can be respected to protect the health of non-smoker. I heard that second-hand smoking is more dangerous than smoking directly. Second-hand smoking is a big health hazard. Also, being around secondhand smoke increases your risk of emphysema. Especially, children are easily vulnerable to secondhand smoke unconsciously. Maybe, smokers argue own rights of smoking clearly. But if smokers know that non-smokers feel unpleasant and are exacerbated by them, they can't smoke in front of non-smokers anymore. I hope that no one smoke in the world will be coming soon.",KOR

I also told my friend who wants to become a kindergarten teacher and have the same hobby. So we can use our free time with work to become a kindergarten teacher and could get enough salary.",IDN
"I agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to hospital statistics, smoking is bad for children, elderly and adults. Smoking can harm our health, especially lung. If you smoke a lot, you can cough a lot. On the other hands, buying cigarettes is very expensive, including health tax. If you could quit smoking, you can save a lot of money. In television the ad of banned smoking is popular. Most celebrities show in TV to tell everybody danger of smoking. For me, I hate that person who can smoke and be addicted. And I also hate the smell of smoking. Because my sister is a nurse, I learn a lot from her. She has taught me about danger of smoking. Smoking is very risky and harmful. I think nobody can smoke in public, especially restaurants. That behavior is banned strictly. Everyone should respect others. In public we should speak quietly and not smoke. I think government should make a strict rule. Restaurants can follow the rule. If smokers are at restaurant, they will get a fine. For everyone health, banned smoking in public is very important. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",TWN
"I agree with the idea that it is important for colleague student to have a part-time job. After we graduate the university, we will have to work for company. So while we are still universal students, we had better have part-time jobs and experience many important things that we aren't able to experience only by working. And by trying a lot of kind of works, we will able to have keys for finding what kind of works we want to have after we graduate the university. Now I work for a cram school and teach students who will take entrance exams. I knew that it is difficult to explain to people even things I can understand and that it is important to see the problems in the point of view of people who don't know the ways to solve the problems. And I am able to get accustomed to talk in public and learn the manner that is necessary for us to live among human relationships. I thought it is important not only to teach subjects for entrance exams but also support with students' minds that fight against nervous feeling before the exam. While we are universal student, we think we have a lot of time but actually we can't have as enough time as we think. So we had better do things that we can't do only now. Let's play a lot, study and work a lot by having part-time jobs, to train our minds for leading meaningful life in the future.",JPN
"I agree with the idea. It is because that working at part time job is very good chance to learn a lot of things. For example how to communicate with people at official situation and how hard to get money is. Although there are many people who disagree with it because working at cram school or home teacher is too high wage for college or university student, I don't think so. There are two reasons. At first, working at these jobs will be very good and rare chances to learn how to teach or tell other people what they want to teach or tell. Next, I think that too high wage is not totally wage but hourly wage. Generally speaking, because college or university student have to attend a lot of class, they don't have much time for part time job. And they need so much money to play with their friends or to buy clothes. Especially, students who live alone have to get a lot of money to pay fee for house, energy, gas, and so on. Even though they do high hourly wage jobs, their totally wage will fit their life style. College or university students are likely to have more time when they are free for classes than high school students. They shouldn't use the time to do nothing or sleep but also should use it very effectively. It usually means to do part time job or to study. So they should study in college or university and do part time job out of there.",JPN
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons about it. First I do not like tobacco's smell. I always see the people that smoke around Turumai Park and Nagoya university hospital. I think that Tobacco's smell is very bad. When I go though their people, I get bad feeling. So when I go though their people, I always stop breathing during going though them. Second smoking is dangerous for people that are around a smoking man. Smoking affects bad for a smoking man. But, smoking affects a smoking man more than a man that are around a smoking man. Nicotine which is contained of tobaccos has reliance. And tobacco contains of a lot of toxic substance. So when we breathe where there are tobaccos, we tend to get diseases more than we live in nothing of tobacco. So I think that tobacco is dangerous drug. Tobacco is nothing of good effect to us. So I want to ban smoking not only at all the restaurants in the country, bad also all over Japan. That is why I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",JPN
"Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. I agree if all restaurant should be completely banned for smoking. A restaurant is a place for having meals and should not be polluted by the smoke of cigarettes. Besides it if the restaurant not application for example in the pub discotheque it impossible for application this rule so in the conclusion it better the pub give smoking area in this area so not missing human right for active smoking and not give suffer a loss for passive smoking because the effect for passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking. However individuals who smoke should realize that smoking in public places can be a source of great inconvenience to people who are around. Hence it is imperative that they should refrain from smoking in places where others are present. It is the only way to deal with passive smoking in an effective manner. Parents who smoke at home should be aware of the consequences that their action can have on their children, and so should not smoke in front of them.",IDN

You will breathe bad air. In the same way, it will have bad effects on the people around you in the public places. From a professional standpoint, smoking in the public places makes everyday bad. On the other hand, it does harm to the atmosphere, and it will affect the environment, too. We all know that there are many people in the public places, so it is hard to make the air clean.

"One reason is because smoking damages our health. Smoking increase the risk of lung cancer and is risk factor for others disease such as high blood pressure, angina and atherosclerosis. The damage can be even higher when the other person inhales the smoke that burn form the cigarette. This can happen in a restaurant if smoking is not banned because diner are often sitted close together. Another reason is because smoking can irritate the other person appetiate. Imagine that if a person next to your table is smoking while you are having your dinner in the restaurant, you would definitely feel uncomfortable as you be worried whether the dust from the smoke would goes to your food. However, some may think smoking should not be banned. One opposing reason is because they felt that people should have the freedom to choose what they want to do even in the restaurant. It is a person habit to smoke before and after eating the dinner. The restaurant should not restrict it. However, this reason is not valid as although the person should have freedom to choose what they want to do but they should not forgotten that they are cause others people discomfort though their action. This is what we should not do in a civilised country. ",SIN

They believe study is second to none in importance for college students, and part time job is a waste of time because it takes a lot of our limited time and energy.

"I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Because restaurant is a place which has function to eat and drink for visitor. Restaurant is not correct place to smoking. Some people maybe do smoking after they finish their eat, but how about other people? Are they like to do it? I think they feel uncomfortable about that situation. If that situation happened, government must look for solution about this problem. Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. It is solution for people who doesn't like smoking. As we know, the visitor who come in restaurants is from any age. From young until old people can be visitor at that restaurant. Smoker must know about that. They can make dirty condition at that restaurant. So, restaurant must give a special place for that smoker, if that smoker want smoking. It is better solution for smoker and the visitor who doesn't like smoking at that restaurant. If that smoker obey that regulation, restaurant can give a punishment. Maybe that smoker clean the plate and glass from visitor, or clean the restaurant floor.

"Nowadays, there are more and more teenagers having their part time jobs in vacation like summer and winter vacation. You can choose what you want to do like working in a restaurant or being a tutor. In my opinions, part time job is an interesting and challenging work because you will learn a lot in the process of working. Learning is an important part during the work. You will learn the things that you never learn before. For example, if you being a waiter you will have to learn how to serve people and clean up tables. As for being a tutor, you must own your own professional knowledge like master in English or math, and you have the duty to teach your students well to make sure he/she understands what you're teaching.

"I think part time job is important for adult and university student. Part time job give many benefits for people or for students. If we have part time job, we can learn about how difficult to get money. So, we can appreciate our effort to get money and don't waste much money for something that not important or useless. For example, like buy some new clothes, new accessories, new bags, go to salon and so on. Women like to buy things like that, although not necessary, but if we already feel how precious we are seeking our own money, then we will save the money for something more is needed or useful, such as college tuition or future saving. In addition, not only get money, but also life experiences that might be useful someday. Another benefit of working part time is that we can become independent students. Students who not only beg for money from their parents. So that, we will get used to attempt our own money and not dependent on our parents because in the end, we will have our own family. There will be a benefit that is felt by our parents. They will be proud and appreciate our action, provided that part-time job that we take is not bad for such jobs that endanger our lives, moral damage, interfere with our study, interfering with other people, too risky, and the jobs that are not feasible or unhealthy.

It is better to find a part-time job during this time. Secondly, considering we need to gain social experiences before graduation and college life can't offer us many chances, we can do a part-time job to improve our social abilities. Thirdly, we can earn some money to reduce our parents' burden. Though most of parents ask us not to worry about the expenses in college, as a college student, we are old enough to do so and we are responsible to support ourselves even our parents.

"Now a days part time job is very necessary for the college students. Becomes need of the students of colleges and universities. There are factors behind this and many causes of this issue. First cause of this is that the inflation becomes very high every in our country It is very difficult for an ordinary man with short income to give education to his children. In this age it is very hard to manage the expenses of house. Second reason of this is that the dues and expenses of education are also increasing day by day. And as consequence students of the colleges are compelled to do part time jobs that they be able to bear their expenses and reduce the burden of their parents. One reason of this is that the student of this age is think more independently and he want to do something for himself. He can go through his study properly when he do work in his leisure time. Students from middle standard families had to suffer the hurdles of money in their education then it becomes need for the students. The financial pressure is very serious one. A few parents take the position that the boy should earn his way through college for the good of his soul. Nevertheless, many boys are cast entirely on their own resources for their college expenses.

"I agree that college students should have a part-time job because the expenses of college or higher education have grown at an alarming rate over the past few years. This has compelled many college students to look for the part time jobs, which involve working for a few hours and attending college lectures once the work gets over. Though there are some negative aspects of part time jobs for college students like over exertions and some sort of tensions, these jobs provide the students with the much needed experience which comes handy while studying courses like management, engineering and accounts. Given below are some exciting part time entry level jobs for college students. A part-time job can help you pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books, gas, and clothes. Since you will eventually have to pay off any school-related loans that you take out, it is best to take out as little as possible. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future.

"Smoking is somewhat very controversial issue in the modern society.

It shoulder be perfectly a decision that people make by themselves whiter they smoke or not. However, since indirect smoking is known as very harmful to people and there are people who cannot even handle the specific smell of cigarette and tobacco, the smokers should aware these facts and respect these non-smokers. Shortly, as well as non-smokers respect them and let them smoke wherever and whenever, the smokers also must respect the non-smokers, because even though smoking is allowed by the law, their choice to harm their body can also harm other people who do not choose to harm themselves.

"Smoking is something very dangerous for human beings. It causes many problems. Especially it causes lungs problems and chest cancer. The pulmonary system of smokers is defected and largely and ultimately it brings a smoker to the domain of death. So the questions is why people are addicted to this bad and vicious habit. Smoking is some thing which generally people start as a fashion. For example if a person is inspired by some VIP, actor or some political leader, who is smoker, he will definitely adopt his habits as will start smoking. In the beginning this would be just a habit. But after that it would become his need and he would be unable to live without it. He will be addicted to other smoking and dangerous problems. The ultimate result would be dangerous and it will cost him money and lost of physical and moral life. So smoking is some thing very dangerous thing.

"I think that part-time job is important for college students, and for the following reason. First, by working with many other people, we can acquaint ourselves with them. Making many friends is very important in our lives. Second, we experience new environment that we have not known, so we can learn many important things. For example a social rules such as a greeting, responsibility, and attitude. They are essential for college students to go out into the public society. But it is very difficult to learn social rules. We may mistake many time at part-time job. We may be got angry. Through these bitter experiences, we surely become adult. So I think we need some mistakes at the part-time job. In public society, it is too late for us to make a mistake. Part-time job is first step to go into the society. Third, we can earn money on our own. I think most of college students work because of this third reason not first or second reason. College students have much free time. Using their time for them is efficient. For these reasons, I think part-time job is necessary, so I agree with that college students do part-time job.",JPN
"Smoking in public areas is a huge debated issue in Singapore In my point of view, it is necessary to ban smoking in some areas, but concession should be allowed for some highlighted cases. Recently, the government has legislated against public smoking in certain areas to alleviate the inconveniences brought to passive smokers who are unwilling recipients of the tobacco. While non-smokers and environmentalists cheer to this law, some stakeholders in the society are dismayed by it. For example, business owners lament over the smoker-customers who are less willing to spend and dine at their establishments due to this restriction. To this end, we have to acknowledge that smoking is a social currency to some in the society, typically in bars and social hangouts characterized by business dealings and social exchanges. Offering a cigarette or a lighter to light up is known as a kind gesture to mark the start of a friendship or a reciprocal relationship. Social smoking is more tolerated than its pathological counterpart, and thus I would advocate for smoking to be allowed in certain areas. A complete ban on public smoking might have positive externalities on the public health and environment at large, but businesses and social dealings will have to be altered accordingly, to which, will lead to many dismal responses from the public.

"Smoking the customers away In restaurants, not only do you consider the food that will be served; the environment too is key. When you enter a restaurant, you are not only excited to eat, but you also look forward to relaxing while doing so. Unfortunately, the presence of smoking in a restaurant would ruin the mood. Forget about the idea of smoking and non-smoking areas; not all restaurants have these areas. Smoking should be banned from restaurants period. There are areas for the sole purpose of eating. Likewise, smoking-only areas have their place too. We can't overlap their roles; it wouldn't be fair for both sides. They were meant to be separated for a reason; so that both parties could enjoy their said products. You wouldn't want a family entering a restaurant for the purpose of bonding and satisfaction to be bothered by the discomfort of the smoke coming from a cigarette, one that can cause health problems later on. And in the same way, a smoker wouldn't want to have to deal with people complaining about his business; he wants to smoke in peace. Smoking in restaurants is actually a drawback for potential customers. If they pass by a restaurant and see smokers in front, the restaurant wouldn't be as enticing as it should be. Also, restaurants wouldn't be able to accommodate as much customers as they could if there are smoking areas. If non-smokers want to eat in a full restaurant but the only available spot is in the smoking area, wouldn't that be unfair for them? At the end of the day, smoking and restaurants can't be put together. One is meant for nutrition while the other is a detriment to one's health.

The rule is that smokers are not allowed to smoke in public areas anymore, such as offices, train stations and restaurants. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Not only banned for health reason but also give respect to un-smokers. Not everyone can stand that kind of smell. But restaurants can still have smoking room or area for smoker to enjoy both their habits and food. Other public areas also can have the same design for smokers. People in 21st centaury become more polite to other persons and respect each other. That remote the country to improve.",TWN
"Recently, there are more and more people smoking in Hong Kong, though smoking has been proved as an unhealthy habit. As a result, whether to ban smoking at all restaurants has become a controversial issue. In my opinion, although whether to smoke is one's right, non-smokers who are sitting in the same restaurant should by no means be forced to inhale any of the smoke. Smoking should immediately be banned at all restaurants in our city. As we all know, smoking leads to severe illness like lung cancer and heart disease. And, when one smokes, the air around must inevitably be contaminated with all these harmful smoke. Therefore, the customers nearby have to smoke with the smokers. Let's imagine, if we take 3 meals everyday at restaurants and spend 30 minutes for each, how much smoke will we breathe in and how will our health be affected? The only result is our health deteriorates. What is more, the deterioration of our health will lead to heavy workload to the public hospitals, and lead to a higher death rate. Therefore, the public's health should under no circumstances be sacrificed for the selfish behavior of the smokers. That is, smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants.",HKG

Smoking is the bad thing because the people who smoke can not live happily and suddenly they die. I think that smoking is a bad habit because smoking destroys the homes of people and also danger for the life of every man.",PAK
"Having a part-time job in college is absolutely an excellent idea for the majority of college students. Some students have very difficult majors which will require them to be more committed with their time in their focus but many others including myself can easily arrange our time to balance both the requirements of a part-time job and the requirements of attending school. For example, I work as a cashier at the campus convenience store, and the best part of this job is that when there are no customers we can study as much as we want to. In addition, I have made many new friends by working here at the convenience store. Many people say that students already have a job: their job is to go to school and get good grades. But I also think that there are some things that simply cannot be learned purely by studying in a classroom environment. For example, no matter how much studying you do you can never learn how hard it is to make money and once you have job you can learn this. What's more, having a part-time job looks great on your resume and can help you to find another part time job if you should need to do so.",ENS
"I agree with this statement. This is because college students need to know what working is like. First of all, I talk about my example. When I was the first grade at university, I didn't have a part-time job. But now, I am the second grade and have a part-time job, because I want to learn what working is like before I graduate from university. At first I was worried and tired, but now I am used to my job. And I can know how difficult communicating with many people is and know making money is not easy, and so on. I cannot learn those things from a lecture in university. Then, I explain why you have to know how working is while you are college student. Some people say that college students should not have a part-time job because they work too hard to study in a lecture. Of course, studying is very important. However, will you really need only an academic skill in the future? You'll work with many people such as co-workers, bosses or customers. And you have to communicate with them. Even if you sufficiently have an academic skill, you can't work alone. Recently, people who don't have a job have been increasing. Some people don't work though they graduate from a college. After they graduate from their college, they have a job. But, they bother about human relations and resign their job. Therefore, you should be used to communicating with many people while you are college student. In university, you mainly talk to your friend. But, if you have a part-time job, you have to contact with many people. You can learn from a part-time job how to communicate with many people. So to conclude, college students need to have a part-time job.",JPN
"Nowadays, having a part-time job has been a trend among college or university students. Some consider that it is important for college student to have part-time jobs; while others hold the opposite attitude towards it. In my opinion, I think it is crucial for college students to get a part-time job, and I have several reasons why. To begin with, by doing the work assigned by the boss, students can gain experiences from their part-times. During work time, a student may face a lot of difficulties such as troublesome customers, lazy and irresponsible colleagues, mean and strict supervisors, to name but a few that they might not confront at schools or homes. From dealing with these difficulties, a student can acquire valuable skills on interacting with people properly, finding the best solution to solve a problem, the bright or dark side of human, and among others which later on will definitely be useful when they enter society. In addition to gaining experiences, students can also earn some money in order to help their parents pay their tuition. What's more, there might be extra money for students to spend meanwhile they don't have to ask their parents for more money. Doing a part-time job is certainly something that a student will benefit from. Of course, there are drawbacks for college students to do part-time jobs such as declining grades or lack of concentration on courses. However, I believe that a student is mature enough to determine what one's priority is and enjoy both his or her college life as well as part-time job!",TWN
"Freedom is a basic right of the individual in any civilized society. That is why I implore you to allow smoking in any and all restaurants. If they were to take away our first right after birth, to breath, then what next? Already the society is too controlled. We cannot even talk on our cell phones on the train! I find this very strange as people are talking all around me. Why can't I speak with my friend miles away? We must wear seatbelts. I know this is for our own safety. And yet, how much control does the society need to place on its citizens before it stops making rules to protect us? Be in bed by 10 pm. Never walk around with chopsticks in your mouth. Cut your lawn back so that nobody strips over it And on and on. there is no end and we are headed towards a communist system. As you can see if is a question of freedom. Just as patrons have the choice to eat out or not. Also, the restaurant owner has the freedom to install fans with filters. If you cannot handle the noise and smoke then maybe you have the freedom to stay home.",ENS
"It shouldn't just be banned in restaurants, Japan and every country in the world should ban smoking everywhere forever. I can't understand what people or governments must be thinking sometimes because cigarettes contain poison and when the are lit up, the fumes contain poison which is just being freely released into the air that I and everybody else has to breathe. There was a big court case in Canada a few years ago about a factory that was releasing poisonous gas into the air through one of their chimney stacks. It took three years and a lot of money before the courts decided to shut them down. Three years during which time, they were still doing the same thing, releasing toxins into the air. Smokers can do it and get away with it freely and easily and yet, what's the difference? It is all poison and it is killing us and those we love every year with nothing really being done about it except to introduce a few bans here and there. What a waste of time that is because if they cannot light up in a restaurant or library, then they just go outside and do it anyway. If governments and Japan too, really care about the environment and the people, then prohibit its use everywhere, just like drugs and let the smokers go through the pain of kicking their habits. Might help to teach them a lesson.",ENS
"I think smoking should completely ban at all restaurant. First of all, smoking is harmful to the health of the smoker and other people. In the restaurant, it usually a closed area, although nowadays, many restaurant have smoking area, it still have the effect to those non-smoker since the smoke can diffuse to the non-smoking area. Completely ban at all restaurant means there are lesser place for the smoker to smoke, may be it is a good chance for them not to smoke anymore. Second-hand smoke is a problem that being discussed for a long time, smoking not only harms to smoker's health, but also the others. People who inhale the second-hand smoke also cause the serious problem. On the street, this may not causes the serious problem since the area is so large so that the amount inhaled may not be so much. But, in the restaurant, since it usually a closed area, the smoke may trap in the area and people have a larger chance inhale the second-hand smoke, especially those do not have a good air-circulating system. Therefore, I think smoking should completely ban at all restaurant since the smoke, or smoking affect the health of many people.",HKG
"I think smoking should be prohibited in all public places. It is a unhealthy habit, which should be immediately banned. Smoking should only be allowed on personal property and land. There have been numerous reports, linking cigarette smoking to heart disease; lung disease; cancers of the lung, mouth, and other tissues; and other ailments. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemical substances, many of which have been linked to the development of diseases. Chemical substances occur in cigarette smoke as gases or as particals. Many places in which smoking should be banned are in pubs, clubs and working places. Pubs are very important places for people in communities, especially small communities. It is a place for people to socialize and be entertained. In some communities the pub is the town meeting place for the locals. There are no non-smoking pubs and very few non-smoking front bars. Although the eating areas in pubs are non-smoking sometimes there is so much smoke it drifts everywhere. Smoking in pubs is a hazard to non-smokers and the workers. It is unhealthy and not fair on the people that don't smoke and want to have a good time. These days smoking is a popular craze in pubs but should be quickly stopped. Clubs are another place you would avoid if you felt strongly about smoke. Cigarette's contain health-damaging particles and are a health hazard to many.. Smoking is the leading cause of life-threatening diseases and should be done away from public places. More young people go to clubs and it is a bad habit for them to be breathing in smoke. One of the most dangerous things is passive smoking and in clubs this is what non-smokers are doing.",PHL
"I agree the statement. That is, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, there are some reasons. First, some of them must earn money as the cost of living themselves. In my case, money for rent is given by my parents' home. But, I must pay almost of the cost of eating by myself. The person whose environment is like me is being everywhere. Second, if they have enough of money, they would be able to buy a lot of things. For example, clothes, books, comics, and so on. We can buy whatever you want. Third, to communicate with other people, enough of money is precious. I sometimes go to a movie theater to see a movie with my friends. Money needs for it. Of course, money is not always needed to communicate with others. But, most of the chance, money is precious. Finally, to work somewhere is good experience. Not only college students but also high school students can work. But, for high school students, it is much more important to study than to work. And, some of college students will get a job after graduation. In that case, the experience of working is important. That's why that I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"It is interesting that now, after so many years of ignoring it, parents are urging their children to take part-time jobs. Although many might consider it unnecessary as they come from well-off families, having a part-time job not only gives the child more money, it also teaches very important values which can help the child later on in life. First, it teaches the child independence. Since the child no longer has to depend on his parents giving him his allowance for his daily sustenance, he now has a sense of independence which will help him later on in life. This is a very crucial trait to teach to a child. Secondly, it teaches the child to be responsible. When one has a job, he is trusted to complete the tasks assigned to him. And unlike school where non-compliance simply results in a verbal reprimand, the child is exposed to a world with real consequences. As a result, the child learns accountability and responsibility. Finally, a part-time job would develop a child's self-confidence â€“he now earns money and can buy what he wants without having to beg his parents. This gives the child a sense of achievement which, in turn, improves a child's self-confidence. This helps him later on in life as he faces various challenges. So, one can see that a part-time job has numerous benefits in bringing up a child-it is not only an added source of income. This is why parents must encourage their children to take up part-time jobs. a",PHL

"There are two reasons to why smoking should be banned in restaurants. The first reason would be because of health purposes. A lot of people have already died suffering from diseases caused by the smoke. And it is not a quick, funny death. The death will be a slow, painful one - torturing one's mind and soul. So many organ dysfunctions can be the result from smoking cigarettes, pot, and also weed. Pancreas, liver, lungs, kidneys and some other body parts can all be shut down after consistently smoking for some time. Smoking in restaurants should be banned because the air inside the restaurant is tightly packed. When smokers light up their cigars, the smoke will tend to spread inside the room, therefore, polluting the small, full of foods area. I do believe the smokers tend to think they are cool when they are smoking, light up a match, put it on the smoke and blow the smoke to someone's face ain't cool to me though. It's a form of disrespect. Some are smoking usually for the sake of being relaxed. They will find living difficult old years of age if one is a heavy smoker even if it is during his/her young years. Moreover, there are people who will suffer more than the smoker itself. These people are the ones who inhale the smoke after the smoker exhales it. We call them the second hand smokers. You see, there is no benefit when smoking cigarettes. To prevent these kinds of tragic incidents, government should ban the production and supply of cigarettes, pot, weed and all other kinds of guilty pleasures in their local civilization. They should also prevent importing these.",PHL
"Stop and listen to a conversation in the bus or in the supermarket and time and time again you will hear about part-time job. It is important to have it or not important for college students. Nowadays you can see that some college students have a free time and don't have money to use. That is the one reason that they take a part time job for their own money to use. A part-time job have been known that can make college students have money and experience for get real work at their major have study. It's important that they can learn work before they graduated from university. And some companies want college students that have experience before to work with them that will make a college student wanted a part-time job.

Because I saw some college students use money for find cruise such as some friends of mine. They use money to drink alcohol and go to pub or bar when their money gone out they might borrow money or go part-time job. That is bad I think they could use money for education or daily life.

" Speaking of the topic whether college students should take part time job, opinions are often divided. Some people believe that students should focus on their study, while others feel that taking a part time job is necessary. As far as I am concerned, I prefer the latter. I can raise examples to support my viewpoint. To begin with, taking a part time job enables us to get a main idea of the society. We will leave our schools and walk into the society sooner or later. By that time, what we need is not only the knowledge, but also the skills and manners. Undoubtedly, the experience of doing a part time job will help us be familiar with these manners. Then we can sail through the ups and downs during our career life. Furthermore, doing a part time job is good to our study. Only learning the knowledge is far from enough, we also need practice. There is no doubt that doing a part time job is a great way for us to apply our knowledge to practice. Then we can get an idea of what we are short of, which can help us study better. Last but not least, doing a part time can form the sense of independent and perseverance, which is also of great importance to us. All in all, it is essential for college students to take a part time job. It does good to both ourselves and our job in the future.",CHN
"I agree this subject. I think that it is important to have a part time job for college student. Because colleges are not only the place where we study but also the place where we grow to be adult. It is important to communicate many people for adult. However, colleges are closed. Because we spend many times with limited people. For example, teachers and a part of friends. Other hand, a person who has a part time job meet many people every day. In society, it happens many times that it is acquired communication ability than working ability. For example, the person who belongs a company must communicate his costomar and collegue every day. If he did not communicate them, he would be regarded as a bad employee. If he has a good ability for his job, this case will happen. So, less communication ability might be a handicapped for working. We students should take a communication many other people at young time. It is clearly that college students must study. But college students are not persons who only write a sentence and calcurate a question. College students should has identity and ability to survive in society. A part time job helps college students to have them.",JPN
"Many people regard that college students should do some part time job because college students should come into contact with society. But I oppose college student only do some part time job but not do their theoretical knowledge well. Many students don't want to do their college homework, so the part-time job became the best excuse of tier lazy. But in other hands, college student have taken 12 years education in primary school and middle school and they have no chance to come into contact with society. so there are in inseparable connection between in social practice and heir college theoretical knowledge, we can't only do our social practice like part-time job but to do our theoretical knowledge, just like a primary school student can't do part time job. In the opposite side, if we only do our theoretical knowledge, we can't develop our social ability. It will become a serious problem of that we can't find a suitable job. But it's obvious that college theoretical knowledge is more important than having a part time job. Generally speaking, in our college, we should do our college theoretical knowledge well firstly. After that, if we have more time and energy, we can do some part time job for earning some money, accumulating social experience and so on. But if have some problem in our college study like studying or students' union, we should do our schoolwork first.",CHN

"Smoking is never a good thing for many people, especially in public places such as restaurants. First reason, the smell of cigarette will fill the air and mixed with the smell of the food. People will not have the appetite to eat if their food smells like cigarette, or can't smell their meal because of the cigarette. Moreover, some smokers don't have any respect for the other customers, they blow the smoke right from their mouth to other's faces or throw the ash of the cigarette on the floor or plates. Second reason, many people would avoid the restaurants those are filled with smokers, especially if they bring children with them. It's uncomfortable to eat while thinking about their children's health, since children are easier to get the effect of the secondhand smoke. The first two reasons could affect the income of the restaurants slowly and cause great deal of loss. The last reason, there are many people in the restaurant who will be the secondhand smokers which is very dangerous because secondhand smokers could get lung cancer and many other infections much easier then the smokers themselves. The victims are not only the guests, but also the worker and the passersby. All in all, smoking in a restaurant should be a forbidden thing and the smokers should be put in an isolated room.",IDN

Many non-smokers get much harm from smokers in the streets and restaurants. The second-hand smoking is more dangerous than first-hand smoking, especially for women and children. If children are exposed to smoking from their early ages, there is a higher chance for them to grow to become smokers. Moreover, banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country can be the first step to lower the smoking rate in countries. It is important to make the settings as inconvenient as possible for smokers, because if there is much convenience for smokers, more people will turn out to become smokers.

"Have you ever found that: when you have a dinner at a restaurant, you may see someone is smoking as if there are no other people around them? It is a common phenomenon in our society. And the question is that: shall we ban smoking at all the restaurant in the country?As for me, I don't think banning smoking in all restaurants is a good idea. We should give the right to the restaurant itself to make the decision. To begin with, banning smoking may hurt the restaurant's profit. If the restaurant bans smoking, it would make some customer who has a habit of smoking away from the restaurant, which will reduce its income. For some restaurants, if they have the single room for the customer, they can permit them smoke but not affect others. Then, this policy may influence people who have a habit of smoking. If all the restaurants ban smoking in the country, where can they have dinner? Absolutely, this will annoy many people. Last but not the least, I think it is not a feasible way to make this policy. The country is so large that we cannot make it practical to all of the restaurants. In general, I suggest that some of the restaurant should ban smoking; however, the other can permit smoking in the restaurant.",CHN

Firstly, we have a lot of free time in our college life, and we all know that we have no excuse to waste it. As a result of it, besides study and clubs, getting a part-time may be a wise choice.

"I am in favor of the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because some reasons listed below. First, no-smoking can show respect for others. Restaurants are public places in which there must be many people who are non-smoking or even hate the smoke of cigarettes. If you don't want to be blamed by others or spoil your image, you'd better get rid of your addictions to cigarettes. Second, the restaurant is a place to enjoy delicacies rather than cigarettes, so it is just not the right place for someone to light his cigarettes. Though I am non-smoking, I don't think it will be more delicious to eat with a cigarette or two. Third, as is known to all, smoking will do harm to our health. In that case, a total ban on smoking in a restaurant is a way to limit the number of cigarettes for heavy smokers, though the number can be limited is very small. In conclusion, restaurants are places where fresh air is needed and the smell of cigarettes will spoil the appetite of most guests. So, it is a reasonable measure to forbid smoking there. So let the government do something from now on to ban it.",CHN
"I agree with that statement. First, smoking has bad effect on our bodies. Once we smoke, it makes hard dependence. And they say smoking causes many cancers or any other sickness. It is said that smoking is dangerous for not only smoker but also no smoker. Some people say smoking is more dangerous for no smoker being near smoker rather than smoker. Second, restaurant is place we eat dinner or so. We enjoy it not only taste but also its smells or looks. When we feel smokes and dinner at the same time, interest to our dinner may be lost rapidly. Smoking makes bad feeling for not smokers but no smoker around them. It is a common thing, smoker smoke carefully, but smokes go to no smoker and make bad feeling. Third, if we make smoking space in Japanese restaurant, we must install machines that let smoke and dirty air go outside of the restaurant. That costs more expensive than making no smoking space. In Japan, it is extending to decrease smoking people. It is not necessary to built expensive restaurant against Japanese present tendency. According to these reasons, I agree with that statement.",JPN

It has become fashionable in the world today to condemn smoking. However, smoking is still dangerous to one's health and people around them, the smoker. I admit that cigarettes companies are the major contributors or large tax payers it helps our country but we suffer worse than we benefit. As 15 years old non smoker college student I have the perspective of a bad side of smoking. I am not fascinated by the benefit of smoking which is relaxation, how would you relax if your body is collapsing due to harmful or dangerous substances inside a single stick of cigarette. Smoking kills, Smoking causes cancer, second hand smoke is dangerous. Now, is there any major reason to contradict my allegations towards this smoking ban topic? Thus, Smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country. It must be banned due to dangerous fruits to the people who use it and people around a smoker.",PHL
"Do restaurants that you go have people smoking? Do you like it ? For people who don't smoke, Smell from smoking make someone crazy because smell make they feel dizzy and don't want to eat food. In some restaurant have a zone for smoking but some restaurant don't have. When people eat food, they catch a smell smoking. It make someone feel dizzy and vomit. Someone is allergic smoke because it make they feel ill. Not funny for them. If you go to restaurant for have a good time to eat a good food but you meet bad smell and smoke. But for smoker, they want to smoke anywhere that they want. Smoking is easy to taste but hard to stop. In my opinion, all the restaurants in the country don't have to ban smoking but should provide zone for smokers because smoking is right for everyone. We can't stop them. If all the restaurants in the country have zone for smoker, they will have more customer. Because this idea is good for everyone. People who not smoke get a good air and good meal and smoker can smoke. Everyone will happy and enjoy in food and will not have bad mood.",THA
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have three reasons. First, I don't like the smell. When I spend in the smoke long time, I feel bad mentally. In the restaurants, I eat delicious dishes and feel happy but if I smell the smoke, the happy feeling is over. Second, the smoke is very bad for our bodies. Not only the persons who smoke but also the all persons who are there are damaged. If we are there very long time, our lungs become black and its ability is down. Finally we will become lung cancer. the smoke is very bad physically too. Finally, the smoke erases the foods smell. In the restaurants of course foods need good tastes but their smells are necessary too. When I wait for dishes in the restaurants, I enjoy the smell. The smell makes me happy so the waiting time is very important for me when I eat in the restaurants, but if someone smokes, I can not feels the foods smell. It means that the worth of the restaurants become down. I don't want to say that people must not smoke completely but in the restaurants, smokers should not smoke.",JPN
"It was said that knowledge does not exist only in your classroom. In my opinion, it is good for college students to have a part-time job because students can earn more money from it, and it gives more experience and opportunity for students' future occupation. Having more pocket money is students' dream, and a part-time job can do. Most teenagers have a problem about lack of money. Some of them want to buy something special, but they do not have enough money for it. Some use money up before the end of a week or a month. So, they do a part-time job to earn more money. Although the job gives a little amount of money, it requires such a little quality worker that students can apply. A part-time job can be a great opportunity for students' future. The students can find out what they like, what they can do, and what they are good at. They also experience some critical situations and how to do with it. When they are grown-up, their experience makes them more efficient than the other. That means they have more chance to be successful workers. Despite of tiredness and a low wage, a part-time job gives college students a lot of advantages. The students can manage their time to get more money, more experience, and more opportunity that they never get from their school.",THA
"Nowadays, there is a heated debating about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Different people hold the different opinions. You cannot image how terrible it is for a college student to have a part-time job, people who object to the opinion emphasize this. From the point of their view, it is the course-studying that we college students should concentrate on and doing a part-time job wastes plenty of our time, what is worse, what it brings us in wealthy is far less than what it takes us in time and knowledge. They also assume that we will earn more in future in return once we contribute all of our time to studying during college, it's a further investment. While, when it comes to the topic, the others put the great agreement on college students to have a part-time job. They stress that no matter how rich or poor we are, we should go for a job in college, and it's not a matter of earning money, but an opportunity to close to society. What's more, it's not merely for us students to accumulate the experience, but a chance to apply what we learn in class to the reality. Taking part-time jobs will obviously do much good to student; it's not a waste of time, not to speak to the short-sighted. What is known to used all is that every coin has two sides, but as to have a part-time job, I think, we students benefit from it more than what we lose from it, and what the society really needs isã€€typed talent, but not the ones who can recite a great many articles, who can tell a quantity of theories, or who can just write a pile of useless papers.",CHN
"Many students in college have done the part time job. This phenomenon is very general. So do I, I did a restaurant waiter last summer vacation. In that time, I felt very happy. Although being a waiter was happy, I faced many challenges in the beginning. First, I had to remember all the names of dishes on the menu and introduce to customers. Second, there were a lot of dirty dishes and bowls I had to wash. Sometimes, I had to stand the complaint from customers or the blame from the boss. I felt very tired in the initial stage. Gradually, I was familiar with my job. I knew how to communicate with customers and solve the problems by myself. I was not in a great bustle anymore. I also learn some easy recipes and I can cook delicious food at home. Now, I am good at cleaning the dishes and cooking. Doing the part time job makes me earn much money and learn more experiences. Some working experiences will be very useful and helpful in the future. I also make a lot of friends through the part time job. Doing the part the job gives me a different experience.",TWN

Smoking is dengerous for healthy it make lung cancer although we do not smoking but smoke dengerous for your life too and it make dirty teeth and make every body hate you not only make you bad healthy but also make you pay a lot of money to buy cigarette and your family will leave to you so I think we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country not only at all the restaurants but also ban smoking every place where's have many people especially children such as the park the mall the zoo the school the university the bus stop the hospital the temple the airport and we should ban and prevent our family to smoking so people who smoking should relized to people around them and you should smoking far away from risk place or they should stop smoking for yourself for your family and for every body around you if you want to stop smoking you can chewing gum or canby and you should exercise such as play tennis go swimming play badminton go shopping etc replace smoking because when you can stop smoking you will have good health and long life to make useful for other people.,THA
"There can be several kinds of people in a restaurant such as kids, elders, teenagers, and adults. We can never know if someone has a problem with smoke coming out from cigarettes. But we all know for sure about the toxic elements in cigarette smoke which will never benefit your health and, of course, anyone else's too. And I don't think that smoking in the restaurant benefits at all cost. Many restaurants are not an open-air, so if someone smokes inside the smoke can go around that area, everyone gets that smoke. Even the open-air restaurants people who sit around a smoking person still can get the smoke. The person who smokes may not think that smoking is bad, or even not care about who is going to be effected when they light a cigarette. Besides, the percentage of non-smoking people is much more than the smoking people. So if it is allowed to smoke in a restaurant, the non-smoking people might not go into that restaurant. And that would be bad for the restaurant itself. The obvious example is me. Whenever I smell the cigarette smoke I would have a headache, and I will walk out of that area with no hesitation. Therefore, I strongly agree with the opinion ""Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country"".",THA
"Well they have a lot of bans in the USA about smoking now so I don't see why Japan shouldn't do the same. I mean smoking is a real 'drag' anyway and I am sure that I am not going to throw my dollars away on something that is going to kill me. Not much point in doing that now and I would rather spend it on my music anyway. Most of my buddies think the same as I do. And even though my dad still smokes, he is always telling me to don't start smoking and I wonder why he just doesn't stop. I guess that it is pretty hard to do from what I hear. I think that the bans are a good thing and that they might help people like my dad cut down at least, as well as make the restaurants and clubs smell a bit fresher. I am not too sure where else the people can go to in Japan to smoke aside from those smelly glass rooms that smell like giant ashtrays. I think that they maybe should think about giving the smokers a better smoking room so they don't have to stay outside in the rain or snow like they do here.",ENS
"Have you ever worked as part-timer while you study your major in university? A lot of university students have worked at various area of place such as restaurant, theater, store and so on. ]The majority of students worked after class or when they have enough time. As working, students can make money and experience regarding major or style of living. I think that it is important for university students to have a part-time job in several reasons. First, university students can make extra money except for pocket money from parents. I had worked a lot of place such as Masaya, Baskinrobbins 31, Crispy CrÃ¨me, Mr. Pizza, save zone and so on. As working, I could have had installment savings and paid a charge of cell phone myself. So, I lighten my parent's burden. Furthermore, students who earn an own tuition have been increasing. Second, we can learn about style of living at working place. When I was part-timer at work place, I have to greet politely, face kindly and smile always to customers. So, I was changed more kindly and calmingly than before. Also, I could have patience for people. If you waste your extra time, challenge part-time job. You can lighten your parent's burden and learn about upright personalities. Summer vacation is coming. What are you doing now? Just do it!",KOR
"I think that it is importantfor college students to do part-time jobs. First this is because they have to spend much money for playing, traveling, club activities and so on. If they don't spend money for playing, they will need a lot of money for commuting to university. If you were a high school student, your parents would pay the cost when you want to buy something. But college students should not depend on their parents so much, and they should try to lead independent lives. Of course, I don't insist that it is bad for themm to receive economical supports from their parents. I just want to say that it is important for them to earn money, even if the salary is low. Second this is because they can't waste their own salary. They can learn how difficult people earn money by doing part-time jobs. So when they spend money, they think carefully whether the cost is proper or not. The difficulty of earning money prevent them from wasting money. Third this is because doing part-time jobs is the practice to be a respectable member of society. They will understand the rule of the society while they are working. college students are generally regarded as adults. So they have to contribute to the society. Doing part-time jobs is the large part of college students duty. In order to enjoy the college life they have to work hard.",JPN

I agree, in restaurants not smoking, because this place have many people, for example, older and child and smoke is danger for them. The most important for student'should not smoking in all place' and should be to relax or exercise, for example, play sport, play games, swimming, and activities, for example, shopping at department store, go to see this all example better than smoking, because this example to help our and smoker have good health.

"Smoking should be banned at all restaurant because a passive smoker will got a bigger chance to got disease. In a restaurant, we usually find a smoker and they just sitting in the room with their smoke filling that room. Many people in that room are passive smoker and in this situation an active smoker just one person while the passive smoker are many person. Indonesia has many smoker and it is impossible to make all places to become no smoking zone. Government had made a plan about smoking area to hold the smoke to go outside. But, this plan doesn't really works. Many smokers just smoking outside smoking area these days. And they make Indonesia hotter and hotter.

"The statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants is a good policy in theory, but in reality there are many people who go to restaurants to enjoy smoking and drinking while eating. Theses people make up a significant customer base for the food and beverage industry. I think that what law makers should do is pass the responsibility of protecting nonsmoking customers onto the restaurant owners. One way to do this is by charging higher taxes to restaurants with poor ventilation systems or without a barrier separation between smoking and nonsmoking sections. I believe that if the restaurant has taken reasonable steps to separate the smokers from non-smokers, then they have done their job to make sure that all customers have a comfortable dining experience. Instead of banning smoking, another way to stem the smoking vs. nonsmoking controversy is to increase in the number of non-smoking restaurants and cafes. At this time many popular cafes, such as Starbucks have had tremendous success with promoting a smoke free environment inside the cafe. As the nonsmoking culture becomes increasingly popular, smokers will find a ways to curb their smoking appetites while dining. Overall, the best way to solve this situation is to give customers a choice.",ENS
"In recent years, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study. Should we put the blame on part-time jobs? Is it a good thing for college students to work part time? I think we need to think about this question carefully from different sides. It is true that excellent academic: qualifications are something essential if you want to find a good job after you leave school. But on the other hand, for those who can easily get high marks in examinations, it is worth trying to find something to do in their spare time. Then they can get some work experience which is as valuable as their academic achievement. From what I have said, it is difficult to judge whether taking part time jobs is good or bad. It depends on how you deal with the relationship between working and learning. If you can balance it well, you are sure to get enough knowledge as well as working experience, so as to get ready for you future success. So we can just say that doing part-time job can be good for some people and not so good for others. It just depends on your situations.",CHN
"Smoking is harmful for us. Though many people know this simple truth, they still smoke in public places, especially restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely at restaurants. Firstly, everyone knows that cigarettes have bad component which can cause cancer. So we should smoke less or we'd better not smoke cigarette whether we're at restaurants. Secondly, if one person smokes at restaurant, other people around him will be affected and those people may suffer the second hand smoke. In fact, it is unfair to the people who do not smoke. However, not only does the smoker damage his health, he also damages other people's health. In my view, no one should have the ""right"" to inflict a health hazard on anyone else. And it's necessary to ban smoking completely at all restaurants. Furthermore, if someone really wants to smoke, he can go outside and have a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he can come in. All in all, we should have the right attitude towards smoking. Though some people enjoy the pleasure which is brought by the smoking, we should recognize the harmful aspects of smoking. Smoking in public is not only a hazard for the smokers and every smoker must take responsibility for other people around. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.",CHN
"In my opinion, smoking should be banned on all the restaurants in the Philippines. This is because restaurants are purposely invented to sustain the hunger customers are experiencing. It is invented mainly to serve foods and drinks not to provide such entertainment that may cause harm to other people. Moreover, it would be unfair to other customers if smoking on restaurants is tolerable. Others who go to restaurants to dine and those who serve the restaurant may endure diseases caused by inhalation of smoke produced by cigarettes. It is very dangerous to the health most especially to second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers are those who do not directly inhale smoke and eventually digest it into their lungs. They are the ones who unintentionally inhale smokes produced by smokers. Restaurants should not only consider gaining profit but also consider the effects their services might cause to their customers. Their main goal should provide services that may produce good effects to their customers. Health is a lot more important than money. It should be considered first before anything else. It would be better if certain industries should construct areas which are only made to serve smokers. This is to prevent certain diseases such as cancer committed through the inhalation of smoke.",PHL
"After graduating from high school, a child will become an adult. To register for college enrollment, students no longer need parental guidance. Some of them chose to live around campus, either they who come from the city campus or they who come from other cities. After college, a child will become independent. Nevertheless, the need for a college student is much greater than the needs of a student. College students need more expenses for eat, copies of textbooks, print tasks, internet, and others. For some college students, money given from their parents are no longer sufficient to finance their daily lives. Thus, some of them need to do part-time job. On the sidelines of their activities on campus, college students can fill their spare time with part-time job. Part-time job can increase their pocket money. In addition, part-time job can add to the experience of students in the world of work. Most of the part-time job related to their field of expertise learned during college. Thus students can apply their knowledge in preparation for the job later. Work does not must in the company. Working part time can also be done on campus.

"Whether or not college students want to have a part-time job or not should be purely up to their own discretion. Personally, I do not find it especially important whether or not college students to have a part-time job. In college, there are a wide variety of clubs and societies available to the student population. These clubs and societies may in essence be the last of its kind that college students can join before they graduate and move on into the corporate world. I feel that by joining these club and societies, students will be able to enjoy a much more enriching University life as compared to if they were holding a part-time job whilst studying. Everyone knows that University life is the last part of a person's education journey if they do not intend to pursue post-graduate degrees. As such, instead of starting work a few years earlier, why not put on hold working thoughts to after graduation. There are certain things in life that cannot be compensated for. If you do not make full use of the opportunity to enrich your University life by engaging in University activities now, there will not be a second chance for you to do so in the future. This draws me back to my statement whereby it is purely up to one's own discretion whether or not to hold part-time jobs in college because at the end of the day, it is a personal choice. ",SIN
"Smoking is an expensive habit and it should be banned. Although smokers claim that it helps them to relax and release stress, the negative aspects of the habit outweigh the positive. It is a health hazard for both smokers and non-smokers and it is especially harmful to unborn babies. Cigarettes are also addictive because of the nicotine they contain. Cigarette smoking causes a number of health problems which are expensive to treat. It is a major cause of respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer and bronchitis. It also leads to heart disease. In spite of the money which the Government receives from taxing cigarettes, the cost of medical treatment for these diseases exceeds this income. As a consequence, non smoking taxpayers are forced to pay for the health costs of smokers. This is a very unfair situation. Another reason for banning smoking is that cigarette smoke affects the health of non-smokers and unborn babies. Non-smokers soften suffer from eye and nose irritations, allergies and headaches as a result of inhaling second-hand smoke. There is also evidence to suggest that passive smoking may cause lung cancer. Smoking during pregnancy can hinder to growth of the foetus and may even result in death.

"As we all know, college students have a lot of time to live their own life. They can control their life freely and do what they like and what they want. People are discussing whether it is important for college students to do part-time job. Like one coin has two sides, advantages and disadvantages exist as to it. On the one hand, it is good for us to have a part-time job. To start with, along with the high pace of the modern world, more and more companies pay more attention to word experience. They must do a good job to promote their ability. Their practice will enable them to better understand what they learned from books. Students can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job-hunting. What's more, they can earn some money though these experiences. It can make the students realized that it is hard to make money. One of the most important reasons is that let them know the hardship of making money. Then they can develop a habit of saving money. During this period they can know how much they owe to them. Part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families and cannot afford to pay college fees. Last but not the least, it opens them a window to know about the society, which is essential to their maturity. On the other hand, if we break the balance our study and work, it makes no sense. Study is of importance to us students. We must spend most of our time in study to reach our goal. We must deal with our study and work well, spend their spare time taking part-time jobs. Only following this principle can they benefit from their part-time jobs.",CHN
"Smoking should be banned in all restaurant in the country. Smoking in restaurants could affect other customers in the restaurant. This could cause discomfort for other customers. Some people lose their appetite in eating when they smell smoke of the cigarette. Other customers do not like the smell of tobacco thus smoking in restaurants could cause minor or major conflicts between the customers. Restaurants are considered as a sign of elegance and class, if people would smoke in restaurants, it would tarnish the image of a respectable restaurant. It could also destroy the sanitation in the restaurant since the smell of the smoke is not pleasant to the human nose. Improper sanitation of restaurant could lead to the closing of the particular restaurant. Originally, restaurant s are not the proper place for smokers to consume their cigars since, since restaurants are places where people could dine properly. Smoking is not considered as dining. Cigarettes are not counted as food or a substitute for a meal. Smoking should be allowed only in certain places and the restaurants are not included in those places. Smoking may be considered a meal for other Filipinos but they should not be done on places such as restaurants.",PHL
"Yes, I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking destroys the ambience of the restaurant and the dining experience. Imagine trying to enjoy a meal in a high-class and polished restaurant with cigarette smoke wafting all around. The image just does not match! Firstly the smell of cigarette smoke is unpleasant and this interferes with the diners' tasting of the food. As we all know, the senses of smell and taste are strongly linked together and one does not work as well without the other. This is the reason why we cannot seem to enjoy our food as much when our nose is blocked as we cannot smell the food. Similarly, since the smell of smoke overpowers the smell of food, diners will be unable to enjoy their food as much. Thus, if restaurants want to enhance the dining experience for the diners, they should ban smoking in their restaurants. Secondly, smoking is bad for health. Notwithstanding the personal health detriments that smoking brings, it also adversely affects the health of other people. This is not fair to the non-smokers because they did not choose to breathe in second-hand smoke. Allowing smoking also does not align with the image of health-conscious and organic restaurants. Thus, for the better health of the diners, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. ",SIN
"When students reach the tertiary level of their education, most people, especially the older generation, would expect them to be independent and more mature. It is often recognized as the time where the person finds his/her own self and takes responsibility for whatever step he/she takes in his/her journey in finding his/her own identity. Having a job at this early time somehow helps the students in their path to self-knowledge. Earning money through their own tears and hardship will open their eyes to their future life after school; the real life, as what they say. It helps them manage themselves properly and find their strengths and at the same time, their weaknesses. Having a job doesn't only mean that they gain profit, but rather, it also helps them gain knowledge. Also, it is a big help to their family who have supported their education for at least the past nine years of their life. It would be their way of uplifting the burden on the shoulders of the people who've helped them reach where they are now.

"It is very important for college students to have a part time job in another country if they are study overseas.

Usually the students spend their money to buy something that useless for their daily need; they buy for their prestige only not for their requirement. Another reason is not everyone in this world are rich people. If your parents are a very rich people, I think you shouldn't work part time because your parent can give all of your daily need.

"Is a part time job important to university students? As a university student, I do not have a part time job. But I do think a part time job is quite essential to an undergraduate. There are several reasons behind. Firstly, university fees are high. Having a part time job, a student can earn money in order to pay for part of the fees in the university. This can ease the strain of the bread winner of the family. Secondly, having some working experience before graduated can be an advantage when you apply for jobs in the future. Employers in all companies will prefer to employ a person with rich experience than a person with none. Thirdly, having a part time job can practice the time management skill of a student.

Some people become addict due to their bad company of friends. Some people smoke for just little enjoyment and thus become the part of their life. One of its biggest reasons is tension. It has many adverse affects like wastage of money, damages health. Disliking of people. It is reduced by taking good measures by the governments. By advertisements ban smoking ceminars by NGOs.

"A student is like an insurance of any thing for country, is should be maintained with attention, firstly it takes from our side but it returns by doubling it up when there are no other sources remained. If we do not care about our precious things, we do not provide them appropriate service these are spoiled & depreciated before the time. Same like with students because they are the Future falcons of a country. We can say that a student's life is the busiest age of his whole life because he learns new things everyday, every hour and every minute. While in practical life he implements these learning to get benefit and to be succeeded in every field of life. Proper environment, able teachers and opportunities to progress are the basic needs of a student. These needs are attained by only few lucky students because these are being costly like every other thing in this country. Government institutes are unable to provide these things because of bribery, corruption, carelessness and such other evils. Blockage of opportunities and limited resources are causing inflation. Income of a common man is same but expenditures are doubling up. The rates of books, notebooks and most importantly fees are going out of hands of even a middle class person. Except these unachievable expenses many of youngsters are so that they are in the age of study but they have to feed their family also, they have to fulfill their educational dues as well as household expenses. That's a tough task and not everyone is capable of such strong responsibility. Although student has a busy life and faces many tough tasks to be successive in his educational field in such a competitive age However, he has to perform a part time job as well because the present situations require it; otherwise he may have to leave his studies when there would be no resources left.",PAK
"I think that it is very important for college student to do some part time jobs. At this age, they are not just a baby of their parents anymore. They are not also just students of the school anymore who can't do his or her own works alone. As a college student, they have to prepare for their independent life when graduating from the school. Therefore, they have to learn how to earn the money to sustain their lives themselves. To be sure, all the money that needs to sustain lives can't be earned by part time job but at least they have to earn their allowance themselves. In addition, parents will not worry about their living when they become an independent worker in the society. Some people can say that they are still students so they have to concentrate on their study for the future job and life. However, if they can plan their schedule appropriately to gain both money and knowledge, they will be successful not only on their money but also on their job. In real, most of the college students are doing two those things nowadays. If those who are not experienced enough to work for money in their college life, they will feel difficult easily when they are alone in the society.",KOR
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Are you one of the people that smoking at restaurants? Nowadays, there a lot of people complaining that they want to ban smoking at restaurants, what do you think about it? In my opinion, two major benefits of smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country are disturbing others and risk of accidents. First, smoking at the restaurants is disturbing others such as; children, women and pregnant women. Others people at restaurant will be disturbed by smell and smoke from smoking. Smoke from cigarette is contains substances that are harmful to human's body. So, smoking at the restaurants is disturbing others and also harmful to the body. Second, smoking at the restaurants has a risk to be an accident. Smoking can not be without fire and chef at restaurant can not cooking some food without gas, if the smokers lack of caution. It has a chance to be an accident. In conclusion, smoking at the restaurant should be banned by two major benefits. It disturbing others and harmful to the human's body.

"More and more students have part-time jobs when they study in college. I have a mixed feeling about it. In my opinion, it depends on different situations. On one hand, some students are not good at their studying and they should pay more effort in their homework and previewing. For these students, it's not wise to have a part-time job. On other hand, most students have no barrier in their studying. It's not enough for these students to study theory in college. They should practice more and use their learned knowledge in practicing. The best way to practice is finding a part-time job and there have two benefits. One is students can get experience from job which is beneficial for them to find job. The other one is they can earn extra money from job and it can strengthen their ability in independence. In addition, most students who has part time job have the problem that how much time they should spend in their job. It's important for students to deal well with this problem; otherwise it will make a bad influence in their studying. All in all, students should choose carefully whether or not to find a part-time job.",CHN
"One thing I know is smoking does not do anything good to a man's body and even to the environment. Millions of people die because of different illness caused by smoking. There's lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and many other serious illnesses that can cause one's death. Stating these facts, many people still engage themselves in smoking. That's why some countries banned smoking in public places. Smoking in public places especially in restaurants is definitely a NO, NO. One, it is surrounded by many people and they may acquire second-hand smoke. Next is, there may be children in that place and it is not a good example seeing elderly smoking in front of them. Smoker might reason that they need to smoke after they eat so they can avoid having gastritis. Restaurant is a place where people eat and not for smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from fume and smell. It's not good for people to smell smoke because scientist and doctors says it is more dangerous that if you inhale a smoke from the smoke inhaled by another person, which is called second-hand smoke. It is said that non-smokers exposed in second-hand smoke increase their risk of lung cancer. The government of the Philippines starts banning smoking in public places. In my own opinion, smoking must be banned in restaurants and even in other public places because it affects people's health even those who are not smoking. But this will also affect the democracy of the country, people's right to choose and do whatever they want as long as they're responsible for what they're doing. But above all these, banning of smoking should start in our home. Parents should be the first one who will lecture their children that smoking is not a good practice.",PHL

"College students need lots of money because they have to pay tuition fee. Also they need fee of transportation and they have to buy lunch. All these expenses are very big deal to students. Registration of school is very expensive. Many students receive money from their parents but it is limited. Therefore, having a part-time job is required by students. Students can help their parents' worry by doing a part-time job. Even students are busy for school works, they can feel satisfaction. In my case, my parents give me money once a month. I have no part-time jobs. I have to spend money for reasonable price every time. Sometimes, I want to buy a brand-new clothe or an expensive bag. But my pocket has limit so I can't buy something that written on my wish list. If I have a part-time job, I can buy clothes or a bag. However, having a part-time job makes me tired and very busy so I don't want to have a part-time job. Gathering money is easier to me than earning money.

"I do not agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many college students with one or more part-time job. Although it is beneficial in a variety way to have working experience during campus life, but it is not so crucial for every college students. Being a college student, I have some friends working as a part-timer. Some of them can give consideration to the both side, but some failed. I think it is more important to work hard on schoolwork than on part-time work. I have even heard that some college students skip classes to go to their part-time, which is obviously overlooking their study. Here is another reason why I do not regard having a part-time job is significant to college students. There is much more experience we could go through except part-time jobs in our college, and once if we miss them, we are less likely to have another chance after we graduated. For example, we can go to student clubs, or be a volunteer in a charity. We can learn many things when we participate in those groups. Based on these reasons above, I think we should plan our college life with more concern; if we have chances to enrich our life in college, why bother spending our precious time working on part-time jobs?",TWN

" College students are a group of special kids. They are independent and have a particular view to our society. To such a group of people, having a part time job is a thing that can express their values. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are three reasons. At first, having a part time job can make college students know more about our society. With the development of society, competition becomes more and more fierce. How to have a good ability to do more, part time jobs give a chance to take advance to step into the society, and learn more to be a businessman. And second, having a part time job can help a lot of students whose families are not very well. Maybe it can make them go to university, and have a better meal. What's more? Having a part time job can give you confidence and a sense of accomplishment. It would be important for one who wants to grow up.

Such as facing very different kinds of people, I believe those experience will become your skill to solve the problem in job of the future. Second, I met some important friend of my life, it's just like a little society but not that complicated as the full job. Develop the great friendship is important and helpful to ourselves. Third, I think it could let student become more independent that students have a part-time job. I earn the money by self, and I think it could learn how to use and separate my salary in my school life, those necessary payment like eating, shopping, playing.... etc. After all, almost college students stayed in the university about four years.

Smoking is adopted by the people to sooth themselves and relax themselves but they are either unaware of it's after effects or want to get rid of this life. Smokers actually don't care to face the reality of life and run away like cowards. Young generation is more include in this evil activity due to its temptation. Smoking cause headache, nausea etc. but the biggest and the foremost problem caused by smoking is destruction of lungs years after years. Smokers become lazy and vague. Sold bread earns become fatigued and unable to run their families. Students are reduced of failure. The above discussion clearly implies that smoking is injurious in all respects to people. But smoking in public places should be restricted especially to avoid or prevent teen ages to get the temptation of smoking. Any smokers could give firstly free of cost (cigarette) to anyone for any purpose. Secondly, the smoker produced or released by cigarette contains concingocnic materials and very harmful gases which may damage the lunges of the person sitting by him.

"We all know that smoking is dangerous to our health as it is already put on almost half of the front of the cigarette pack but how many of us know that whenever a smoker smokes a cigarette, the dangers of smoking is brought not only to the smoker, but also the people who inhales the smoke? A cigarette contains ingredients that are mostly toxic. When a smoker exhales the smoke from the cigarette, some of the toxic properties of the cigarette come with the smoke and when others inhale the smoke, now called a secondhand smoke, they will also consume those properties. Study shows that an equivalent of a cigarette smoke is the smoke coming from the exhaust system of a car. Both are as toxic as the other. Imagine inhaling smoke coming from cars, all of those toxic things inside your lungs. The result of inhaling secondhand smoke from a cigarette smoker is lung cancer, a very fatal and incurable disease. The death of smokers is nearly the same as those who died of secondhand smoke, a survey shows. Therefore, with all these points raised, I say we should ban smoking in public places, especially restaurants as nonsmokers find it unpleasant to eat while smelling the scent of cigarettes.",PHL
"I agree with the statement. Because I hate smoking, I think that it most be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is known everyone that smoking is very bad for human health. Because I knew it, I have hated smoker since I have a child. I can't understand their feelings. Of course, there is no smoker in my family and relatives. But, actually, there are some smoker in my friends. One day, they said that if they wanted to give up smoking, but they couldn't. I think it is very horrible that if I want to give up smoking, but I cant. I disagree with that there is a smoker near my around. I want to enjoy having lunch or dinner purely at restaurant. But, there are smoker near my around when I have lunch or dinner at restaurant, I can't enjoy them. If I encounter the situation, I feel some foods very terrible if they are taste very good.

"I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Because there are some faults. I would like to write about them. Firstly it ignores human rights of smokers. Smoking surely causes harm to people in surround. But smokers have right of smoking. It is no good that we one-sidedly force our opinions. Secondly managers of restaurants lose the revenue by ban the smoking. Because banning the smoking prevent guests of smoker go to the restaurant. So the number of guests decreases and the revenue also decreases. Thirdly restaurant is precisely the place where guest comfortably enjoys eating. For smokers it is necessary to smoking to have a good time. Therefore banning smoking is equal with disturbing smokers' right of enjoying. Finally banning smoking treats nonsmoker well and treats smokers coldly. This is a kind of discrimination. Even kids know that discrimination is bad. It pays attention to only nonsmokers. For such reason, I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. But I agree with placing some nonsmoking seats, because it reflects nonsmokers' rights. This way brings equality between smoker and nonsmoker. However, it is not probably best way. I would like to study deeply and find the better way.",JPN
"Before we begin on the topic of discussion, it is crucial to first identify the scope of the discussion topic, which will be limited to Singapore in order to facilitate the discussion to a more effective level that is familiar to me. In this case, a college student is assumed to be one that is currently studying in a junior college in Singapore, and based on my personal experiences and the experiences shared by my friends, I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, with reasons laying around how they will eventually affect the student from achieving their full-potential. Although college students can be argued to be able to pick up valuable life experiences in working from their part-time job, it is not crucial for them to work because they are not mature enough to handle situations at work which they may be exposed to. Also, having a part-time job can be argued to have detrimental effect on college students' grades should they not manage their time well. In fact, since a junior college is an express path that leads them to a university, it is crucial that they perform well enough to enter a university and a course of their choice that will ultimately decide their future career, so it is not essential for college students to get a part-time job but to perform their role as a student well.

"Smoking, as universally admitted, has many long-term negative impacts on health. Though this is already a public knowledge, people smoking is still of great percentage. The underlying reason can be sorted into 2 categories: culture and economy. Cultural influence is one of the paramount feature in the prevailing of smoking. It's presented in 2 opposite aspects. For one, smoking is related to some other positive meanings in social life. The most favored strategy of tobacco company is utilizing the influence of celebrities. By employing celebrities to be their spokesperson, they transfer the meaning of smoking from a harmful enjoyment to a symbol of social status and a symbol of superior lifestyle. It conveys a message of smoking can upgrade one's taste and convert him or her into a more respecting person. For another, the society is not opposing this manner strongly enough. It's more regarded as a rather unfavored practice in the public area than something that people shouldn't do. Considering the negative effect of smoking on the smoker himself and on the environment, the attitude society hold towards it is rather mild. Economic feature directly cause the rather subtle situation of smoking. The tobacco industry contributes a remarkable percentage of government revenue, which determines the rather resentful attitude of government in dealing with elimination of smoking activity.",HKG
"I extremely agree with the topic, don't you want to lost your nice feeling while sitting in the restaurants just cause by the smoker? Surely, most people in this planet think about themselves more than the others. So that is the cause to have nowadays crime. In the restaurants, there are many signs about ""Don't Smoking""; you can see them in all of the poles and in the walls there. Banning about smoking in the restaurants must be having an extremely taboo for in first time, I think. How we can do it? At first, Have enough security guards, then show the sign note ""Don't Smoking"" and follow with ""Fine (the most expensive pride) on one cigarette"" Do that together with when someone or some people against that sign, Call the security guards to manage on them. If every restaurant can do that, nice feeling that leads someone going to go to restaurant where is the place for meeting with old friends, for dinner in the great time with the family, for celebrating with the victory, for dating with beautiful girl and nice boy, and especially for relaxing yourself with the great meal for charting energy in your body to doing your job excellently.",THA
"Studying for college after years of studying grade school and high school can be a monumental task for some.

This creates all sorts of problems for society as more youth have no decent education. Some of the less-fortunate turn to part-time jobs as their way of alleviating their financial problems. They study while working to earn money just to pay their school dues.. One of the main reasons for a college student to have a part-time job is financial problems. Some college students have difficulty in paying their school dues and are forced to take on a part-time job; however, I still believe that they must not take on part-time jobs. There are scholarships available for less-fortunate yet deserving students. Some scholarships even give out stipends or allowances. A part-time job for a college student has advantages like, having financial support in their studies, job experience and knowledge; however it has its disadvantages like, less time for studying and more fatigue. College students should be concentrating on their studies, not on looking for ways to pay their tuition. Paying their tuition should be the job of the parents or guardians of the student.

And if we earn some money, we can notice how important money is. So we need to earn money for ourselves. Second reason is that we can make many friends. If we have part-time job, we can meet different people from those who we can meet at a college. There may be a person who is older or younger than you. And so, by talking with them, we can share our thoughts and make more friends. Last reason is that we can learn manners. When we talk with customers, we have to speak politely.

"I think have part-time job experiences for students in their college life are important. In my opinions, first, most of students don't have to leave their hometown and don't have to do every thing by themselves before they become freshmen. As became a freshman, students might have to leave their hometown far for good university and parents might tell them that you should deal with everything by yourself include your costs for live. So this is definitely a good chance to training them. Second, they can learn a lot of rules and professional knowledge about the job and methods for make friends by having part-time job experience. It is useful for training them and makes their world wider. Besides, friends who known in part-time job might be important in their future. For instance, in part-time job, they might find their best friend even soul mate, and can find friends or bosses that can give a hand in their futures job as they meet some difficult. When doing part-time job or the life in the university it can be look as a little society, so before enter the real society, it can be a good chance to practice and find fault to make themselves more sophisticated. I think having part-time job experiences might make it easier and useful for students to find good jobs.",TWN
"Part time job is a kind of job which enable the workers to work half time than full job. For the college student, part time job is solution to get money without leave their study. beside that, part time is very useful some college student to earn money in easy way. But, all of that can be a good way if the college student can manage the time. if they can't, it will be a serious problem. The student who have a part time job and can't manage the time usually broke their result in test even that happen. They still work and study in the same time, because of that many worker student done their study without a good grade. The resolution of this problem is, the college student can get a part time job when they done 2 years in study (usually call as senior student). why 2 years? Because student have done 2 years in study is a student who have a skill to manage the time. Beside it, the senior college student's mental is harder than new student and even they got bad result. They can fixed it without disturb they work. Part time job for the senior student is also help them to prepare themselves to get a real job and prepare them to be a quality worker.",IDN
"At the present, a lot of people died because of smoking and still have some people who risk to get a cancer. I agree with this statement that we should banned smoking in restaurants. In my opinion, nowadays smoking is seemed to be normal for the most people. They like to smoke in everywhere. Restaurant is a place where family likes to have dinner or have a nice time together or some people use it for meeting. So, this place has different ages such as children, teenager, adult and old people. If someone has smoking in restaurant, it could effected with people who surround smoker, imagine that how many people surround him will be a second smoker and it also effected on themselves. An atmosphere also was destroyed. And I think it not fair that they didn't smoke but why they had to get that bad effect from someone who they don't know. We should do something to protect people from this effect and I agree with this way and think that it will be better if all the restaurants have a rule that not allow smoking in there. And when they start to use it, I think it will be a point that attracts people to come in.",THA
"I think the part time job is not important for college students It is wasting time to study and they will have low grade in test. Also they doesn't have time to do they are homework And they are going to part time job at night or morning They will be tired or exhausted. Then they slept in the class Or they can't concentrate in class. And they want money for what? They earned money for tuition? Some students are working at night for tuition of college. But other students are working for they are leisure time. They doing part time job, earned money and they spend it For travel the club, buy a jewel or elect, and drinking with them are friends And they not interested in class. They have low attendance rate of class. Reason of this things, I disagree the part time job for college students These things are not much necessary things for college students. And they don't have to do part time job except poor students They must quit the part time job, and they doing best for they are class or homework It is the best way for college students that don't doing part time job.",KOR
"Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in this country for the following three reasons. First, restaurants are places where people eat food, and the disgusting smells of cigarettes hinder the proper taste and smell of the food served at the restaurants. The smell does not even disappear quickly no matter how much ventilation is provided. Second, secondhand smoking is very harmful to everyone's health. No one has the right to harm other people's health. Smoking in public places is an extremely selfish act, and it should rightfully banned by the law. It is ironic that even those who smoke do not want to smell the smoke from other people. Recent studies say that people who die from secondhand smoking reaches up to about 60 million people throughout the world. Third, restaurants are places for families. A lot of children come to these places to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants not only harms these children, but it also gives negative effect for their education. Children, who see people violating other people's rights from their childhood, have higher chances to do exactly the same thing when they grow up. Restaurants can be places where even the families with infants can come.",KOR
"Smoking in public places is disturbing other people who do not smoke, especially when someone smoking in restaurants. The smoke can contaminate foods of other people who were eating. Of course this is depriving others who do not smoke, and should be forced to become passive smoking. Of course the ban prohibited smoking in any place, especially in restaurants, it needs to be applied anywhere. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems for the smoker. Even had done the research, a second-hand smoke have more severe negative effects than active smokers. Want to ban smoking in public places instead of seizing the rights of a smoker. You still will have the right to smoke in their own space without having to rob the rights of others who do not smoke. Because other people who do not smoke also have the same right to free cigarette smoke. If we still find people who do not abide by rules set by the government or the owner of the restaurant, sometimes we must dare to reprimand him or give innuendo. If the person cannot ignore these warnings, it helps if we are going and avoid that person. Since we are going to feel the impact of the loss compared to that person. Because in addition to inhaling cigarette smoke, we will also be humiliated in public because it is deemed too critical and fussy.",IDN
"As more and more students taking part-time job, there is concern today about the advantage and disadvantage of doing part-time job. For our college students, part-time job can partly offer our study as the tuition fees have greatly increased and our bank systems fail to loan student effectively. On the anther hand, part-time job also get them know the hardship of earning money in order to change their bad habits. In order to be confronted with the challenge that more and more companies pay attention to work experience, they will feel easier when they attend job if they have part-time job which will help them gain work experience and benefit their future job hunting. What's more, part-time job do offer us opportunities to use what we learn into practice and even go beyond what we are taught in class. For me, what we need to do is to try our best to make a perfect balance between working time and study time. College offer us the stage of study as well as part-time job offer us the stage of practice. If we take a good knowledge of that point, we will surely gain great achievement in our colorful college life.",CHN
"Nowadays, many college students take part time jobs during their leisure time. While the others prefer enjoy their time by entertaining or learning something new. Up to me, it doesn't matter whether one takes a part time job or not as long as he enjoys his life. He who takes part time jobs can gain working experience and earn some money. And maybe the working experience will help him find a better job in the future. But I think whether he likes the job is the most important thing. If he enjoys doing the job, it will be worthwhile. And if he doesn't, he will keep complaining and gain nothing for the job. However, if someone is really poor and short of money, it will be necessary for him to take a part time job to live on. And to those who don't take part time jobs, they can do whatever they like during their leisure time. Unless they lose their way, they can also learn a lot and enjoy their lives. I think enjoying life is most important to almost everyone, more time for one's own hobbies may be enjoyable. In conclusion, what counts isn't whether taking a part time job but whether you enjoy it. A part time job can make one's life colorful, but it can also make it boring.",CHN
"Nowadays, more and more students took part in some part time jobs. Some of my friends also took some part time jobs during the last summer after the college entrance exam. However, in my opinion, taking part time jobs is really not a brilliant idea. First of all, some kind of part time job is really a waste of time. For example, one of my friends who was accepted by a famous university decided to send leaflet during her part time. But as I think, no matter what happened, I really don't believe that a person graduated from that kind of school would have another chance to send leaflet. So he is just wasting his time. And someone would say that except for this kind of part time job, Other kind of part time job might be a kind of exercise. Unfortunately, I disagree with it either. As a student, the most important thing for us is studying. No matter how much part time job you did, the most important thing is still your studying skills. And another thing is, it can release the pressure of their family. I think, for some students whose parents are not as rich as others', this might be a way. But it's just a way, not a perfect way. Not to mention those who can afford the cost of college. After all, as I just said, you have to put your studying time into pieces to participate some part time jobs. It will certainly affect your studying. So for those whose parents can afford their college life, I think it's better toyou're your mind in studying to make more money for your parents and yourself. So I think this is it, my opinion of part time jobs.",CHN
"I agree with this statement. I have four reasons. Firstly, as I have a part-time job, I could know the importance of money. Before I entered the university, I had been given money by parents every month and had wasted so much money. But after entering the university, I haven't been given money by parents and I came to play a lot. So I began to have a part-time job and I learned importance of earning money. Secondly, it is because that I think a part-time job is a step to join to society. When we take work, we must be polite for older people. But I am not used to behaving politely so I think I can acquire courtesy through a part-time job. Also, we may find what we want to do through a part-time job. I belong to business faculty, but I am interested in education while I work in cram school. Finally, it is because we can spend college life regularly. We are likely to be lazy during long vacation such as summer vacation, winter vacation, spring vacation and golden week. But we must go the place of part-time job before decided time, so we aren't likely to be lazy. Conclusion is that I agree with the statement that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.",JPN
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First of all, smoking is very harmful. It harms not only people who are smoking but also people who are near smokers. Its smoke smells bad and most non-smokers, including me, do not like the smell of smoke. When they are eating at restaurants, I think that the smell will prevent them from enjoying eating lunch or dinner. So I disagree with smoking at restaurants. Second, I feel that the habit of smoking should be stopped. Smokers pay a lot of money to buy cigarettes and make their health so bad. They may get cancer or other health problems if they continue to smoke. It is a very strange habit and I cannot understand it. Banning smoking at restaurants may help to quit smoking. This is the second reason. It is true that there are still many smokers in Japan. However, in order to have a nice time for all people at restaurants, smoking there should be completely banned. I hope that some day smoking will be banned at all shops or public spaces and the habit of smoking will disappear from Japan.",JPN
"I think it is important for college students to have part time job. Of course, for college students, to study hard is very important, but I think there is another important things. First, this is because we can learn how hard it is to earn money. When we go shopping with friends, we usually find what we want. If we bought it with money our parents gave us, we couldn't know the value of it. By buying with money we earned, we can learn the importance of money. Second, we can contact with many types of people. In this world, a lot of people are living. But we can't meet most of them. Having a part time job gives us more opportunities to contact with people who are unknown for us, for example, employers, part time workers and consumers. Then, we can develop the skill to communicate with other people. Third, we can help our family. Until high school students, our parents had given us some money for buying something having meal or somewhere. But if we come to do these things by using the money we earned, this reduces the burden of our parents. And not only we but also they can buy what they want and eat more delicious meal. So I agree with this opinion.",JPN
"I agree students to have a part-time job. I have no part-time job now, but I had it three months ago. However I earned a little money, I could bought things I need when I was having it. But I am depending on money sending from my parents now. I feel so sorry for them, because I think I can't live by myself. Of course I don't think I can get enough money for my school life by part-time job. I need helps from my parents or school. But some money helps my parents' money, I believe. However, I don't agree with doing part-time jobs too hard. I am sometimes hearing friends' talk, I can't have time to study to do part-time job. I think it is wrong for our work, studying. We are going to school to study. We do not go to school to use money that earn by part-time job completely. So I think it is good to have a part-time job if there is some time we can use freely. When we do some part-time jobs, we can learn manners, behaviors, and many things we have to do in society. It is important for students to select their jobs.",JPN
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We should do a lot of things in our life as many as possible. When we are college students, we have free time very much. So we have chance to do a lot of things. We should have a part-time job even if only one because it teach us the importance of earning and working for people. My parents send me money now, so I do not know the importance of earning and working for people. If I would not work until graduating *** University and I would start to work not as student, what happened to me? I think I could not go well in the company and the society because I do not know the importance of earning and working for people. And a part-time job teaches us that it is hard and difficult to work to get money. No matter how hard we work for an hour, we often get 800 yen or so. Probably we think ONLY 800! I think, when we understand those importance, we will know appreciate my parents as Thanks to my parents working hard, I can go to *** University and learn. That may be most importance of having a part-time job.",JPN
". I disagree because training is needed to do any jobs properly. Training requires time and is costly in terms of economic resources. To spend time and other resources to train a worker who is doing it on a temporary basis with no guarantee on his pursuit of the same job later in his life is a complete waste of time and resources. Any part time job creates a distraction for the student. Students should focus on their studies. University studies lay the foundation for a successful career later in life. In certain cases a part time job may force a student to forgo a class or it may make him physically tired. Any forms of exhaustion interferes with the academic ability and ultimately the success of students. Furthermore, the concept of offering jobs to students should be weighed very carefully especially in this economic crisis, against job possibilities for other people in the general economy. There are many full time workers, middle aged people, married couples and even elderly people who are heavily in debt, severely short of any income and out of jobs who need some income just to meet the very basic needs and to cover expenses of the daily life. Jobs should be offered to the groups who are more in need rather than students who may not be so disparate for an income.",ENS
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country and there are some reasons. Firstly, by prohibiting smoking in public places, we can prevent second-hand smoking. Scientifically, second hand smoking could be more harmful than normal smoking. Because cigarette smoke in the air is pure toxic, so non-smokers can breathe 100% toxicity. It is serious violent that smokers do not recognized. Secondly, banning smoking in public spaces can decrease smokers-rate in the countries. By making smokers pay the fine if they smoke in the public spaces, smoker rate might be decreased. It will be more effective than government advertisement on the cigarette package. Decreasing smoker rate is not personal health related, it is national health related matter. Government should consider banning smoking in the public spaces. Many smokers will say smoking is their right. Of course they are right but they should keep others right to breathe clean air before they insist their rights. Even though cigarette is full of taxes and it is money source of government, annually government and ministry of health wasting heaps of money on advertising stop-smoking. Why do we spend al lot of money on this useless argumentation? We have already very simple and obvious answer. Stop smoking right now.",KOR
"It is very popular habit through out the world. People of every corner of the world like it, smoke it and even chew it. Even men, women and even children are addicted to it. The history of smoking was started as early as 5000 BC in shamanistic rituals. With the arrivals of the Europeans in the 16th century, the consumption, cultivation, and trading of tobacco was quickly spread. Tobacco is most commonly used for smoking. It is smoked, inhaled and even chewed. Initially it was used for medical purposes in the form of hookah. For gas troubling patients, Doctor suggest them hookah. But the passage of time it spread and the other people also strat using it in the form of cigarette Smoking has many dangerous effects on human health. It produce different disease in the smoker such as heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). Cigarette smoking is also the number one cause of bladder cancer. It is said that daily about 3, 900 kids between the ages 12 and 17 start smoking. The number of smokers is increasing daily due to large advertisement by cigarette producing companies. The world Health organization (WHO) should took step of it and should banned on all cigarette producing companies.",PAK
"I disagree with the statement. Although I am not a smoker, I have friends who are smokers and I empathize with their situation in Singapore, where there are many areas that are out of bounds to smokers. There are even fines if one smokes at bus stops or in other non-smoking areas. Smoking in restaurants can affect many diners, especially if the smoke ""interferes' with their consumption of food. I do agree that it can be uncomfortable for diners and perhaps even irritating. However, I argue that to completely ban smoking in all restaurants is unfair to smokers. There should be a smoking corner or a smoking room instead, which can greatly help smokers take a break and relax in between their meal times. This will definitely be more appreciated than to ban smoking in restaurants entirely. It also infringes on their right and freedom to smoke, which is ironical, especially in a country that promotes freedom and equality. Should the government want to completely ban smoking in a particular area, then why do they even allow the sale of cigarettes in the first place? It is this irony that exists in public places that create confusion and conflict among people, and smokers in particular. ",SIN
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons to think so. First, we can get money to have a part-time job. In college, the number of students who live alone is larger than in high school or in junior high school. We can get some money from our parents, but it is not enough. We must pay lental house charge, light charge, gus charge and water charge. We also have to pay breakfast, lunch, dinner and so on. In addition to this charge, we need to have clubs or play with friends. So, it is not enough for us to get money from our parents. It is necessary for us to get money. Second, we need to learn what job is to do a part-time job. College students have more time than high school students. It is very efficient to do a part-time job in that time. We will be social people after graduate college. We learn what society or social people is before we will be them to some degree. For example, how to communicate with other people, boss, and costomer, how to deal with my mistakes and so on. In there, we can get some skills which we can not get in school. So, it is important for us to learn what jobs is and what society is to some degree. So I think that to have a part-time job is very important for college students.",JPN
"There is a general debate nowadays about the positive and negative influence of smoking in public place. Of course, people's perspectives diverge considerably. As for me, I am inclined to the view that one shouldn't smoke in the public. Among countless factors which contribute to my position are the following conspicuous ones. First of all, smoking by itself can pose a probably and potential threat on one's health and smoking in public place not only be bad for smoker's health, but also adversely affect other people's health. According to a survey published on SCIENCE, the second smokers, breathing the smoke indirectly, suffer the higher risks than the smokers Furthermore, smoking in the public will definitely undermine the interpersonal ship, and it can probably lead to other's resentment. Secondly, smoking in the public will increase the risk of fire hazard. Most of the smoker invariably ignore to extinguish the cigar, throwing the alight stub without caution. When the stub contacts some inflammable substance, it can probably lead to a fire hazard. This can be aptly exemplified and illustrated by the case of a fire accident in CHANGSHANG PARK. A man who forgot to put out his cigar thrown it casually, but it was out of his imagination that this behavior brought about a big fire in this park, and as a consequence, various trees disappeared in this accident and the loss can not be estimated. All in all, the disadvantage of smoking in the public overshadowed the advantage of it. so I reinforce my standpoint that smoking in the public shouldn't be allowed.",CHN
"Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is a bad habit. It is full of harmful effects and affects the individual by causing illness such as cancer and lung problems. By allowing smoking at restaurant, smokers have less of reason to not smoke and there is a higher probability and a tendency for them to take a stick. This leads to more health problems for the smoker and therefore is indirectly causing harm to the individual. Secondly, there is also the possibility of second hand smoke whereby innocent consumers at the restaurants will be exposed to the harmful effects of smoking when they are not smoking themselves. This is because the harmful smoke from smoking can spread to another place and in this case another whereby other consumers are sitting. Therefore, they are breathing in the second hand smoke. This leads to harmful impacts to their body. However, there is a benefit of allowing smoking in restaurant. For certain hardcore smokers who can't live without smoking, they will eventually still find places to smoke. Therefore by banning smoking, these people will just find another place to smoke. This may instead lead to a decrease in people eating at the restaurant and hence a decrease in the revenue earned. There will be less profits and in some cases, the restaurant might even have a loss. They may have to retrench some workers and there may be social impacts that result from an increase in unemployment rate. Hence, in conclusion, banning smoking has its benefits and adverse effects. However, the adverse effects outweigh the benefits since benefits are very limiting. The smokers eventually will still have to obtain food and perhaps go to restaurant to eat eventually. ",SIN

"Balancing school and work is the hardest job a part-time worker college student has to face everyday. It may be ridiculous for some that a college student will go to work after school but for some, everything depends on these part-time jobs. Truthfully, the world is becoming inhuman. Putting money first before human lives is becoming typical. The same goes for college students working their lives off while studying at the same time. They spend 4-6 hours after school in their own respective part-time jobs. It is a common trend in today's world. To achieve a decent life and a prosperous future, one should acquire a suitable amount of money for a good education. Making money while in college is ideal for students. It becomes a priority for most students to get a part-time job to support their own studies. A working student drains the energy allotted for studying at work and sadly, not all companies or business establishments give considerations for these unfortunate students. Examples of these considerations are giving a flexible schedule and/or awarding a good salary for working students. If administered properly, part-time jobs can be an advantage for college students. It is all about the experience of working even before graduating. Some employers would love to hire fresh graduates who undergo deeper job training through part-time jobs in their college years. There is also a possibility that part-time jobs can also help college students in maintaining a healthy social life even under the heavy pressure of their studies through having both college friends and co-workers. A part-time job plays an important role to most college students nowadays. Even though some may not be in need of money, it is an essential experience that is worth all the hardships.

"Smoking in restraints should be banned completely in Japan. There are three reasons why I think so. First, it's for people who don't smoke. The smoke from the top of the cigarettes is more harmful than that which goes into smoker. So, No matter how careful people make minds not to smoke, the risk of cancer doesn't decrease. Why do we have to suffer from the risk? I can't understand. Secondly, it's for people who manage the restraints. The smoke from cigarettes contains factors which cause troubles in the restraints. The white wall turns brown gradually and the color of the wall makes the restraint's impression bad. Managers have to pay money to change wallpaper. The smoke also damages machines like air conditioner or air cleaner. The damaged filter in the machine is no longer available. Thirdly, the most important reason, it's for people who smoke heavily. As you can see, smokers should stop smoking and some people try to do it. But it is so difficult once he/she start to smoke. So we have to support them to make society comfortable for the people who want to stop smoking. As the activity, it's necessary to ban smoking and stop smoker thinking I want to smoke.",JPN
"I can't agree. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in the restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is an unfair event. Although smoking is not an illegal behavior, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in the restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer from financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment I discovered someone smoking. So, I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But, the staff said that the smokers had the rights of smoking there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry then. Luckily there have been laws to restrain the smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should be set up even earlier.",TWN
"A rising and common concern amongst college students nowadays is getting employed into a good company, especially with the increase in competition and demand. They find themselves mostly under qualified for the job they aspire, and so they resort to part-time jobs. Part-time jobs, not only do they give students a background in the work environment or OJT (on-the-job training), but also consume only a small amount of their time, allowing them to still be able to focus on their academics. In my opinion, part-time jobs are not required, but highly recommended for any college student. The working experience comes in handy when it comes to entering a professional working atmosphere or a similar job. As an accounting student, I volunteered myself to get summer and part-time jobs at a real estate firm. Though my occupation may not necessarily align with my future aspirations, the learning experience I gain is extremely helpful. It has not only taught me how things are supposed to be inside an office, but also the flow of work, the sense of professionalism, and the dedication to work. Basing it mostly from subjective input, I do highly recommend and agree that college students have part-time jobs.",PHL
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Last year, I became a college student. And I knew that college students have a lot of time because their school hours are shorter than that of high school students. That's why a lot of people join club activity or circle activity. And some people who are interested in foreign country go abroad for the purpose of language study or specialty study. Naturally, club activity, circle activity, and studying abroad need not only long free time but also need a lot of money. Students may get money from parents, but I think that they should get money by themselves because they are not just children. The reason why I recommend a part-timer of a college student is that not only a reason that it merely becomes an income source but also it can become good experience for their future. For example, when I worked in restaurants, I must learn that I try to always behave to a visitor in a polite manner. And when I work as a part-timer of a lecturer in a private supplementary school, I must learn a way to teach things intelligibly. So that there are two reasons such as the above, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN

" Part time job is becoming more and more popular. Many college students take part time jobs to get money to pay for the university or get some work experience. I think, part job is necessary for university students. First, part time job, in my opinion, is not just a way for money, it is a way to get work experience and learn about the society. Today, employees want not just your high grades, but also your work experience. Suppose that there are two persons wanting a job, one has a two-year part time job experience and the other has never worked for others before, the employee is sure to hire the former. So, part time job will help you find a better full time job. Second, part time job is also a way to get money. In the past, it is our parents who pay for us, but now we have grown up. It is responsible for us to make money ourselves to help our parents. I think parents will be happy to see that we can make a live by ourselves. Third, taking a part time job can help us make some friends of all kinds. Today, friends can help you a lot. They can give you good advice or they can help you when you get trouble. Part time job will let you know a lot of workmates, and they maybe your friends. From all above, we can see that a part time job is really necessary for college students. Some of my classmates have already taken part time jobs. So, find a part time job for yourself, it will help you a lot!",CHN
"When I was young, I was told by my teacher that for a student, it's more important to learn study-ability than learning knowledge. However, my teacher never pointed out the way of learning study-ability, he only teach us how to win the knowledge competition as other teachers, even he knew the importance of the study-ability. I think Chinese students were just like eggs lived in a tremendous protection system before they stepped into university. College students were better, they were more independent, analytical and original, but still were newborn chicken with a piece eggshell. This was a result of many factors, but that's not my focal point, I wanted to focus on how to help college students get rid of the last eggshell. Actually, the answer always was not unique, hundreds people had thousands ways to make them more mature. For most college students, having a part time job was a wise and effective way to get rid of the last eggshell, to make up the defect of growing up by the over protection system. Having a part time job gave you incentive of working hard because you earned from it ; Having a part time job enriched your college life ; Having a part time job made you more sociable and learned more life experience from it...... Actually I can list a lot of benefits of having a part time job for a college student. But we should notice clearly that the central theme was not how much money you earned, how many friends you made, was the ability you learned from the part-time job, was the ability of studying, was the ability of independence, that's the most important!",CHN
"Nowadays, the commerce in many countries is bad that it can cause for many reasons such as politic, business, international contacts, education, occupations and so on. This affects college students directly and indirectly. After this situation occur in many country, the questions come that how the government or society plane to solve this problem, or whether or not the society has a good way out to help them that they are encountering it. In my opinion, I think that the college students should have a part-time job. when students are studying in college they must spend a lot of money. Sometimes their family can not support them enough money so, if they have a part-time job to work. It is a good way for them to help their family save money, too. Base on above issue, I strongly agree that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Otherwise, the college students will be able make moneys to support their study and sometimes their family. The part time job is a good teacher for them to learn about experience in working and adapt themselves in other people. Also, they will know new friends and can share their opinion, too.",THA
"Smoking is one of the hobbies of many people. They said smoking can forget their problems. But for me its not. They also said that if you smoke you are being social. Smoking is not good in our health. It can harm our internal organs such as heart and lungs. For me it is only for fun and hobby. The statement smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, I agree. Because first of all restaurants is a place that we eat our food. We know that it is a public place. But if you smoke there, the smoke that came from the cigarette will harm the food and people around you. For example in a restaurant. My friend is eating in a simple restaurant. The man who sited beside her smoke. While she is eating she felt that there is something smells bad. Then she found out that the guy is smoking. She called the attention of the manager of the restaurant and told to him that they must banned cigarette smoking because some of its toxins may come to the food that we eat. We can be sick because of that. Most of the restaurants are in air conditioned, so if someone will smoke, the customers who are eating there can suffocate.",PHL

Smog for smoking in restaurants annoy people. smoking doesn't eat it's bad. Smoking is drugs. Smoking is problems. Smog for smoking destroy air, example oxygen gas. And smoking is spend more money. But doesn't benefit. Government spend more money, take care people is smoking. And restaurants spend money, does area for customer smoking. Maybe some customer does not impressed about smog for smoking. So banned all restaurants reduce smog. And less people's smoking. Less disease for smoking. People's disease respiration, cancer in lung, cancer in liver less. And people stop smoking. So government to economical expenditure to take care patient for smoking. Banned at all smoking in restaurant is safety. Because protect people does not smoking. They are not dangerous. Children in restaurants are not dangerous. Restaurants is more impress. And smog for smoking have substances dangerous. It's to detract lung and dangerous to respiration. And important smoking is dangerous to people smoke. The second dangerous is people around you.",THA
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as it entails many benefits. These benefits include vocational experience, financial independence, and practicing time management. Such benefits are useful immediately upon graduation and for the rest of their lives. Firstly, part-time jobs bring about vocational experience to prepare college students for the workforce, where they will experience how it is like to work in different environments. They will also gain technical skills and experience for the particular vocation they are working at, which could be useful in their future employment or personal lives. Secondly, a part-time job might allow college students to be financially independent to some extent, in which they support themselves through college using their earnings. Consequently, college students would also learn to manage their finances, as they would have to set aside money for their education, personal expenses, and savings. Even if their earnings are not enough to cover the cost of their education, it would allow them to repay their tuition loans earlier or offset more expenses. Thus, students need not be in debt after their education or being entirely reliant on financing. Lastly, part-time jobs would necessarily help a college student pick up time-management skills as they would have to juggle both their education and their job. This could be disruptive in the short term, but if the student is able to juggle both effectively, he or she would be much more productive, and less likely to be sidetracked by distractions common in college life. In conclusion, part-time jobs would be beneficial to college students in a myriad of ways, allowing them to pick up soft skills while financing themselves for the later part of their lives. ",SIN
"There are many part time jobs. Every student has worked a part time job at least once for making their pocket money or any reasons. These days it is very difficult to get a job more and more in our current society. I think the part time job is helpful to us and our future. Because we can save money by making money for ourselves. My parents said people can know the value of money when they make money for themselves. In my case, I understand my parents' saying although I have not worked many part time jobs until now. For our future, we can have a social experience in advance before we get a full-time job. We meet many people through the part time job so, we can find our aptitude. We can know ourselves better and decide our future job. Therefore, the part time job can be a first-step for starting our real goal and we can experience many things that are bad or good in a part of our life. The more we work a part time job, the more we get many experiences and make much money. The part time job has a variety of merits.",KOR
"Smoking in public places is immoral and even illegal in some cities. So I can see it's harmful to us. This kind of action must be stopped. Some eldership doesn't think highly of its harm, so they just carry on smoking in public places. Smoking is normal and necessary when meeting some old friends or relatives to them. Smoking helps them feel more relaxed and comfort. And some teenagers also smoke in public places. To them, smoking is cool; so they smoke to draw other's attention. People referred to above are selfish and foolish, they never think about other's and themselves' health. So I can't agree to their action. Knowing smoking in public places is harmful to others and themselves, why are there still so many people do like this? Smoking has become cultural in China. So even I think it must be stopped, but in recent years keeping the status in quo is somewhat acceptable. People must try to stop it and decrease this action. In the end, I manna to say that if anyone want him and his family to live longer and healthier, he just have to stop smoking in public places. Anyhow, smoking in public places is acceptable now; but it will disappear from china in the future.",CHN
"Agree with that should not be smoking in restaurants around the country because the restaurant is a restaurant for dining. A public restaurant to anyone who does not supposed to smoke inside the restaurant. The bad will happen, it does not happen, but with male smoking only But it will affect the people around inside the cylinder with the people. The opinion that smoking in restaurants. But the disadvantages that both the internal and external The image of social outsiders look. The impact that followed. The owner should be made no-smoking signs in restaurants or public places. Smoking is not allowed to see the sign prominently or a restaurant owner should be prepared places for smokers to sit it. It would be better for him be smoke in restaurant. A good government should be a law banning smoking in restaurants or public places that should be advertising to the negative effects of smoking and the distribution more pronounced. And there should be more stringent penalties than ever. To the environment in general society and individuals will be happier to see people smoking, quit smoking. All people who don't smoke will be happy too that they don't smell tobacco and don't get hurt from smoking.",THA
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Since smoking causes not only us but also around people bad condition. In this society, it is easy for us to feel that Smoking people is separated from not smoking people. The smell of tobacco is not good. I am caught a serious illness by harmful substances containing it. From one experiment, we find that people who breathe in the smell of tobacco by smoking people live shorter than other people. So, smoking influence many people who is not only smoking people but also not smoking people. In fact, smoking is banned in the station, in the train, in the office, in the hospital, and so on. All of these places are common places. People who want to smoke have to move smoking room. Restaurant is one of the common places. Many children and adult people come to restaurant to eat lunch. Can you smoke in front of these people? What you smoke in the restaurant may cause them some illness. I think we should spread this statement all over the world. To protect people who enjoy eating lunch in the restaurant from the smell of tobacco in smoking.",JPN
"In front of each building, so many people smoke cigarette. Some people said when they smoke cigarette; they feel free and can rest easily between work times. However, I think it's not a suitable way to prove their behaviors. No matter how they feel, it's really harmful way everybody including none smoking cigarette. So I want to insist that we should prohibit smoking cigarette with several reason. First, if someone smoke cigarette next to others, they couldn't avoid potential dangers. We always advice smoking people that their children, family could leave with potential harmful situation. their family could have lung cancer, and could get some disease in respiration organs. For own family, smoking people always think of smoking cigarette. Second, when someone smoke cigarette, they couldn't easily stop smoking because of addicting symptom. According to several researches, when smoking people stop smoking, they could shake their hand or get weight suddenly. Also, they think that they could do anything without smoking; however, their thought is perfectly wrong. If they continuously smoke cigarette, they would get mental and physical disease compared to none smoker. I totally agree that government make cigarette price higher in cigarette market. If it spontaneously make smoking people decrease, cigarette market have to get more tax and Fix price products higher.",KOR
"I don't believe that legislation is the best way to ban smoking in restaurants. It really is a case of supply and demand, which private markets already represent. Having said that, private agreements will always impact on others in both a positive and negative fashion. In the case of cigarettes, they of course are having a negative impact as the market tastes have changed which means that they either have ill effects on others or have fallen out of favor for any number of reasons. For example, when people smoke in public places or restaurants, there is no doubt that they pollute the air and are a threat to the health of other customer's health. From that point onwards, the market changes and the law of supply and demand takes control of the situation. Less people will go to smoking restaurants causing the market to drop. Now that is an over-simplified marketing example but it describes the situation in a nutshell. If we dig a little deeper however, despite the fact that governments have introduced anti-smoking education, the number of adults and young people smoking, is surprisingly large. This means that the addiction for these smokers is not just drugs but in fact a deeper emotional attachment which means that it is harder to break and no ban in the world will prevent them from getting their fix.",ENS
"I agree. The reason for this is. First, it is their personal reason. I felt university student is so much time. But they didn't use their time. They consume time on play. And they not managed time well. That is they waste of time. Second, university student is spending a lot of money. Need a lot of money, but Allowance is a fixed, Expenditure is more than allowance. University student is not minor. So themselves need to be managed, Must take responsibility for their actions. If you need anything more than that It should buy their earned. I have also acted. Third, it is opportunity to Social experience in advance. Entered the University, after graduating from high school, the first experience Social Life is so difficult. However as experience is more understand in community. So am I, working part-time job social life is difficult, and I felt that it is difficult to make money. On the other hand I felt making money is fun. And I felt Interested in work. So part-time job is not must do, but I think it is maybe a little need? In my experience, part time job is feeling the importance of money. And it will save you money. This is our proverb same. No pain, no gain.",KOR

No relaxation will not feel uncomfortable to live the consequences is. Mental bad. Body is not strong. And stress.

"It is extremely important for college students to have a part-time job. It teaches us to be responsible and it also teaches us the real value of money, but more than that, I think college student should have a part-time job so that they can learn to be real adults and stop depending on their parents so much. I have been working part time since I was only 12 years old, so I have no sympathy for some of my friends whose parents seem to have done everything for them. Now, some of my friends think that it is unfair that they don't have extra spending money because their parents stopped giving it to them, but I think they should just did a part-time job and do something for themselves for once. Next, a part-time job is a great way to get used to working in the real world. Some college students just have work study jobs, but these are very different from what they will experience once they graduate from college. Therefore, I think it is good to get a real part-time job at a real company not affiliated with the school as soon as possible both in order to make some extra pocket money as well as to start conditioning yourself for a real career.",ENS
"I don't agree that college students work part time. It is because two reason. In the first place, college students have to study hard. Once, they studied hard to entrance examination. Why they wanted to pass the entrance exam? It is they wanted to translate dreams into a reality. So if they want to do that still now, they have to continue studying even now. But they can't study hard if they work part time. They can't study hard because they can't take time to do so. If they work part time hard, he can't study and they fail them test. In the second place, part time job make some money. You know it is a little money, but it is a lot of money for college students. Most of college students spend money on pleasure and their hobby. Only a part of students saves money. If you spend all your money, you will have nothing. I think that young people should give themselves up to sports, studying, or club activities. Surely, money is important in our life, but it is not everything. You should not always work part time, or your heat will be satisfied. That's whyâ… don't agree that college students work part time.",JPN
"First of all I would like to explain the definition of part time job. The part time job is such type of work or job which we perform in a spare time. There are several advantages and disadvantages of the part time job. First I would like to explain the advantages of part time job. The part time job is very important for best spending time that time in which we go to bad companies and that time which we destroy in devilish ways, through performing such work we can secure him self from these wrong ways. And the second advantage is that in this case we are earning money and we are aware of the importance of money to use in a good way instead of adopting bad ways of spending money. And the third way is that the part job holder can face the whole problem of life before to happen such sort of circumstance. Part time job holder also can take the burden of his spending from his family. The final advantage of part time job is that the part time job holder feels independence, he is not dependent upon his family we can also give name self employed person. And the demerits of the part time job is during the taking part time job there is a wastage of the time and even then if a student do the part time job he can not concentrate on his study. In this way the part time job creates a bad impact on our society.",PAK
"Smoking is one of bad habits of humans. It causes many of diseases. And makes bad personality. But it's rooted in every society since former times such as Indian smoked to proof their brotherhoods. In nowadays you still see many people smoking in public places such as university, park, mall, on footpath, even in restaurant. So should it be ban? It's hard to say. But in my opinion some places should be not allow for smoking. In this case, smoking in the restaurants should be ban. Because of the restaurant is place that people come to eat happily not to come and sniff cigarette's smoke. They should come to eat nutrients not diseases. As I told at first smoking cause bad personality and disease such as lunge cancer or bad breath. But all of permission to allow or not allow for smoking is upon to each restaurant. If they give the permission to not allow to smoke in their restaurant may be they lose their smoker customers. But if they allow to smoke in their restaurant may be they lose other non-smoker customers. It's all about profits. Even though, we can't order the restaurants or people who smoke to not smoke in the public places. But we can zoning for smoking areas. Or teach our children for bad of smoking. And we can raise them to be adults who don't smoke.",THA

It brings polution, it can make global warming, it can be waste and it can be caused many diseases. I think the government must to make arrangement with good punish. A government must be banned smoking in the public area. Such as, restaurant, halte bus, airport, station and the other public place. Restaurant is important place that don't permit to smoke. Restaurant is the place where many kind of food. Except that, there are many people and children that visit there. The place use air conditioner. So, that will be dangerous if someone smoking. The air is in the place will be mixed with gas that very dangerous. Smoking can make polution for food. So, smoking must be banned in the public place especially restaurant.

Mostly elders opinion is that if somebody saved his mind in college life they saved their mind in whole life. job after class will be very helpful for students to save their selves to go to on wrong way. All bad habits comes if a person will free and have spare time to serve upon them. so when a student serve his whole day in any work so he will never suffer in any bad habit and never go to any wrong side. Another profit of part time job is that a student can become responsible or self dependent or a person can become punctual. With the help of job they will feel their responsibility of his duty. Fulfil orders of their bosses and complete their all duty work will helpful for them to become responsible. By fulfill office work or responsibilities they will start to realize their real life responsibilities or become mature.

"What do you think about smoking in the public places? I think it should not be allowed. Refer to many years researching, the result that; almost of the people think negative about it. Do you know? More than 80% of the restaurants in Thailand have been banned the smoking and if anyone smokes they will be fined for 2, 000 baht. But in the past time, smoking has been allowed for every restaurant, pub and club. That was very uncomfortable for the people who are a non-smoking person. They would inhale the smoke and get it more than the smokers. Right now there are the ways to solve this problem, the first one is fine and the second is set the smoking zone in the public places and restaurants so far from everyone. Smoke, there are many toxic and disadvantage, that is the good idea to protect ourselves from that. I'm very sure that you want to be happy when you have a dinner with a fresh air without smoke, smell bad and toxic.

Here is a lot of reason that students have part time job. First, the part time job experience is going to learn sociability that meets many people. Because many part time job meet people in these days. So sociability is very important. Many customers like to have high social skill worker. Therefore many employers choose to have social skill employee. Second, the part time job is going to earn much money. Many students received pocket money by parent.

"In these years, the Japanese government has recommended politics which smokers bother where they smoke calmly. For example, the government made streets nobody can walk or stay with smoking. We got cities clean and enjoy walking comfortably. Most people translate it as a very attractive policy. So, all the restaurants in the country should completely banned smoking too. We can especially find many bad situations in the restaurant. Their smoke makes not only them but also non-smoking customers more tasteless. If non-smoker were sitting far from smokers, they could not avoid smoke coming up. Then, passive smoking is a great important problem. As you know, smoking does damage smoker's lugs and it leads smokers to have various bad diseases. Moreover, those diseases have a possibility to affect health of non-smokers who breathe smoke surrounding them. Smoke is more dangerous than we usually consider. Actually, smokers have troubled non-smokers while it is unknown. The restaurant's floor is restricted within a narrow space. And customers sometimes turn up to eat with little children. So, all people at the restaurant are should be more attention to smoking. In Japan, most people have seen smoking in any appearances in a new light.

"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons. It takes a long time for us to realize the importance of having a part-time job for college students. In fact, having a part-time job has a lot of advantages. First of all, finding a part-time job is a good way to improve students' practical abilities. Take a friend of mine for example, he took a part-time job as a food deliver during the summer vacation time. He told me that he had been more patient after he took that job and he thought that he has improved his skills in society. In addition, finding a part-time job can make your life diverse. You will feel a sense of alive and you will find that life is more interesting. But today's students don't like part-time job. They think it is a kind of waste of time. What's more, some of students say that they can't near the cruelty of society. In fact, disadvantages exist. But all in all, having a part-time job is a kind of practice for college students. It can be training before we enter the real society and it can help us improving our skills.",CHN
"I don't think that part-time work is important for college students. I also don't think that work is important for adults. We were put here on this earth to serve and worship the Lord Jesus Christ, and everything that gets in the way of that is just a waste of time. It is only a matter of time until he comes back to save all of us, and the people who have been frittering away their time an ungodly pursuits will not ascend to heaven. This is what I was taught to believe. But since I have come to college, I have learned that some of the things that my family taught me may have been wrong. The more I learn in college the more I have come to realize that whether are not you are a religious person, you do have time you're on the earth, and you have to use that time to do good things. I think that if you do that, then you can go to heaven any ways. It has taken a long time for me to learn about this, and has taken a long time for me to shake the bonds of my religious upbringing.

"When teenagers were high school students, they have less responsibility, less self-dependency, and they are still living in their comfort zone. Therefore, as soon as they step into college life, they have stepped into adulthood as well. As an adult, they have to be independent, able to take care of themselves, and take bigger responsibility for their own life. That is why college students should have a part time job. There are three reasons why they should have a part time job; to learn to not be dependent on one's parents, to be able to work, and to learn to have their responsibility as an adult. First of all, by taking a part time job, high school students who just turned into college students can be independent and learn to not lean on their parents anymore since they will part from them later on. Second, by taking a part time job, they can learn about working and earning money. Although part time job is a small job, but it can give them a picture of how working world is and how they make a living through it so that later when they are working in a company or starting their own business, they already know how to adapt and what to do. Lastly, through the part time job, they can learn on how to be responsible to themselves, by doing their work properly, and to others who are related to the part time job, the costumers, the managers, and co-workers. That is why college students should take a part time job.",IDN
"One of the main financial sources of college students, part time job has its pros and cons. As advantages, first, part time job helps students earn some extra money to support their tuition and daily expense, especially when there are more and more families influenced by economic depression. Second, even if their families are well off, the students could gain a higher sense of independency through being more responsible for their own needs, which may also make them more thankful toward their hard-working parents. Third, part time job may provide some early experiences of careers and society, and could also help establishing the networking which may benefit the students' lives in a near future when they begin their businesses. On the other hand, part time job has several negative influences on students, too. The primary one is that having a part time job usually eats up the time that students may need for their genuine task: studying. It would be a pity if a student turns out to sacrifice learning for a waiter job which pays only 100 NTD per hour, since the former is often more valuable as an investigation of the future. Another disadvantage is the risk of being confronted with bad employers who mean to trick innocent students. Some may cut down the salary for a variety of reasons; some may commit sexual harassment or even rape, taking advantages of students who dare not to condemn the boss. In short, part time job should be carefully considered when students usually focus more on the positive side of the thing.",TWN
"It is very easy to acquire bad habits. The more we do a thing the more we like doing. And if we don't continue doing it we feel unhappy. This is called the force of habit.

Tobacco is now smoked are chewed by men or also by women and even by children, all the world over. It is brought into Europe in to America by Sir Walter religh four centuries ago and has since then spread every where. Latest researches now tells us that there is no good in this habit even when tobacco is not used to excess; and unfortunately it is very difficult to get rid of this despicable habit when it is once formed. In spite of the warning of danger and the effects of smoking the number of the smoker and addicts is going on increasing. About thousands of people are set to be the addicts of it and have ruined their lives. It is an alarming situation. The smoke cigarette makes them sheepish and woeful.

"I agree with this idea. Today in many public places, smoking is banned. For example, in a station smoking places are separated by box. Most people are beginning to pay attention to smoking. So, smoking in a restaurant is not permitted. There are three reasons for this. First, smoking is very harmful not only for themselves but also for other people around them. It is true that people have freedom of smoking, but I think they should refrain it in public places. I heard that the rate of death of the people who passively smoked becomes much higher than not smoking people. Especially, it affection is dangerous for the pregnant, old and young. Second, people in the restaurant can't enjoy their meal by smoking. Most people's right to enjoy should be protected. Third, smoking itself is not bad habits, but children tend to imitate adult's habits. If many people in Japan smoked, more and more children were likely to smoke. Once men start to smoke, it is very difficult to stop smoking soon by themselves.

First, college students will take a nice job after graduation, and they know that when owners need and pick the new officer, they usually want who man has many experience to other office. Students can make experience, such as visiting other countries, working somewhere, and internship. My friend worked for a long time in one company when she was college student, and then she could get a job to there. Second, they always feel that college fee is very expensive. So they need a lot of money for college life. But they can not work for a long time and every days, Because, they are student, and students have study. Finally, they learn to the value of money. Today, we live in richness of everything. If we want to hold something or want to change such as telephones, MP, and watch, we can hold that from parents or somebody. So, we don't know the value of money. I think that if college students have a part time job, they will grow great man and will change they's life, so a part time job of college students is very important.",KOR
"I think that it is extremely important. With the economy the way it is now, students need to learn very early that the best chance at success that they have is by taking financial responsibility for themselves as soon as possible. Further, if they want to get ahead, then they also need to get as many skills and as much work experience as they can. Getting a job is not as easy as it used to be and it is very tough in New Zealand at the moment just as it is in many countries. Many companies are simply not hiring and a lot of recruitment programs have been put on hold in the larger corporations. Students also have to expect that they might not get the job that they want as soon as they graduate, but if they had some kind of work experience they would have a good chance at getting some other kind of work in the meantime. They need to be mentally tough and prepared that life might just not fall into place in the way that they expect and have a few alternative strategies rather than just one big plan to land their dream jobs.",ENS
"It is quite normal to see so many warning signs around the public, saying that smoking is banned with the maximum fine of ten thousand dollars. Being a guy who hates smoking and people who smoke, I strongly insist smoking should be banned in the restaurants in my country. According to the news and research, people who inhale the second-hand smokes would get more chances to get the lung cancer than those who smoke, so this issue has been controversially discussed and regulated. Because it has to do with people's health and rights to get healthy, I believe in the regulation of these rules. In my memory, I once had a quarrel with an old man who smokes publicly in the department store, and he was scolded to silence by me and the passer-by. In the long run, he put out the smokes and ran away with understanding the severe consequence a smoker should deserve. Recently, the complete ban to smoke has been carried out in campus around the country as well, showing that smoking in public places in not available Nowadays. Consequently, I would clap my hand and applaud for the ban of smoking in the public places, especially restaurants, and in that way everyone can enjoy the delicious food and ""healthy"" surroundings without any detriment smokes bring.",TWN
"I think that it is important for university student to do part time job. First, we can study about social things. That thing, we can not study at college. For example, we can know about difference to earn money and we save money than ever. Besides, we meet person whose age is far from us. We speak to them politely. And we rarely talk with those people that are precious experience. Second, part time job is only way to make money for me. I am not rich but I want to buy many clothes, and I want to go abroad, and I want to.. Because I want much money, I must have a part time job. And I think college students are usually the same as me. Generally, high school students can not have a part time job, and graduate of college work at office whether he or she likes it or not. That is to say, the only college student can have a part time job. So college students should not miss this chance! Third, we can develop our ability. If I work part time job at JUKU School, I learn how to teach to other person. If I do manual labor, I build up my health. Like this, we can skill up through part time job.",JPN

"Hong Kong SAR Government has enforced a ban on public venues, including restaurants, on 1 January, 2007. I welcome this implementation very much, as I agree on the ban of smoking in all restaurants. The first obvious reason is, smoking is bad for our health. It is close to common sense that smoking cause a lot of serious diseases. Many researches have also concluded when statements indicating that smoking induce cancers and raise the risk of heart diseases. Such a dangerous habit is therefore a major threat to the public health and a burden in medical health care system. Secondly, the fume from the cigarette smoke is also harmful to the non-smokers around. This is referred as """"second-hand smoking"""". Research findings leads to the fact that most of the harmful substances in the process of cigarettes burning eventually go to the atmosphere. That means the non-smokers will be the sink of the these undesirable gases. Innocent second-hand smokers, thought do not smoke, suffer a equivalent or even greater risk in developing cancers or other serious illness. Last but not least, the fume from the cigarette smoke has a bad odour. If these fumes get into the restaurants and inhaled by the diners, they will surely lose their appetite. It is hence a very inconsiderate move to allow anyone to smoke in the restaurants. In conclusion, the consequence of allow smoking in the restaurants is grave. Therefore, I oppose the idea smoking in the restaurants.",HKG
"I think that is probably important for college students to have a part-time job in college because everyone is always talking about this issue, and my parents have always strongly encouraged me to get a part-time job. I have only just entered college, and I think I would like to take a semester or two to get accustomed to the college environment before I tried to do too many things at once. If I feel that I'm able to deal with both classes and work in a manner which is acceptable to me, I will definitely pursue part time work, and at that time, my opinion will probably be that college students should always without a doubt have a part-time job. However, if I find that I do not have enough time, I will probably begin to think that it is not so important for college students to have a job. It really comes down to how well you can balance both activities, and this will vary based upon individuals. What might be too much work for me is probably a comfortable amount of work for someone else, and so our decisions would differ based on that. I think it is great that everyone can tailor their college experience to suit their own level of comfort.",ENS
"Part time job is a good way to train our children because I think that studies theory in school is not enough. They must have more experience before we release them to world of work. Parents must know that doing part time job have many advantage to their children. First, they will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship besides teacher and classmates. Second, they will more easily to find their ideal job because of their experience. Third, part time job can train them how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money, so they can more appreciate money and not carelessly spend it. Fourth, It will increase their ability to speak to public (public relation). Interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. Fifth, they can learn how to take responsibility for what they have done. Take responsibility is very important factor in our working environment too. Another reason for the urge of encouraging our children to take part time job is part time job can make them know what is the value of time. Many children spend their idle time to playing video games, computer, watch movies, etc.. With doing part time job, they can use that time to do something meaningful things. In summary, we can say that part time job is good for our children.",IDN
"Everyone knows that smoking is not a good thing. It will hurt your body, get cancers, even hurt the people you don't know, they just close to you unlucky. So the government has planned to ban smoking at all the public place, like restaurants, shopping malls and train stations. The effect is not good as it predicted. People still smoking everywhere. To protect most non-smoking people, some public places set smoking area that put smokers together. I extremely agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants, even all over the country. The reason is very simple: smoking is bad! For the health of country, we should stop making or input cigarette. I don't like the smell of smoke, and I believe that most people are the same. I don't know why the smokers started to smoke. They insist smoking though the healthy tax is heavier and heavier. And there's quite a lot of clubs promote the disease that smoking makes. Smokers still smoke. I hope them will understand how foolish they are someday. But I cannot stand smoking in the restaurant.

When I was eating my favorite dish hamburger steak, a man by our table got smoking. As the smoke came to me, I hated eating it. Because the taste of the hamburger stake mixed with smoke, I would like him to have stopped smoking. Smoke is some bad effects on our taste and smell. And it is a great damage for nonsmoking people to breathe smoke. Now in Japan, many restaurants and cafes have both smoking area and nonsmoking area. But there are a few restaurants and cafes that they have both smoking room and nonsmoking room. So smoking should be completely banned. Japanese food is loved in the world. Many foreigners come to Japan every year. They have many meals at the restaurants in Japan. Japanese food is especially a delicate food.

"Recently some researches show that smoking is not only bad to the smoker himself, but also people around him, which arouse public's attention, especially those non-smokers. Walking along the street, you can speed up and overtake who are blowing a cloud. In a taxi cabin or on a bus, you can crank the window and ventilate. However, suppose you are sitting in a restaurant, waiting your meal with expectation and a person, just sits on the next table, enjoying inspiriting and aspirating, what will you do? You feel uncomfortable, annoyed, and angry. But unfortunately you can find little to do. I have gone through such dilemma, so I strongly agree that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurant is a place where we order and enjoy palatable food. We change our money for chef's elaborate skills, exciting visual and tongue experience, even good health. Usually smoking restrains your appetite. More cigarettes, less degustation. Definitely it isn't worthy of what you have paid. It means waste of time and money. So first of all, I suggest those who prefer smoking on a table put out lighter and take up the dishware. On the other hand, since you are in a public area, you are bound to take other people into consideration. Smoking, this behavior, has a unique form â€“ smoke, which floats everywhere without boundaries and has impact on others. A smoker may claim smoking is his or her private right. If it is, they should do that in their private place like sitting room or balcony. Everybody knows smoking is bad for health, including those heavy smokers. The problem is that they have formed a habit that can be hardly gotten rid of. Banning smoking in restaurants is an option to create a harmonious situation and relationships among people. Although it seems not a positive way, I still uphold it.",CHN

"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job. First, college students need a lot of money. For example, I think we ourselves, not our parents, ought to pay our tuition fee of the college. Furthermore, if you want to join a club, you have to pay an entrance fee. If you want to go shopping with your friends, money is necessary. Second, it is true that college students are very busy studying, but in my opinion, we can cope with both studying and part-time jobs. These days, there are some part-time jobs which we can take a day off from during the test terms. Third, to have a part-time job helps you to find what you want to do in the future. There are a large number of college students who cannot decide their future plans in detail. Therefore, if you have a part-time job which you are interested in, you are able to choose the most suitable job for you after graduating from the college. For these reasons, in order to get significant campus life, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I don't have a part-time job now, but I am going to have a part-time job during the summer vacation.",JPN

I feel happy when we become smart. And I get happier when I hear thanks from my students. This is why I have become want to be a cram school teacher. And other reason for having part time job is money. We need much money for enjoy our school life.

"Speaking of the problem of smoking, I wasn't truly bothered by the secondhand smoke when I was a child. Because my father used to smoke inside the house, when I smell someone smoking around me outdoors, I can stand it. However, as I grow up, I have known that what secondhand smoke could hurt innocent people who don't smoke and surroundings as well. I started to hate selfish smokers, including my father. Then, the new policy was declear. Nobody was allowed to smoke indoors. Until this period, I can breathe in the air without strange smell, I realize I agree with this policy. However, on the one hand, some smokers said that their human rights were taken. They don't like the boundaries about where to smoke. What's more, the businessmen hate this policy, too. With the limitation, people who tried not to get the bill because of against the rule, they choose quit smoking, and that cause the sales down. On the other hand, the crowed who don't smoke think they were protected. The nightmares about those annoying smell has gone in certain places, such as restaurant. In my opinion, it is a good decision to banned smoking at restaurants, even though there some dissatisfied sounds from some group. To think in a vision way, if this policy can lead to the decrease of number of smoke people, it is their health that being blessed.",TWN
"In the case of this question, apart from issue which we need money or not, I think that it is not the most important for us to have a part-time job. But I am sure that in college life it might be important to do in some degree. Even if we need so great money, money is especially and useful to live. Therefore, there is no reason for not having a part-time job. In other opinions, to have a part-time job is practical for our experience of life. Surely, it is important to have a part-time job in order to experience a society. But, I think that in college we should make effort to learn various things. If anything, I would like to have general knowledge and expert skill through my college life, since I entered the department of applied chemistry in Technology. To be honest, it is now so difficult for me that the special knowledge of technology is very wide, deep and complicated.

"While it is absolutely true that smoking is unhealthy for both the smoker himself and the surrounding people, we have no rights to stop people smoking if this action does not affect the welfare of the general public. Nevertheless, it is not realistic to ban smoking in all the restaurants because restaurants are important places for people to socialize and relax and smoking has become a common practice during family and business gathering in certain culture. Instead, restaurants should set up separate smoking area that will allow smokers to smoke. By doing so, both smokers and non-smokers who dine at the restaurants will be satisfied. Although this seems to be the best way out for both groups of people, it does not mean that the society should encourage smoking. Smoking is not only unhealthy for the smokers, but will also bring negative externalities to the whole community. Allowing people smoking in designated area is perhaps the best way for the society to show respect and equality for each individual. Besides, to discourage people smoking in public areas, the restaurants could also choose to charge a higher price for smokers or offer cigarettes-substitutes such as candies or drinks to smokers to help them inhibit their addiction temporarily.

"Nowadays more and more people smokes. We can see people smoke almost everywhere, and they seems to enjoying the feeling of smoking very much no matter what reaction they come across when smoking. Personally I don't think it interesting or cool to smoke, because I like breathing fresh air. I simply can't understand why people feel good to smoke in some ""polluted"" air. I do know the chemical stuff that burned tobacco releases have the effect of chairing people up, but for most of smokers it is not the chemical reaction the reason that they smokes but the image of smoking people are cool and grown-up, others may be smoking because of stress from life, rare as it is, still others are truly addicted to tobacco. Money spend on cigarettes is a fortune to any body, but they spend it on cigarettes day after day, even though they can save it or do some business with it. Despite its wasting money character is not favourable, the critical point is that it do harm people's health. When you smokes, you smokes in more than the inspiring chemical; you also takes in stuff that released when tobacco burns. Imaging what it is like when a forest catches fire, you can see thick smoke comes from burned plants, and that is, just a little bigger, exactly the same kind of stuff you breath in when smoking. So, although you may say it's hard to cut off cigarettes, you'd better do cut off them for your own health and people around you.",CHN

Moreover, smoking will make people's fingers and teeth go yellow, it will affect smokers' appearance.

Effects of passive smoking are seriously worse than the original smokers since the smoke gets in their body without any filtering. Restaurants always are airtight areas, and tables are always close. If you smoke, big amount of people will be force to have passive smoke. People can choose to leave the smokers far away while both of them are outside, but they cannot choose when they are in restaurants. Moreover, smoke is easier to get in their body while they keep opening their mouth to eat.

"Smokers can be sighted almost everywhere --- at bus stops, hawker centres, or even outside shopping malls. With the increase in the number of smokers and the harmful effects of second-hand smoking, the Singapore government has thus stepped up regulatory controls on smokers. The question then arises as to whether smokers should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. To me, I believe that the welfare of society should outweigh the welfare of the individual; hence I strongly agree that there should be a complete ban on smoking at all restaurants in Singapore. Given the harmful effects of second-hand smoking, where passive smokers may end up breathing in the carcinogenic chemicals from the exhaled cigarette smoke and develop lung-related diseases, more regulatory control should be in place to protect non-smokers. As restaurants in Singapore are commonly air-conditioned, smoking in restaurants would mean that the cigarette fumes would still remain within the compound and be hard to get rid of. This not only increases the risk of second-hand smoking, but also exposes more individuals to it. Since the fumes stay around for longer periods of time and are unable to escape from the enclosed air-conditioned compounds of the restaurants, diners at the restaurants would hence be breathing in these fumes and be more exposed to the harmful effects of second-hand smoking. Also smoking will affect the mood and dining experience of people at the restaurants as the stench from the cigarette fumes is not bearable to most people. Restaurant owners will also be affected if diners are being turned away by the strong cigarette smell and choose to dine elsewhere. In this case, the welfare of society is being adversely affected by the smoker's actions. Hence I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. (298 words) ",SIN
"A saying goes, ""you should faithful to own your work. "" This means that students don't need to earn money during school days. Thus, I'm in favor of the idea that it has never been important students to be a part-time worker. It's because students have a right to enhance their ability. Moreover, enjoying college life is important part of students' lives as well. First of all, spending a lot of time with improving talent is the most significant part of their lives. It's true that students who haven't worked during school days have better grade than students who have worked. For example, one of my friends got a temporary work, when she was sophomore. At that time, she couldn't concentrate on her study. Finally, she got the worst grade in that year. From those days on, she didn't try to searching for any part-time works. Besides, enjoying college life should be helpful to improve student's commercial skills. That means that students can interact with their classmates as participation in many schools circles such as team sports, band groups and so on. Students can exclusively make a variety of experiences through group activities. A study has shown that students who have enjoyed their school life's can make more successful life than others. In other words, growing commercial skill might become a key to successful life. For all those reasons, I strongly support on the idea of developing not only your faculty but communication skills. In order to get better life in the future, they have to make a good time schedules. Life style of college life might determine their whole life.",KOR
"Smoking is very bad habit. As a result of which environment it's polluted badly. It should be banned everywhere. While the restaurants is a public place, where people come to eat and refresh themselves. At this place, if smokers come due to smoking other people which are eating there are disturbed. Smoke is not only harmful for smoker but also for other people living around him. This smoke contains toxic substances like nicotine which is toxic for human health. It causes also lung diseases. In these diseases mostly respiratory disease and diseases belong to lung are common. It should be stressed by the administration of the restaurants that it is also place of public gathering where people come to eat, so environment of such places should ne healthy, so that people feel calm there. But if the surrounding environment of eating place filled with smoke, particle present in smoking and causing different diseases by directly entering into the body but also spread in the food.

"Nowadays, smoking is debatable topic for talking. Some people agree that smoking should be banned, but in the other hand some people disagree whether smoking should not be banned. In my opinion, government should not ban smoking activity as you know cigarette can increase the income of our country, both from the export to foreign country and also import to our country. The tax can be used to fulfill the needs of our country such as for allocate the payment of fuel cost, for building the facilities of our country better, for increasing the salary of the employee and many other function. Talking about smoking at restaurant it becomes controversial case because some people want to be free from the smog of cigarette. But other people also want to smoke moreover for active smoker. Therefore, they think that smoking should be banned because it can destroy other visitors. In the other hand, we have to think if the government ban the smoking it can make the production of cigarette will be lower than before. I am sure if the production is lower the factory will fire their employee from their work. It is so ironic. There will be so many people that cannot work again. They cannot fulfill their financial side. They cannot send their children to go to school, they also can not fulfill their daily needs. Therefore, I think the government should not ban the smoking case because it has many advantages for us, although there are many negative side that can appear from this case. As a smart people, we have to create the good thing that can make people both of active smoker or passive smoker feel comfortable in the same place.",IDN
"I agree with the statement. I'm going to show that why I think so. First, college students are already almost adult. So they should not depend on their father or mother. But I don't say that college students must be independent perfectly. I want to say that they should reduce their parents' responsibility. This is very important. Second, doing part time job has good effect for the student. It makes a lot of opportunity to talk or communicate a lot of people, as coworker or as visitor. They have really a lot of character. When student working, he must be professional. It is very hard and severe, but such experience will give him a lot of chance to grow himself. Doing part time job is wonderful thing. It gives us money and something priceless called 'experience'. Students should use the money to reduce their parents' responsibility. I said so. But, if student have a time and enough money, it is very good experience to go abroad. It is difficult to go abroad and communicate with foreign languages, after graduation. So, doing part time job gives us a lot of choice. So, college students should have part time job. But, what they really should do is studying. They never forget studying always.",JPN
"I think part time job is important. First, it makes me to feel importance of saving money. Before I entered the university, I already had experienced part time job. I worked in the factory in 5 days, in a resting place in 3 days and in restaurant in 3 days. I don't remember exactly due to work very shortly. But it was very tired and terrible. Whenever parents gave allowance, I had done anything to do. I bought clothes, ate out and went out to play with my friends. I didn't pay attention to the money before part time jobs did. I really knew how hard it was to earn the money. I thanked for parents after working. It is not bad that earning the tuition for myself. But one of bad points isn't time for me. Second, I felt a lot of things. At the end of each working, I thought that I really study hard. The other word, I really don't want work because part time job is too tired physically. But it makes me feel lots of things. For things that I want to do, study is very important. And I feel that there aren't easy things in the world. The little things need too much effort.",KOR
"Recently, some people argue that the current education system cannot equip the students with practical skills on working and just emphasizes the importance of the academic result. They suggest that university students have a part time job and this can improve the ability of problem solving. However, other may argue that taking part time job may affect the academic result of students. I think that the benefit of taking part time job outweighs its drawback. Firstly, taking part time job can give students with chances to learn more about team working as they may need to finish a proposal with other people. Most jobs such as sales manager involve team work and they need to operate each other well no matter what position of company. Also, their communication skills may improve as they need to talk with foreign people. Taking part time job is helpful for personal development of students. First, they can know their interest, weakness or strength if they try different part time jobs. Then, this can build up student's confidence as well as develop their own potential. Some people may argue that taking part time job affects the academic result of students. They even point out that some students may lose concentration during lesson and even may be absence in some lessons. In fact, such problem cannot exist if students can allocate time well. This also gives chance for student to learn how to manage time well.",HKG

"Absolutely I agree with the point. Restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smokes will destroy the warm atmosphere. And this also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that whether smoke depend on personal preferences, this is selfish behavior. It will make other people be unhealthy. The important thing is smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like those people who smoke in public place. As is known to all, smoking just make people increase the risk of cancer. And those second-hand smokers will be more influenced than smokers. Especially in public places, smokes are extremely harmful. Smokes are poison gas. If there is no one smokes in restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokes give up smoking so it is also benefit for them. A professor called Peter in HK university saidï¼‚one cigarette can kill at least 50 miceï¼‚. You know, smoking just make people feel boring but no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this well themselves. We have an obligation to make people more health life.",CHN
"I think the college students should have a part-time job because they can learn to work as one portion in society. For example, they will learn how difficult is it to earn money and will not spend money idly. I don't have a part-time job now. But I had worked at super market for one month. In spite of short time, I learned how to handle cash register, earn money, say greeting, behave to customers and etc. There may be an opinion that if the college students have time to work part-time, they should fill up more student life. But today we can have a part-time job if there is time just a little. So they can enjoy student life and have a part-time job. I think that it is better changing various part-time jobs than remaining one part-time job all the time because we can learn various things. For instance, we will find our good point and bad point and the work that fitted oneself. For these reason, the part-time job has many good points for the college students to grow up the adults.

"I think it is not important for college students to have apart-time job. I have three reasons why college student should not have part- time job. Firstly, College students have parents to support them about cost of study. They should only concentrate on study not doing part-time job. In my opinion, their parents want them to pay attention to study m ore than doing a part-time job for sure. Second, if college students do part-time job, they could not have enough time to study and do their homework. In addition, doing part-time job is not good for their health, because they have to study at day time and do part-time job at night time. They might be so tired. When they were in class and could not pay much attention to class. It is not good for their health and it is too hard for them to do two things in the same time.

They have parents to support them a cost of study, it could make them pay less attention to study if they do part -time job and it is not good for their health.",THA
"I agree with college students who have a part-time job. Because working is replacing time by money, students can spend time effectively. In Japan it is often said that a period of time of university is a moratorium, but they eager to make good use of the period. In fact, they don't like free time. To try to reduce free time, they study, play with their friends, go to the club to which they belong, and have a part-time job. The thing which they have a part-time job is a reasonable selection for college students who want to cut free time. They can get some money if they go to a part-time job. I think that a time of university is a time of investment in our own future. Though college students could have the choice to work after they graduate from high school, they go to university, and they also go to a part-time office to work. It seemed a mistake. But it is not a mistake because an investment is indispensable some money. Here is a problem. College students will face the problem that they have to get money for investment by myself Its solution is a part-time job. So, we can conclude that a part-time job for college students is reasonable because they can consume their precious free time effectively and get some money to invest.",JPN
"I definitely agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. I have been studying Japanese for a number of years, and last summer I was lucky enough to be able to live in Tokyo for several months. I love everything about that city, but the one thing that really bothered me was how smoky the restaurants and bars were. I also love to play pool, and the pool halls are ridiculously smoky. It makes it very hard to concentrate and have fun when your eyes are burning and you are coughing. All this is to say nothing of the horrible effects on people's health of that come from smoking. Smoking causes tar to build up in your lungs and affects the ability of your blood to absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. Furthermore, it has been conclusively shown that smoking causes cancer. In the past, the harmful effects of smoking were not well known or not well publicized, but now I feel that almost everyone is quite aware of the horrible things that smoking can do to your body. I don't understand why anyone would want to harm themselves on purpose, and I think that banning smoking in public places like restaurants is a great step in discouraging people from hurting themselves.",ENS

Other smokers in different parts of the world seemed to have managed OK with their bans and I think that Japan is capable of managing it as well. I am not trying to push smokers are target them just for the hell of it. It is simply that they may like sucking smoke but I don't and I don't have to. Let's have equality for all in the smoking saga so that they can smoke in their appointed spaces and we can enjoy no smoke in ours. Now that is what I call equality and a win-win for all.

"In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. There are two kinds of restaurant room. Smoker room and non-smoker room. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries So, for any body is not smoker, they can enjoy in the special room that different with smoker room. There is another argument rages over the effects of smoking on public health.

They are incessantly nagged, blamed for numerous illnesses and unpleasantries, and made to feel guilty by self-righteous non-smokers. So, banning smoking in all public restaurant violates principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers. However, smokers in the restaurant must choose the smoking area so that they will not harm the other customers who do not smoke and need the clean-air environment.",IDN
"I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons why I can't agree with the ban on smoking. First, banning at all the restaurants is too excess. Now, at many public place smoking is banned, for example the station, on the street and so on. And smoking area is increasing. So someone think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants too. But restaurants is eating space, and also resting space. Smokers relax at the restaurants by smoking. We don't have the right to deprive the smokers of their right to smoke. The other reason is that it is not necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants. Of course smoking does harm for our health, and even passive smoking also does harm to nonsmokers. So think it is better for smokers and nonsmokers to separate space in the restaurant. Then, nonsmokers can enjoy eating without worrying about passive smoking, and nonsmokers can enjoy smoking at the restaurant without about nonsmokers. In fact, many restaurants have smoking table and nonsmoking table. And I think it is good enough for smokers and nonsmokers to enjoy eating at restaurant.

"I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, in Japan, 26. 8 percent (man: 41. 3 percent, woman: 12. 4 percent) people are smoking.

But restaurants have already restricted smoking. They set up seats for smokers. All restaurants do not set up it, but almost major restaurants set up it. In addition, they set time, when people can smoke or not. For example, in lunch time (11:00~14:00) all seats (include smoking seats) are banned smoking. Restaurants concerned guests. Thus, restaurant's attitude is not to ban smoking. As long as someone legislates that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, restaurants will not ban smoking in restaurants. Restaurants choose profits. Restaurants provide a lot of comfy equipments for smokers and non smokers. I think just a few cheap judgment non smoking people yell ""smoking is too bad!

"In our country there are more and more college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's becoming quite common to see students busy running errands after lessons. Some say colleges students are expected to do concentrate on studying, because study is just like their jobs. However I think it's a good thing for college students to take a part-time job while studying. Although it is a truth that for a college student, his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations, it surely does not need to be the only target. In fact, college life which consists of only study is not balanced and may cause the student to miss out on other valuable learning experiences. In addition to bringing more balance to a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. He will have the precious opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced with a wider variety of problems to solve. Furthermore, work helps a student to develop greater independence, and earning his own pocket money can teach him how to handle his finances. Finally, a part-time job can help a student to develop a greater sense of responsibility and team-work spirit, both for his own work and for that of the team he works with. For all of these reasons above, I firmly believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college. Of course, they must be careful not to let it take up too much of their time because study is still their primary responsibility. To sum up, living a balanced life is the best way to be successful.",CHN

"I agree with the statement that having a part-time job is important to college students. My reasons are as follow. First of all, having a part-time job can teach us a lot through practice. As is known to all, our 4 years in college is a precious period in our life, during which we should not only learn how to study, but also learn about how to do. Compared with the academic activities like holding lectures, discussions or debates which aims to improve our learning skills, the do part has been largely ignored on the campus, though it is agreed that the latter one counts more when we step into society. Under these circumstances, it is the best choice that we take a part-time job outside the school. Second, when we are getting the experience, we also get paid. In some countries, students are already economically independent from their parents when they step into the university, but we are not. With a part-time job, we can get some burdens off our parents by using our own-earned money. Moreover, we can taste the pleasure of earning ahead of those without a part-time job. Third, we can get into another circle of people called the workmates. Unlike schoolmates and roommates you share joy with, workmates are those who work hard with you. You conquer difficulties together, and that would cultivate special feelings which you would probably value in a lifetime. In conclusion, having a part-time job can benefit us a lot without taking up too much time. So it's important and beneficial for students to get one in their college years.",CHN
"I disagree to the statement given in Topic B. A complete ban is an extreme measure against smokers and is hence, uncalled for. While smoking is a harmful activity that affects the health of smokers and the public who inhale the second-hand smoke, a complete ban to smoke in restaurants deprives the freedom of smokers completely. This is exacerbated by the fact that nicotine present in cigarettes makes it hard for smokers to kick the habit and hence they are inclined to smoke every few hours and even before or after meals. Therefore, a complete ban may spark fury amongst smokers due to the strict restrictions placed upon them. Additionally, while smoking is largely perceived as an unhealthy habit, smokers may argue that it is a form of activity that helps them to de-stress and a complete ban to smoke in restaurants is discriminatory. Furthermore, a complete ban on smoking could adversely affect the sales of cigarettes and thus affect some businesses negatively. Alternative measures should be introduced instead of applying a complete ban on smoking throughout the country. For example, depending on the design and location of the restaurant, partial smoking bans could be implemented instead. For instance, restaurants with outdoor and indoor dining areas can segregate their dining areas such that smoking is only permitted outdoors. This allows smokers to smoke freely outdoors while protecting the health of customers who prefer to dine indoors. Such a measure involving partial ban of smoking practices has already been implemented in Singapore. Therefore, the above arguments demonstrate that a complete ban of smoking practices in restaurants is not an ideal policy. ",SIN
"The opinion, that it is important for college student to have a part-time job, has some merit. There are several reasons why this is a good idea. Firstly, a college education is a significant expense for a college student and their family. Many families do not have the capital to pay the full cost of a college education and thereby have to cover the tuition by taking out a bank loan and in some cases even mortgaging their house or business. This puts a significant amount of strain on the family finances. Therefore, if college students can assist their families with financing, they should. Even if they don't earn enough to help with college tuition, a part-time job can help them pay for all personal expenses or study materials, thereby, reducing the pressure on their parents and encouraging them to become independent, mature adults. Secondly, a significant reason for all young people, including college students, to have part-time jobs is because it is great for the economy. In many countries, including Japan, a large percentage of shoppers are young people. They are the first to take notice of changes in fashion and technology and they often want to buy the latest products, thereby reviving the economy. In addition, when college student are working at local shops their labor cost is low, so shop owners can pass these savings onto the customer. This final point is most important to me.",ENS

A conclusion has still not been reached, however, I feel that the arguments that were presented from both sides would be similar to the arguments that will be presented from both sides if the same issue comes under discussion in Japan. To summarize things quickly, the nonsmokers feel that it is rude of the smokers to smoke in restaurants because they have to deal with the bad smell and harmful effects upon their health of the cigarette smoke. The smokers feel that the nonsmokers are trying to impose upon their freedom to do anything they want to do, and personally I feel that this is a very serious problem and I would feel very bad if someone tried to tell me what I could or couldn't do. The solution that my state currently uses is to separate restaurants into smoking and nonsmoking sections, and this works to varying degrees of success. Some restaurants have a very good nonsmoking area where you cannot even tell that the restaurant also has a smoking area, but some restaurants have a smoking area that is almost indistinguishable from the non-smoking area. I think that it will take some time to find an even better solution to this situation.",ENS
" In recent years, more and more peole, from the old to the young, male to femal, millionaire to the poor, have tended to smoke. But actually smoking should be forbidden immediately. On one hand, smoking dose have some advantages. For example, smoking a cigarette can refresh ourselves and make us energetic when are teried and sleepy. Besides, when we feel bored, it is a good way to kill time. Some people like smoking when they thinking about something. They said sometimes inspire will come across in their mind when they smoked. Moreover, some young adults smoke just because it looks cool. It is because smoking have so many advantages that lots of people are addicted to it. However, on the other hand, smoking's disadvantages are much more compared to advantages. One of the biggest disadvantages is that smoking is very bad to our health. It's said that if you smoke a cigarette, you will live several seconds shorter. Because there are much harmful substance in cigarette fog. If we breatheit into our lungs, it can easily cause lung cancer. Besides, if we smoke, our families will smoke second-hand cigarette, and this is even much more harmful. What's more, the bad fog will pollute the air. Last but not least, if we are addicted to smoking, we will spend a lot of money. It's a big trouble for the poor. In a word, smoking's disadvantages are much bigger than advantages and smoking should be forbidden at once.",CHN
"In the restaurants have many people whether children or the elderly and there are some people for smoking. If you are the one who does not smoke and you do when you see people smoking in restaurant. You should be alert to him but you wouldn't dare same me. It is very bad smell and I don't like it. In order to protect children and some people not smoking because of the smoke of cigarette can harm health of people not smoking, at the restaurants is the public place, smoke can taste changes and is a bad example for children because in restaurant have many children. Therefore the country must to set the law about banned smoking at all the restaurants or open zone for smoker at all. In order to protect the people not smoking from smoke of cigarette. And the law should be strict and should punish people that smoke in public because will have some people smoking break the law if this law not strict. But some places should except the law such as pub and bar because pub and bar of drinking and drug. But the country should set the low for protect many people not smoking.",THA
"I quite agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. However, this is very complicated because in general, Indonesian people are people who really do not discipline against a regulation, especially laws that they think are not important and interfere with their comfort. This used to be very regrettable because I saw a lot in public places is primarily Restaurant banned smoking even though it is already marked but the smokers still smoke in the venue. This is of course very disturbing, especially for consumers who do not smoke in the restaurant - others, especially women and children. And if the smokers are in general warned they would be offended and angry. One which I think is very funny and absurd. We will not be able to become a great nation if the people manage discipline alone cannot. I see the efforts were good enough to provide a place for smokers and banning smoking in public places, but it will not work if no strong action for the perpetrators. So I think for every restaurant should provide special places for smokers with a short distance with other consumers who do not smoke. This is for maintaining the health and future of society itself.",IDN
"I don't feel that it should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. Where would the smokers go? I don't smoke myself but some of my friends do and it would be pretty tough for them to sit at a restaurant for a couple of hours without having a cigarette. I don't like being in smoke filled rooms so when I go out with them, we always try to pick a diner or restaurant that has plenty of space and good fans. I do know about the dangers of smoking and also breathing in second-hand hand smoke, but I think that it is OK if there is plenty of ventilation. Legally, I don't know if Japan can do that anyway or if they would want to because there are so many smokers in Japan who would probably complain and do a protest march on their local city office. Business owners can make their own choice on whether they want to ban it or not and their customers can decide if they want to go to a smoking restaurant or not. I think that we have to be careful about letting our governments have to much control over everything that we do. I am not a conspiracy theory believer but I wouldn't feel comfortable and would probably think that I was in the military being ordered around if governments decide everything for us in our personal lives as well.",ENS
"I agree to a large extent that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. For one, college students are at the age where they should start to gain financial freedom. While most parents will still be providing an allowance, college students should take the initiative to earn money to support their own needs. This will teach them to manage their finances and not take money for granted. In addition, part-time jobs can train them to be more independent. College students will be able to experience a taste of the real world, which is useful especially for those who are accustomed to cushioned and privileged lifestyles. Having working experience also helps increase students' maturity and imparts useful life skills, such as the ability to work collaboratively. Besides, the timetables in college are relatively flexible, making it easier for students to plan their time. They will have to be more disciplined with themselves. It is important that these students can plan their time and manage this asset. Having said so, juggling a part-time job may not be feasible for college students who need more time to concentrate on their studies or are actively involved in co-curricular activities. The priority for college students remains their education and if their grades would suffer, they probably should not commit to a part-time job and should focus on their studies instead. Therefore, it is important for college students to work part time as they will learn important skills and having an income helps alleviate the financial burdens of their parents. However, the importance of having part-time jobs pales in comparison to the importance of the students' grades. ",SIN
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Learning cannot be only at school, students nowadays need more experience in society. Part-time job is a good way for students to absorb the experience. It provides them the knowledge that cannot learn from textbook and some money that they can make their ends meet. Part-time provide a method that students can be productive and know how society works. And it is a way for students to use their free time, get away from the Internet, pub or doing nothing at home. But there is an important point to know: part-time job will never be more important than school. It is the only rule that I think every student who has part-time job should keep it in mind. The very work students should do is studying hard, absorb the knowledge from books and make it useful. College is the last level that you can learn things without pressure, you should cherish. If you think that working can learn more than school, why do you still at school? Why don't you leave school and get a normal job? Studying at school and learning from working are both important. Maybe school cannot teach you how to work better but it can teach you how to be a person. That is the main reason you stay at school.",TWN
"I don't like smoke. So I think smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurant in Japan. There are some reasons. First, people who smoke bother other people who don't smoke. For example, when I went to the restaurant with my friend, there were some people who smoked. Then, our pleasant dinner was over. We were tired of smoke. And when we got out the restaurant, our clothes smelled bad. I felt bad. Like this, smoking bother people. Second, smoking is no good for health. I hear that not smoking people's lungs are clean, but smoking people's lungs are black. Once you begin to smoke, it takes several years to return to healthy lung again. And generally speaking, people who smoke tend to become lung cancer. To make matters worse, not smoking people may become disease by passive smoking. Especially, it is not good for children's health. That is to say, smoking is bad for not only smoking people bad also not smoking people. That is why, smoking is banned at the all restaurant. Smoking people should consider people who hate smoke. I think that all people, from children to old people, enjoy dinner and talking at the restaurant.",JPN
"It is not important for college student to have a part-time job as it may not offer what is required for the students. Whether a not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and also their priorities. College life may have long breaks in between the semesters which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job which can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship in a company or to prepare for the upcoming modules they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a mean to fill their excess time and it also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during semester period as there will be lesser time spare for the student to do their academic work. However, having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can better enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that the importance of having a part-time job for students in college is not necessary unless by circumstances or by the needs that the students have to satisfy. ",SIN
"Part time job, it is carrying fewer hours per week as a part time work. A work that is convenient and can add an extra income. Students nowadays discovers on how they can use their free time to be more productive. They actually knew that having a part time job is a good thing to do. Every day, almost a lot of fast food chains are hiring jobs: food servicing jobs. They actually found out that students are can be good crews because they can learn very fast unlike of those elderly. And also fast food chains owners also want to help financially ill students to have a good future that's why they hire them. So that's why when you always went to your favorite restaurant you can actually see crews that is totally same old as you: a student like you serving to customers. We should thank them for helping people out. Part time job is not only to have work and to earn. You can also say that is a recreational activity because sometimes this is your first path to serve people and many enjoy this stuff. We should all know that our country is not that dependable yet. So our government cannot support each family who does need help. We should be wise and think outside of the box to survive, compete, and overcome this being worse poverty.",PHL
"For me it's not important for a college student to have a part time job. Nowadays, there are more and more students choose to have a part-time job in the spare time. Surely, a part-time job can provide cash and working experience to them. They are called student for them to study not to work. So we should grab all the opportunities that we are given the chance to study and learn many things. That our parents work so hard just to provide us the best education. But not all of us have a good condition of living; some is suffering from financial problems. A person who really wants to study will find ways to support their studies, just like by having a part time job. Having a part time job has also a good effect for a student, because it prepares them to the real world after studying. Besides, a part-time job would occupy college students a lot of precious time, which should be used to learn systematic knowledge and living skills in class without worries of work stress and frustration. Also the college students provide a community to fit in the real world, so that students can develop these necessary qualities and skills. I think it's definitely not a wise option to take a part-time job in exchange of losing some parts of such important opportunities of education.",PHL
"Smoking is an expensive habit and it should be banned. Although smokers claim that it helps them to relax and release stress, the negative aspects of the habit outweigh the positive. It is a health hazard for both smokers and non-smokers and it is especially harmful to unborn babies. Cigarettes are also addictive because of the nicotine they contain. Cigarette smoking causes a number of health problems that are expensive to treat. It is a major cause of respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer and bronchitis. It also leads to heart disease. In spite of the money that the Government receives from taxing cigarettes, the cost of medical treatment for these diseases exceeds this income. As a consequence, non-smoking taxpayers are forced to pay for the health costs of smokers. This is a very unfair situation. Another reason for banning smoking is that cigarette smoke affects the health of non-smokers and unborn babies. Non-smokers soften suffer from eye and nose irritations, allergies and headaches as a result of inhaling second-hand smoke. There is also evidence to suggest that passive smoking may cause lung cancer. Smoking during pregnancy can hinder to growth of the fetus and may even result in death. Finally, the nicotine, which is found in cigarettes, is highly addictive. Other addictive substances such as cocaine and heroin are illegal. The fact that tobacco remains legal is an anomaly. Thus, in summary, smoking causes numerous illnesses that are expensive to treat. It disturbs non-smokers and is an unhealthy addiction. Therefore, cigarettes should definitely be banned so as to make the world a better place for everyone.",KOR
"In this recent year, college students have so many problem about their daily life either their study or their daily needs. In Indonesia the university is usually in a big city. The students who lives in a village force to leave their village for the sake of their education. So this condition takes them in a boarding house that they will stay. This also forces them to have a much money to supply their daily needs in their boarding. Therefore, most college students have a part time in job beside their lecturing activities. Job is their solution to supply their daily needs. As a college students, they have to make a balance between studying and their job. Unfortunately, must college students can not do it. They are focusing on their job instead of their studying. This condition takes them in a job thinking. They just think where and when or what time they will get a job. Therefore, their studying score will be bad. When a person gets a job, they will force to have a great power. As a college students, they have to be more clever in managing the time and their health. In fact, most of college students who has a part time in job, they are usually not in a good condition. Their power runs out after having a job. As a result, they will little bit ignore their lecture because they are tired after having a job. In this case, the government have a big role to solve this problem. It can not be ignored to this problem. The government should give more scholarship for poor students, so the college students can focus on their subjects without facing their daily life problem",IDN
"Some people may argue these days that students should not take part-time jobs while attending college, but I disagree. I think that a large majority of students want to work anyway, for many reasons. Perhaps it may be to assist with repaying their parents for funding their education or maybe they need to pay for self-funding. Regardless of their motives, working part-time, aside from the monetary gains, allows students to gain important professional, social skills not found in college. By that I mean, how to conduct themselves and interact within the work environment. If it is their first job, then they will also learn organizational and time management skills which they will surely need if the intend to work and study at the same time. They may even be fortunate enough to be employed in an area that is connected to their studies. If not, then any form of legal employment would be beneficial to them in one way or another. If they plan their time accordingly, it will still leave ample time for social activities, extra studies or even take on supplementary short courses that compliment their career goals if they choose to do so. The positives of being employed early in their careers, far outweigh any negative arguments to the contrary.",ENS
" This time, a great many university students choose to do part-time job during their leisure time. The desire for this is quite different, some for the financial aid, some for the working experience. Even, there are many people who just want to learn to how to adjust to the cruel social competition. Here I'd like to say something about my point of view. Firstly, from doing part-time, you can learn many things that we can't get in book. During working, you start to find out how hard to survive, to live on one's own. This will bring a lot of benefits to our future while the others are complaining about the hard pressure. Moreover, if the part-time job is concerned with your major, it will put your knowledge into practice. That's would be excellent advantage when you take part in an interview when the company takes the working experience seriously. There is no doubt that part-time job will make you more independent from your parents and family. However, every coin has two sides. Part-time job will surely take lots of time, not only spare time, but also your study time. So there is an annoying question which is faced with you: how to keep a balance between the work and study? Speak personally, I tend to put study in the first. For your job is student, your main task is to study, to get higher grade, not just for the money that seem to make your present life more comfortable. In conclusion, if once I am about to do the part-time job, I will see does it have anything to do with my major or does it cover too much time. Anyway, study while doing the job is my hope.",CHN

"After graduating in high school, most students would enter college and finish a degree. Some of them may be enrolled without having any financial problems, but some does not. Some students have a scholarship, have a financial assistance, and some chose to have a part-time job. Some chose to have a job, and some just bluntly does not. Students working in the Philippines are rampant, and the number is still growing. Having a part-time job could take up a lot of time and it could be tiring as well. But in reality, do they have a choice? To continue their studies, they should help in finding ways to earn money and stay in their chosen program and university. In my honest opinion, college students should not have a part-time job, because they should only focus on their studies. Although countless numbers of students are working, some universities chose not to let their students be involved in part-time jobs. But are there other ways to help them? In what ways can we decrease the number of students working, and at the same time, studying? Like at De La Salle University, the school's main goal is to let their students focus on their students and not be ignorant of the opportunity to study in DLSU. Almost 15% of the student's population are supported by financial grants and scholarships in order to continue their stay in the university. Opportunities like these are gradually increasing and this is a great system for student to have their dream to graduate and to finish their studies in flying colors. So, what should one really do? One would only have to focus and work smarter on one's studies. If one makes this happen, one would be successful in the future and could help in the betterment of this dilemma.",PHL
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When I say more, walk smoking should be banned everywhere. There are some reasons for my opinion. First, smoking harms not only smoker's health but also non-smoker's health. I have heard secondhand smoking is worse than smoking. In other words, it is to say that the person who does not smoke is easy to suffer from cancer. Why non-smokers are harmed by smoker? If smoker want to smoke anyway, smoker should smoke alone. I don't think smoker trouble non-smoker. Second, there are people who don't like smoking smell. Cigarettes smell unique. So, there are people who are made feeling bad. Third, I think the quantity that smoker smokes will decrease by enduring to smoke after meal. A smoking rate is 50 percent at present in Japan, and smokers are pointed the badness of their manner. For example, there are walk smoking and littering cigarette. These destroy environmental. If the quantity that smoker smokes decrease and number of smoker, the quantity that walk smoker and littered cigarettes may decrease. Problem of prohibition of smoking is difficult to solve.

In fact, it is clear that smoking is one of the most causes to lead to cancer. And smoking gives bad influence to not only their own but also around people. I think this is the worst point of smoking. And I need not ban smoking completely. I think that the restaurants should divide into smoking people and not smoking people. GREEN MOS BURGER is a good example. In there, smoking seats are placed outside the shop and non-smoking seats are placed inside the shop. This is very interesting. Few years ago, in there, smoking seats were placed inside the shop. This is cared about this problem. Now at the many restaurants, smoking seats and non-smoking seats are divided inside the shop. I am satisfied with this situation. But the restaurants that are banned smoking are increasing. So if I think about the matter in terms of management, it is good to build the restaurants for smoking people.

"In my opinion, part time job; the job that one can do after his class, work or when in the free time, has some advantages because off having more many things from working. The advantages that I mention are having more money, more experience and more communication. The advantages of the part time job, first, it's having more money. When one do his work, it' sure that he must be earned money and also part time. The second is having more experiences. When one works, he can learn many things form that working. The part time job can be added him more experience when he works. The last of the advantage is having more communication because when one works, he must communicate with others. It's mean he must talk, think or solve some problems with his colleagues, so he can learn these communications from the job that he works. Therefore, when one can learn many things from his working, he can be added the others by the part time job too.

It is important to learn how to work quickly and efficiently so that if you have a large project on your hands, you can deal with it well. Companies will appreciate students who have developed this skill as they can make better use of their time and the salary of their pay by the company and produce higher quality work.

"Smoking is not a good habit. It costs a lot of money and will do great harm to smokers' health. But there never lacks heavy smokers.

Public places are for all so smoking there is unbearable for the bad smell. What's more, it will pollute the air and make others to do a second smoking when nobody is aware of it. So, I am strongly against for smoking in public. From my point of view, I think smoking is completely a bad habit because it brings us no benefits. It just like drugs, people are addicted to it and are damaged by it slowly. Watch those who die from lung disease, most of them are heavy smokers.

"Smoking has always been in the midst of our society since time immemorial: from the small-scale tobacco productions during early times to large-scale cigarette productions at present.

Many people I know are smokers, and I have seen what effects it holds against abusers. For me, I do not think that cigarette smoking should be banned at all. It is us who suffer the implications it brings about, but it is also us â€“ not our family, friends, government or anybody else â€“ who should learn to control our inhibitions. Even though I am against smoking, I don't see why it should be banned in restaurants. It is a matter of free will, and I don't think that we should alienate people the rights or at least the privilege to enjoy a puff after their favorite meal or alongside their favorite beverage. So as non-smokers are less likely to protest regarding the matter, it should be mandatory not for restaurants to ban smoking, but to provide a segregated area in the restaurant where smoking is allowed.",PHL
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Needless to say, there are some benefits for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, they can earn some money to use. Nowadays, being a college student means spending lots of money to buy clothes, books, and other things but his or her allowance is sometimes not enough to meet the needs. Moreover, some students should pay for their own tuition because the tuition is too expensive for their parents to pay. It will be very helpful to have a part-time job as a student for them. Secondly, they can build up their mind for the future. If they want to get a job in future, they can apply for a part-time job related to the field and they will face the reality of the field, not a fantasy. Also, one can be interested in a job after having a part-time job even if he or she didn't heard of a thing about the job. The last and the most important reasons for having a part-time job is that one can experience lots of things which can happen in a society. As a student in a college, he or she probably doesn't know what the society or workplace really is and one can learn this by having a part-time job. For example, he or she can learn how hard one should work to earn money and what ability is required to be successful.

However, I not think that part-time job is important because college students can do any hobby that they like and part-time job is just a choice. For example, play music instrument, study more languages, play sport, participate in campus activity etc. I think the most important thing in campus life is study and social. Good grade in studying make an achievement in education and finding work easily, so I think you should have enough time to study and practice lesson. If you can organize your time very well and have no problem in studying, part-time job is interesting choice for you that you can learn about what people thinking, social, many styles of worker but if you can't, it is risk to do part-time job because you will have more stress and maybe have no time for studying.

Today we are living in 21st century for which an 18th or 19th century man had just wondered that it would be the perfect time to live in with every type of facility. Now living in 21st century we can see that his dream was true but partially because today every type of modern facility is available in market but far away from the range of a middle class person because the living expenditures are touching the heights of skies and it is being more and more hard to survive for lower class people to survive with these circumstances. As the consequence of this situation it is not possible for an ordinary man to educate his children up to metric level and to fulfill his desires of better future so the students are themselves compelled to do part time jobs to continue their studies smoothly. On the other hand students who do part time jobs along with their studies become more punctual and hardworking then their other class mates and these habits lead them to be gentle in their upcoming professional lives. So the conclusion is that 'yes' part time job is necessary for college students but this statement should not be taken as negative because it also affects good on one's future life.,PAK
"I agreed with it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion college is such an important course. Because when we graduated from college. We may face the choice to go to institute or to become a fresh graduate. It is very precious to have a chance to get a part-time job. Because its experience will become a great reference when we have a job in the future. But don't forget our duty, we are students. So we should choose the job wisely. First, we have to know clearly that the part-time job not only just for the money to release our financial pressure but also get some experience to let our vision widely. Second, don't spend too much time on the part-time job, we are students not workers. Don't spend too much time on the job. We should make a balance between study and job. Third, choose a job which can give you more experience, inspire. Like school's librarian instead of strain store staff. Part-time job have a lot of benefits. Apparently, we can earn more pocket money, making new friends and most of all we may find a way about what we want to do in the future.",CHN
"Many countries have restrictions on the quantity of cigarettes or tobacco that can be brought into the country. In many countries, tobacco products are taxed heavily, so travelers importing more than a few packets of these products should expect to pay import duties. On the other hand, many countries also have facilities that permit departing travelers to purchase these same products, duty free, at the border, as they leave the country. People who smoke products other than tobacco should be aware that cannabis and other recreational substances are prohibited in many countries. Some countries impose severe penalties for attempting to import even a small quantity. If you are found in possession - and some cases even carrying implements that can be, or have been, used for smoking these products - you may be arrested and imprisoned, possibly for life. In Asia, particularly in China, smoking is still something of a social activity, at least for men. Anyone with cigarettes will offer them around before he lights up; having an expensive brand is a status symbol. Female smokers may be thought odd; more men and fewer women smoke in Asia than in Western countries. Restaurants do not usually have non-smoking areas; many do not have ashtrays either. Areas such as bus stations may have ""no smoking"" signs, but these are often ignored. Non-smokers should be prepared to endure smoky rooms. Even in China, though, this is slowly changing. Smoking is now forbidden in many restaurants, at least in major cities.",THA
"I agree with the statement with the part time job because of having experience for ourselves and to earn money after school for extra expenses in the study. If we have some chances to help our family we should do. We should not disturb our parents to find more money to support us. We are going to be adults in the social so we have to learn how to survive in the real word. Having part time job can teach us how we should react to the other employees and customers if we do the service job. Life is not that easy so we have to learn from part time job. We will be strong and ready when we graduate from university or school. If we decide to have part time job, we should manage the time. We should know when is the right time to work. Don't spend too much time on part time job but we should concern about our study, our homework from school. Study is more stability than earning money in short time. If we have a degree, the job is more stable for us. It is good to have a part time job but we should know when to have it and make decision.",THA

Smoker get only carbonic-acid gas 20-30 % but people around smoke get more carbonic-acid 70-80 % and result in cancer. So it's not fair for people don't smoke. I feel moody and headache when I smell smoke. The bed thing I smell smoke when I have lunch in restaurant. I think it's very false thing and not appropriate. It make my food is very unclean and disturb having lunch. It performs no have politeness and respect of living in society. Some places are forbidden smoking or set place for smoker. However, the all restaurant should be place without smoking for good sanitation. People in the restaurant want benefit from food not dangerous from smoking. So I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it's thing support eating and makes no have risk about cancer.",THA

"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, as a college student, the knowledge from the text book is not the only resource to learn, the skills in life which beside the text book are also important, so it would be a good chance for college students to have a part time job to learn other things that could not get from normal school life. Also, a college student should also learn how to be independent in economy. That is, it is not so good for a college student who still gets money from their parents. On the other hand, if a college student can get a part-time job, he or she can buy the things he / she like without guilty. Finally, a college student can learn pre job lesson by having a part-time job. There are very different environments in college and real society, so if a college student can make the part-time job as a practice for stepping into the real society, he or she might be can get prepared much quickly than other college students who don't have a part-time job. Those are the reasons why I think that that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",TWN
"Smoking. we certainly no stranger to what it was smoking, cigarettes. in this world everyone would know cigarettes and most certainly never smoked. actually smoking was banned in Indonesia this country, but still there is a break. but how else, the nature and behavior of people can not be prevented. smoking is very harmful to our health. But strangely enough even though the pack or packs of cigarettes have included writings about the dangers of cigarettes is very scary, still many who smoke. Cigarettes contain more than four thousand of substances and two thousand of them have been declared impacted not good for our health, such as radioactive materials and substances used in paint, washing floors, ubat silverfish, toxic gases (hynide) used diagi pesalah who undergo the death penalty, and many more.

"I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Usually by the time students get to college, their daily allowances given by parents may not be sufficient. This is because there are not as many restrictions for college students as compared to being at a younger age, so they can hang out longer and more often with friends and therefore increasing their expenditures. They are also easily influenced on their wants over needs which may result in overspending. Not all parents are willing to hand out extra cash to their children to satisfy their wants instead of needs. Getting a part-time job helps to sustain their lifestyles and enables them to spend whatever they earn, or there are also others who want to save can save more compared to relying only on their allowances. Some students may also think that they are old enough to take care of themselves and not rely on their parents all the time so they will earn their own allowances by getting a part-time job. Although most students tend to get part-time jobs, there are also those who do not need a job at all because their families have higher incomes and are willing to support and maintain their children's lifestyles. The parents can just give them whatever money they ask for and buy them whatever they want. ",SIN
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We should experience a lot as social study when we are students. Especially, communication skills needed by the social of future are important for us. Communicating with various people through part-time job must acquire these skills and other many important things. For instance, we can acquire cooking skill when working in restaurant, skill of explaining things well when working as a cram school teacher, and communicating skill in English working in a shop where foreigner often come like my friend. She said that she is glad to use English skill she acquire as a member of society. And my friend said that he had never understood importance of working and importance of his parents until he bigan to work as a part-time job. I thought so, too. Then, I think that there are some students who must work to make money for the costs of study in school and the cost of living like I. For example, their family is not wealthy, but they hope to study in university. They have to make money using the scholarship. So, I think a part-time job teaches us not being able to learn at university but important things working is important for college students.",JPN
"I don't agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. I think it is problem to prohibit smoking completely. There are two reasons why smoking shouldn't be entirely banned. First, tobacco has strong dependence. A lot of smokers can't stop smoking even if they want to break their habit of smoking. If people who are smoking really stop smoking, they must have fixed preparation. It would take long time to succeed in no smoking. Second, there are many smokers in Japan. We can't disregard the population of smoking people. Today, the treatment for smokers becomes more and more severe. For example, smoking is basically prohibited in platform and shopping center. It is permitted only in smoking room. Like this, I think we should not ban completely but divide between smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at all the restaurant in Japan. If smoking is banned completely, smokers would be dissatisfied. But of course it must not be entirely allowed. If it's not divided, people who don't smoke would be displeased. There are a lot of people who hate tobacco because it's fact that smoking injures our health. We should consider both of them. So I think smoking shouldn't be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan.",JPN

"I agree with this opinion. I have three ideas. First, college students have to lern how hard to earn money is. In order to make money, you have to smile even when you don't feel good, you have to obey your manager even if you don't like him or her. It is not so easy to earn money, but by knowing it, you can lern how important money is. If you guraduate from college without knowing it, you may spend hard time when you get job. Second, you can be known with a lot of people. By having a part-time job, you can communicate with a lot of people. Some people go to other colleges and other people don't go to college and have been working for a long time. You can lern so many things from these peple.

"Smoking â€“ it is one of those that are called recreational drugs. Yet for some reason, they are generally accepted in the society. We've heard those adverse effects that smoking brings about. We've heard them over and over in every health-promoting program. But putting that aside, don't you think smoking is just being plain inconsiderate of other people? Apart from being utterly dangerous and life-threatening to both first-hand and second-hand smokers, it simply is a violation of the social ettiquette. This especially applies to public places like restaurants. Just imagine how crazily annoying it would be to have smokers ruin your appetite just when your food arrives. The smoke will surely mess with the appetizing aroma of your food. Eventually, your whole food experience will seem unfulfilling and just plain terrible. That is why banning smoking in such places would be fitting for our society. Restaurants are closed areas; therefore, smoking inside such areas would cause a lot of discomfort for everyone in the restaurant. iClearly, it is not only those who are trying to enjoy a fulfilling meal that are affected. Even those just chilling in the area are also being bombarded with unfavorable smell and smoke. In short, smoking in restaurants and other public places is exposing random people to your harm. Still, it is not only the customers who experience this dilemma with smoking. By smoking in such places, one also threatens the restaurant since it would definitely discourage customers. Smoking ruins the ambiance that the restuarant efforts to keep for their customers to enjoy. Therefore, implementing a law regarding this would be best. Smoking should definitely be banned in restaurants and the like. Needless to say, smoking is harmful and really, really, really annoying.",PHL
"I have never had a part-time job in my life, but I have had a full-time job after I completed my A level examinations last year. My full-time job was in a private hospital in Singapore, and I had to assist the doctor and register patients coming into the clinic. I was based in the Women's Centre, and it as definitely an eye-opening experience, especially when I was allowed to shadow the doctors in their consultation rooms. What fascinated me most were the pregnant ladies who came for their regular consultations with their gynaecologists. These women and their husbands seemed so happy looking at their unborn children using the ultrasound apparatus. Unknowingly, I felt happy for them too. However, the doctors had to be the bearer of bad news sometimes, such as telling the mothers that they had miscarried. This broke my heart, and my heart went out to the women who had to undergo such mental trauma. I saw many of them breaking down immediately, while there were others who tried to remain strong despite the pain they were feeling. Some of the doctors were very good at comforting their patients, while others were remained ignorant of their patients' feelings. Seeing such scenes almost on a daily basis inspired me even more to become a doctor.

"I agree with the statement. There are three reasons that I agree with it. First, college school students need money to do something. For example, some students want to go abroad during summer vacation to study English, it costs a lot of money. If some students need to buy a book to study their specialty, they need to money. That is why they need money in a lot of cases. Second, part-time job is one of way to know society. I think that most of college students hardly know about society. Because they have been alive in school and have not done part-time job. Of course I had not done it until I became college student. I have known how hard to get money since I became part-time job. I work at soup shop now. I have not wondered the difficulty of the rules in the shop until I started working here. I think that if I did not do part-time job, I could not do these experiences. So students should know society before they get a job. Third, college students are independent from their parents. In Japan, college and high school are not obligation. So college and high school students should earn money theirselves. But many high school ban to do part-time job. Students cannot do it. So high school students do not have to do it. But I have not heard a college which ban to do part-time job. So they have to work to earn their money. That is why I agree with the statement.",JPN
"I think that smoking is dangerous. It can kill both direct and indirect way. The direct means when you smoking, some smoke and chemical access to your body after that all bad diseases will show the results. You may be sick at the beginning but after that you will find out all cancer cells works and they going to kill each part of your body rapidly. The indirect is the man who is not smoking but accidently sitting beside the smokers also receive chemical from cigarettes. This poor man is very unlucky. He never knows that something bad already go through his body. When he met smokers over and over again, finally, he will have the same bad effects from cigarettes as well as the smokers. Another point, it is my personal view which isn't based on any other ideas or research. I think smoking can cause global warming as well. Why I think like that because there is smoke! When many people keep smoking and the number is increasing day by day, in all country around the world. Our world is covered with all smoked from the cigarettes. Finally people may die from the smoke of cigarettes. So if you are attracted to smoking in restaurants is not even good because it makes other people injured from cigarette smoke.

Because they think, if a college students get job so, that job will annoy concentrate their taks in the college. I'am a college student in one of famous university in Surabaya. I have reason myself. I think a college student to have a part time job is ok. But, they must be able to manage their time between lecture and job efficiently. If they can't do it so, I think they more better don't do it.

"Many people have the unfortunate need to smoke while eating every now and then. To accommodate this need, there have been restaurants that allow their customers to smoke. The restaurants are aptly able to satisfy the needs of the customers by separating the smoking section from the rest. However, there have been several instances when the smoke from the separated section reaches the nonsmoking area which cause discomfort with most nonsmoking customers. An instance would be the opening of the door leading to the smoking section which consequently allowed the smoke from that section to move to the nonsmoking area. The possible discomfort of the customers can be result of several reasons. One of the common reasons is the smell. For a nonsmoker, the smell of cigarette can be quite repulsive and can even cost their appetite at times. Another possible reason is that they can become second-hand smokers which are a more dangerous situation than first-hand smokers according to research. Also, they tend to have the feeling that part of the smoke seem to be attached to the food it passes through, further resulting in their reluctance to eat. It can then be noticed that the risk is that the majority of a restaurant's customers, who are nonsmokers, can be quite unsatisfied. Their discomfort can be factor in the decrease of a restaurant's profit and it cannot be denied that their health can be affected in a negative manner. Also, a smoker can always make ways such that they will not have the urge to smoke while eating. Furthermore, there is a slight chance of lessening their smoking if they do not smoke while eating. Thus, it would be better and healthier to completely ban smoking in all restaurants.",PHL
"Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is an important behavior to ban smoke at restaurant and we should not allow this condition in the restaurant any more. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to the smokers and in the meantime to others. Although those people have been addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the others' health in public. Moreover, it is common believed that smoking destroy the elegant atmosphere at the restaurant. Non- smokers don't want to get harmed by the cigarette smoke in the restaurants. They come to the restaurants for a happy meal. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. In summary, taking many factors into consideration, I hope that this phenomenon will disappear after so many people's combat. Besides, our government had better take actions to protect the environment at restaurant and solve the problem as soon as possible.",CHN
"One the whole, I don't think it should be banned through the legal system. It should be a choice of the restaurant owner. Then I would foresee that most restaurants would go non smoking but at least a few would still keep ashtrays on the tables. But what if I am a restaurant owner, especially when I am a school restaurant manager? You know, all the restaurants in Wuhan University do not give permission for people to smoke. But I still see somebody smoking. I would ban the smoking strictly. Now I will give you my reason. A person like me who does not smoke also have a right not to smoke, I mean, second hand smoke. Second hand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking including lung cancer and respiratory diseases. The famous website Wikipedia list several million words about the bad effect of passive smoking. And according to some experts, the cause of passive smoking is even worse than first hand smoking. What's worse, the smoke causes horrible effect to pregnant woman and little baby. So, considering about our country's future, I am strongly against smoke. Restaurants are places for eating; a satisfaction of your appetite, so at least in some degree eating can substitute with each other. So it is easier to forget smoking, especially for those smoking addicts. So smoking should be banned in restaurants, especially in those school restaurants.",CHN

The third reason is that the money and experience we can get through a part-time-job help us to become independent. We cannot rely on our parents forever.

"College students are usually at a stage in their lives where they have the ability to learn many things. It seems like these days work ethics is a big issue. If college students had part time jobs and could understand how to work with others and carry out various task to accomplish a goal at work, this could be rewarding for their character and personal growth not to mention learning or understanding something new. Basic work ethics are learned through part time jobs. Having a part time job in college will teach the student discipline and give them an understanding of money and how it is earned. Looking to the future and seeing more college students with credit cards gives more reasons to be concerned. If parents of the students pay for everything the students will not have a sense to payback what they have borrowed from the credit cards. This will carry over into everyday life and will show irresponsible students and eventually breakdown the economic system which is happing today. Students must learn the value of money and how it is earned, to do this they must spend time working and not spend more than they have earned. Using credit cards is a false sense of money and the credit card companies are constantly pushing students to use cards, therefore, students spend more than they earn without having to get a part time job and rely on their parents to take care of the bill. If credit cards were banned from campus more students would understand the value of money and have to get part time jobs.",ENS

Indeed we can see people enjoying having a meal and communicating at restaurant in Japan, say, izakaya or so. Though it might be because they are drinking, smoking must help them have a good time. Restaurants should offer the place where their customers can enjoy themselves and have a meal relaxed, even if someone who doesn't smoke insists that the smoke of tobacco does harm than good for him. It is a restaurant that is responsible for solving the problem like this. In other words, the restaurant should divide the seats for non-smoker from those for smoker.

Smoking has been causally linked to cancer, heart and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, passive smoking has been associated with lung cancers, allergies, eyes and skin diseases and so on. Restaurants usually have an enclosed environment where the air is not fresh; smoking will bring more damage to consumers' health. Secondly, smoking is usually considered as a potential cause for fire. Poorly placed cigarettes are very likely to start a fire in a restaurant where many of the furniture are inflammable. On the other hand, as most of the restaurants are equipped with fire alarms. Smoking will trigger fire alarms and will cause problems for the other consumers and the workers in a restaurant. Lastly, smoking are gradually considered as a bad habit and banned in most public places, such as airport, MRT and schools. Even though the restaurants are supposed to be places where people consume foods and get relaxed, there are non-smokers than smokers and it would surely benefit the smokers a lot if smoking are banned in the restaurants.

"There are many reasons as to why smoking should be banned in restaurants. From an economist perspective, smoking causes more harm to the society than to an individual because of the effect of second-hand smoking. More often than not, smokers often cause collateral damage in a sense that when they smoke, others unintentionally inhale the smoke. Second-hand smoking has been proven on many occasions through research to be more devastating to a person's health than actual smoking itself. This can more than substantiate the reason for banning smoking in public areas such as restaurants. On the other hand, banning smoking in restaurants can be harmful towards many restaurant businesses. Since restaurants are targeted at the more affluent crowd, who consists of a significant proportion of working class men who partake in smoking cigars as a social activity, banning smoking from restaurants might see a significant drop in customers. However, it can be argued that the extent of this effect is minimal. Of late, with aggressive campaigning against smoking in many countries, more people are quitting and less people are picking up this habit. Also, by banning smoking, it may attract more families to patronize such restaurants since they will be perceived as more family-oriented because of the restaurants' smoke-free policy. Thus, in conclusion the benefits of banning smoking in all countries far outweigh its disadvantages. ",SIN
"There are two large groups of people in Singapore who may engage in smoking activities. One group consists of people from the older generation who saw smoking as a sign of social and financial status, picked it up and then found it difficult to kick the habit, thereby continuing to smoke. Another group comprises the younger teenagers who thought smoking as a sign of coolness and picked up the habit in the hope of impressing people their age or to make a statement. Unfortunately, these people are those who frequent restaurants as well and this may cause problems in the eateries. In my opinion, smoking is detrimental not only to the perpetrator's health, but also to countless others who may have to linger around them. They destroy the lungs, stain teeth and confer bad breath. It is unmistakably a vice which should be banned from the country totally. Although this may seem a radical action; however, such extreme actions had been carried out successfully before, most notably in the banning of chewing gum from the country. Even though people may still smuggle in chewing gum occasionally, the current situation is probably much better than if it were not banned; it was always a show of intent from the government for the citizens to follow its lead. Hence, smoking should not simply be banned from restaurants, it should be banned from the country totally for the health of current generations and to create a better environment for future generations to live in.

"What would college students do during long summer vacation? Some students stay at home watching TV shows and playing on-line games around the clock. Others go to cram school for reinforcement of their schoolwork. The others take part-time jobs. Some people might think that students who take part time job suffering from materialization. However, I think that taking part-time job can not only broaden our personal relationships but also let us get more society experience. In my college, there are even a lot of projects that we can take part time jobs in some famous company, such as TSMC and UMC. Students can learn some useful techniques and know more about what they might do and get if they want to work in those company. Moreover, by taking part time job, students earn their own money and learn to manage it by theirselves. Besides, they might cherish it because they get it by theirselves. I think that it's more effective to have good notions of money by actual experience than learning on textbooks. Although taking part time job is a good way of learning a lot of experiences and there are truly a lot of goodness. We should know the drawbacks of taking part time job at the same time. As a college student, learning is still our main work. We still have to use a lot of time on learning. After all, our future work depends mainly on what we learn at college. Having a good balance between part time job and schoolwork is very vital for all of us.",TWN
"In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. Customers would decide without the government's help if they want to avoid smoke-filled rooms or enter them. They might even choose to sit in an area sectioned off for smokers or non-smokers, but the ultimate issue is choice. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries. When considering the bad effects of smoking, many smokers can't help but to feel trapped because of their addiction to nicotine. Cigarettes are the worst method of getting nicotine into your body. Many bad chemicals such as tar and formaldehyde, and carcinogens, clog your lungs up. Smoking is responsible for a host of respiratory conditions. It damages air passages and can cause emphysema. Cigarettes also worsen conditions such as pneumonia and asthma. Many longtime smokers suffer from chronic cough and excessive phlegm. Our government aims to protect us to save us from society's evils. However, in an attempt to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking. Banning smoking in all public restaurants violates this principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers.",PHL
"Smoking is very bad habit for a person or a society. It directly effect on human lungs it spread harmful diseases like lungs cancer, bronchitis, trachea blockage e. g. When a person will smoke a cigarette in a restaurant that dangerous smoke will spread on all eating foods which will be present in restaurants and when people come on that restaurant and eat that food which becomes harmful by dirty smoke. people can enter in many diseases. Another way smoke of cigarette not only harmful for a person who is smoking that dirty smoke will also harmful for those who will be present around him in restaurant that smoke entered in human body through breath and directly effective on human lungs. When some body do something new or different from others like only few peoples will take cigarette. so all of that activity will new for teenagers who never see smokers before it. They looked them with fully concentration so when they came back at home. if they get opportunity and alone in room they will trying to act like that smoker which was present in restaurant and children start smoking because teenagers have weak health and having polite parts of body so that dangerous smoke can be harmful for their health. Many women's are also came in a restaurants mostly women's don't like smokers and felt hesitation from them and can't be sit freely in front of any smoker. Smoking can be the cause of burning all restaurants are filled with furniture or large number of people present in a restaurant at a time so if any flame of cigarette lay on curtain or any other thing it cause fire and that fire can burn whole things and also effect on humans which will present in restaurant at that time. We find out that smoking in restaurant can be very dangerous for peoples so smoking in restaurant should be banned.",PAK
"I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The main priority of college students should be to study and study well, and having a part-time job might impede that priority. College students should maximize the school time to gain knowledge in order to excel in their studies and have the knowledge on-hand to be applied when they work, make friends and network, and take part in activities to hone their leadership skills and teamwork capabilities. However, having said that, it is important for college students to have internships or vacation jobs experiences so that they can have a feel of the working environment before they graduate, and can assimilate more easily into the corporate world. Part-time job, vacation job, or internship helps college students to better understand and appreciate the value of money. For those students who can manage their time properly, having a part-time job during the school term is a good learning experience for them as well. I personally do not hold part-time job during the school term so that I can focus on my studies, spend time with friends, and engage in activities. But I do take the vacation to hold full-time job or internship to gain experience and contribute to the financials of my family. ",SIN
The first thing that comes to the mind with this word is cigarette. but the cigarette is not only thing that is included in this but the cigar that was thought sign of high class till some decades ago huqqa that is still commonly used in our villages and most of the things like that are included in this category. It is said that one cigarette lessens one day of its user life. The tobacco used in the cigarette when inhaled it ruins the lungs create kidney problems and also causes heart problem for its users. Tobaccos is such dangerous thing that is not only effects its user but also harmfully effects the secondary users that are not using it but inhaling its smoke from surroundings. Everyone knows that it is dangerous for his health but still tobaccos companies are attracting the people by giving heart capturing adds on TV and their customers are increasing largely every year.

"Part time job is work which done to improve experience or money. Mostly it is used for extra money or to fulfill our commodities of life. People do part time job due to spend their leisure time.

"I, being employed with a part-time job, truly do believe that there is no wrong in having a part-time job while being a student. I honestly think that it is an awesome, great idea for students to have part-time jobs before they graduate from univercity, if they have the time and resources to do so. Students who are responsible, or learn responsibility, have nothing to loose but all to gain by having a job. A student that can maintain a part-time job gain excellent first-hand experience that cannot be gained from the classroom. In fact the experience they gain from the part time job will make them the right asset the company seeks to have as they not only have academic achievement but also the practical knowledge related to their academic knowledge. Therefore, experienced students applying for a job are more likely to be hired than someone who is not as experienced. This is because students with experience on their resume show that they have already proven they can handle a job while balancing study and other activities. Besides, they have also proved themselves that they are people who are ready to meet challenges, and are willing to work hard. Usually, these people are also people with more mature personality.",IDN
"I agree the statement Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I don't agree the statement smoking is personal habit. I think that all humans can live by the time, a human as biological thing live by the end time he can. But, in real world, most of humans die by early or middle time in biological human's life, said over 200 ages. I think the complex things kill people by the time they touch their end as biological things. For example, Smoking is the worst. Smoking makes not only a human's body but around people's bad. It is called, Fukuryu-en. Fukuryu-en is that smoke from a person smoking moves to other persons around the person, and this doing is the anti-manner thing because this smoke from one person makes other persons bad condition, for example Zensoku, cancer called Haigan or others, especially in common area where a lot of people are, for example parks, stations, airports, streets or others. The cancer called Haigan is the worst sickness. This sickness's killing rate is high rate and a lot of Japanese people were killed by this sickness. Smoking has large relationship to Haigan and many scientists think smoking causes Haigan So I think smoking should be completely banned in places where many people are.",JPN
"Whether doing part time job is good to university students or not? Many undergraduates have a mindset that they have become once they enter university. They think that it's their life and they may have power to set their route. Therefore, whether part time jobs are hood for university students, especially undergraduates definitely depends on the student himself. Normally, if students do part time jobs in summer vacation holiday, it won't do any harm to the students because they have plenty of free time. Therefore, doing part time job during summer holiday may help students to gain working experience from the society and won't affect their academic progress. However, if students do part time during semesters, it usually do more harm than good. The reason is that doing part time job will incepted student's academic progress, both physically and mentally. Physically, students use their time to study in exchange for the time doing part time job and mentally to said, doing part time job may exhausted student's fitness status, such as not enough sleep, rush life pace, etc. Therefore, normally students doing part-time job need a larger effort to study to retain their academic results. But whether this is good to students really depends, some may though that this kind of unfaithful harsh life style can be compensated by the money gained from their part time job. Therefore, it is hard to judge the answer for the question. To myself, doing part time really expands your visions and proficiency in suiting into the society, but it could be only done when time are available. As a student, studying is still our main purpose at this stage, doing part time is just an additional optional event to be done in the entire university life.",HKG
"Banning from smoking at all the restaurants in the country is the very nice policy for non smoking people, I think. Smoking in public often makes other people's health bad. Of course, a person who smokes well has very bad health, too. Precisely, why are there many people who smoke well? I have not the answer. I think that smoking has not any good point. However many people like smoking. May be, it is because of taste. For instance, drinking alcohol is with each taste, too. Drinking does not give other people big trouble. So I think it need not be banned from drinking. But, smoking is different from it. Smoking usually gives other people trouble. For instance, they are other people's health, mind, and visual. This is a very big problem. Extremely saying, it can have done not to trouble other people, but it must not have done to trouble other people. This is the only one thing that I want to insist. Today, there are many restaurants which have the role of smoking in Japan. But, I want more. I really want all the restaurants in the country to ban from smoking or have harder role. And people should not smoke not only in public as a restaurant, but also anywhere.",JPN
"There is nothing worse than coming home after dining out and finding that your clothes smell like an old fireplace or a dirty ashtray, because they have absorbed cigarette fumes. I wouldn't mind so much if I was a smoker I guess, but I'm not and the stench irritates me to no end. Now I am not saying that all smokers are bad and that they shouldn't be allowed in all public places, but I do feel that the areas that are set aside, if any, for non-smoking and smoking in restaurants in Japan are totally inadequate. Of course I have health concerns as well, just like many others do when it comes to breathing in secondhand smoke, but the stench seems to irk me more. Perhaps it's because it is immediately noticeable whereas illnesses and death usually just creep up on you. I don't believe that there is any easy way around this as I feel that any exhaust fan remedies are far from being the ideal solution. In my mind, there is no point in dancing around it and it would appear that the only viable solution would be for Japan to put a ban in place or quite possibly have completely separate smoking and non-smoking restaurants although, I am not too sure how viable that would prove to be as a business proposition.",ENS

There are billions of people addicted to the cigarette in our country and we could find people smoking everywhere, for instance, in restaurants, train station and even in schools where there are children, the future of our nation, just like smoking has already been a custom of us. As is known to us all, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and all the people staying around, and the second-hand smoking will have more terrible influences. At the same time tobacco cost a lot of our money day after day. Growing could also waste more resource which could be used for grain instead. So for the sake of ourselves, we are supposed to try our best to make more people give up smoking, which will also let us get more advantages. Firstly, the health of us and our family is very important. Secondly we could protect the nature by pouring less harmful gas.

"We cannot get a job if we are in middle or high school, so it is first time for getting a job when we enter into university, although it is a part-time job.

In Korea, there is no opportunity to know society when we are in middle or high school because Korea educational situation force students to only study hard. Their ultimate aim is to enter good university, so most of them do not know about people and world. They can know many things related to subjects, but they cannot know the real tings related to society. However, if we go university and start part-time job, we must learn many things about the world because someday, we must work in society after we graduate.

Through part-time job, we can draw your future job in your mind. And also, we can earn money, so it is help our parents. Therefore, I agree part-time job of college students.",KOR
"Too many people, smoking is cool. There is a certain aesthetic appeal of smoking and wisps of smoke that waft around the smoker. Many tobacco commercials, although there are not played on public television anymore in the United States, were very sexy and interesting to watch. I think that there is a lot of sex appeal to smoking, but more than that, I think there is a lot of money in the tobacco industry so there is no incentive for the tobacco companies to do anything that would harm their profits. If the government passed legislation that banned smoking at restaurants in Japan, the Japanese tobacco companies would probably be very upset and may even have some sort of countermeasure ready in case this event transpired. Nevertheless, I do think it is a very serious problem that the country allows smoking in public places because it is very harmful to the health of everyone around the smoker. Finally, cigarette smoke smells very bad and seems to permeate the homes and the clothing of smokers, which makes it unpleasant to be around them even when they are not smoking. In all, I think that smoking will hang around for a little bit longer, but it is necessary to ban it at public places like restaurants.",ENS
"I strongly agree with the topic of smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are several reasons. First, smoking is an unhealthy habit that not only does harm to smokers but hurts others health. Study shows smokers are easy to get lung cancer and others are ten times more easily to get it. So smoking is obviously should be banned. Second, smoking can cause pollution. Our country has already have cars and scooters emits, we don't need another white smoke to hurt citizens' lungs. The white smoke can also cause plants' leaves getting yellow. And if it encounter to water, it cause acid water that is unhealthy to water creatures, land animals and also concrete building. Third, smoking can damage city's tourism industry. A city with a lot of smokers may bring bad impression to foreigners. It is also not comfortable to see somebody smoke during dinner time. So smoking should not be welcomed for the city. In a nut shell, I strongly agree government to ban smoke. I consider one day, not only restaurants but all country can ban smoking.

"Have you ever experienced about a part-time job? Nowadays, lots of college students have various part-time jobs. Some students have more than 2 jobs at the same time. Then, why do they decide to do a part-time job? There are several advantages of that. The most important reason is from the fact that they can earn money by doing a part-time job. Generally, tuition of universities is so high that students may have such a burden of money. Except tuition, there might be other things to pay in their basic life, such as charge for food, transportation, or even their cell phones. In looking at these points, it becomes clear that college students need to make some money by themselves. They can solve this problem by doing a part-time job. In addition, if they work for something, they are able to become more independent. During the period of doing a part-time job, they might suffer from various situations. It could be a good chance to become a mature adult. Furthermore, they can form a personal relationship in the work place. It is really useful and essential point in every personal life.

"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Some points that the only reason that this topic is being tackled is due to the health problems that smoking causes to the non-smokers but it will be unfair to the smokers if this rule happens. First off, most if not all restaurants in the country have portions in their restaurants designated as for smokers, hence giving a place for these smokers to smoke and not affect the non-smokers. Once this rule is applied to the country, there might be an economic disaster waiting to happen because cigarette is one big portion of the country's economy. In Metro Manila alone, I believe there are two cigarette factories and if this rule happens, it will ruin the lives of the workers in these factories hence bringing less investment in our country. It will create a disastrous effect in the economy of the country because just this year, the MMDA has imposed a no smoking rule to public places. It has shut down a lot of smoking spots that lessened the buying rate of cigarettes to its consumers. Adding this other rule would drastically change the minds of its consumers and makers that it might force the makers to pull back its investments here in our country, greatly damaging the economy of the country. It won't guarantee the success of the project to lessen air pollution because it is not the cigarettes that really pollute the air but the gas from cars and factories. We may all now that cigarettes do damage the lungs especially the second hand smokers but taking out smoking in restaurants doesn't guarantee that these smokers will stop.

"I don't share the same opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. As is known to us all, smoking does great harm to the smokers and it is even more serious for those who are around the smokers. With the rise on awareness of health protection, there are sever regulations on smoking in many public places such as hospitals, airports, etc. As is the case with some restaurants. However, if we prohibit smoking in restaurant at all, there will arise many problems and inconvenience. First of all, it is unfair for those who smoke. Just like my daddy, it is so difficult for him to quit smoking that he failed doing that again and again. I know clearly how hard it is for him to spend any one more minute when he want to smoke.

Therefore, any student who thinks that having a part-time job is a bad idea is simply afraid of having to work a little bit hard or to do some great things for himself.

The highest medical authorities in the world have all concurred that smoking is killing people at an alarming rate yet is increasing year by year.

But college student is not child. They need more money than parents provide them. For example they want to play with friends, buy books, cloths, games and etc. If they have perfect free time, I think that they can work on part time job. Of course, the part time job should not be too hard to study on next day class. They can not only earn money but also can get some good things from part time jobs. For instance, they can communicate with people out of college. College students hardly talk with people out of college. And they must not be angry with customer to earn money. So part time job make them more patient. The tim e of part time job give them things that they can not learn from college.",JPN
"I don't know whether are not smoking should be banned at the restaurants in Japan because I have to admit that I don't know much about that country or its culture and therefore I feel that my opinion is not well informed enough to be taken seriously. However, when it comes to smoking in public places in general, I feel that it is better to lean towards the side of banning it. This is because smoking has wide area affects that are not contained only to the individual who are smoking. Alcohol and some drugs have over the years gone through various states of prohibition and usage, and I think that the main difference between these and tobacco comes down to the effects upon the masses. This is to say that when an individual chooses to abuse alcohol, they are really only hurting themselves (as long as they are not driving). However, a person who smokes releases harmful chemicals into the immediate vicinity and is therefore endangering the lives of people around them. Clearly, this second case is much different from the first, and people should deal with these subjects accordingly. I feel that the frequency of smoking has declined somewhat since I was a child and I think this reflects an increasing awareness of the harmful effects of smoking. One day, this knowledge will be widespread enough that smoking will be banned at all restaurants everywhere.",ENS
"Smoking is harmful, whatever the perspective you choose to stand. So I think it should be banned totally in public places. To begin with, long-term smoking is extremely dangerous to one's human body. Research has indicated that a great percentage of cancers are aroused by the toxic substances in cigarettes. Things people inhale while smoking will go through the whole body by our circulation system, and then damage our cells. It is government's duty to help preventing such things from happening. In the second place, it is well known that people are actually being compelled to smoke for a bit when they are in a smoking environment. To be frank, this is not the responsibility they have to take. They are victims. However, if smoking is not officially banned in public places, things will only get worse and those people who do not smoke simply can do nothing to help. Last but not least, people will get addicted to cigarettes; no matter they are active or passive smokers. In addition to that, public smoking indeed poses a great threat to basic civil rights and that is awful. All in all, I think smoking should totally be banned in public places.",HKG
"Everyone knows that smoking is harmful for our health. Every year, the number of people who are addicted to smoking increases sharply. Should smoking be totally banned in some public places, such as restaurants? For me, I think it is not a good idea to ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons. Each person has their own habit. I don't think it is suitable for government to interfere citizen's choice. What should our government do is helping build a particular place for people who are addicted to smoking in public places, for instance, setting a suitable space in a restaurant for people to smoke. By doing liking these, other people who don't smoke also won't be influenced. Smoking won't be banned, if people who are enjoying their meals in a restaurant are forced to stop smoking, the development of some restaurants also will be influenced. So just think the most suitable way to solve these complex problems and provide people with their own space to enjoy themselves. We can come to the conclusion, for the development of restaurants and for people's right, we should divide restaurants into different parts. Smokers can smoke in the smoking place. The others can have meals in not smoking place and not get influenced.",CHN
"Some people believe that as college students, we should not have part-time jobs as that will leave us less time on our studies, which is what our primary responsibility is. However, I agree that it is beneficial for college students to have a part-time job, if they have good time management. Firstly, getting a part-time job is the first step to learning how to be independent, and university is the best time to do so. As university course choices and education is more self-directed than in junior college or high school, most college students have much free time on their hands. Having a part-time job is thus a good way of making use of their time wisely, and earning their own income at the same time. Secondly, a part-time job can act as a bridge between college education and their careers in the future. This is especially so when their part-time job coheres with what they hope to do in the future, for example, some students may choose to take up a part-time job in healthcare institutions if their course of study is healthcare-related such as nursing, medicine or pharmacy. Their part-time jobs will allow them to get a better understanding of how the industry/organisation really works, and thus makes their learning more meaningful. Even if their part-time jobs are different from their courses of study, students will still be able to learn universal skills like teamwork, communication skills and the importance of spending money wisely that will help them in their future. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. ",SIN
"As we can see, having a part-time job becomes more and more popular among college students. From my perspective, this phenomenon is good. It is really important for college student to have a part-time job, as a part-time job may let students gain more experience, can help understand the knowledge, and can let college students know how hard can we earn money. Firstly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students may gain plenty while working. They learn how this job goes, and they learn how to work with colleagues and their boss, and also they learn to be confident. For me, I worked for a TV program as a translator for a month, and I got those I said just now. So a part-time job is really important for a college student. Secondly, it is important for college student to have a part-time job because they can practice what they have learnt in college. Practicing is the only standard for testing truth, and practice more can also help your study. When I was working for the TV program, I really learnt a lot. I have to say that all the things I learnt there was really useful. So if a college student wants to gain more go and have a part-time job. Lastly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because a part-time job can help them establish the conception of money. They will learn soon how difficult to earn even 100, and they will understand the value of money, and furthermore, they will understand their parents. In a word, college students can grow through part-time job, and they can practice more, and what is the most important, they can establish a right conception of money.",CHN
"I disagree. If it was so important then the students would do better by getting a full-time job and going to college part-time. When I paint, my focus is completely devoted to unraveling the picture that comes from with inside me. If my attention is not directed entirely at what I am doing the painting will be flawed. I believe that is the same with college studies too. When I was in college, I was completely zeroed in on completing my degree, nothing else. Because of this, I was able to do exceptionally well at everything that I did whereas, if I had to think about going to my job, then it would have been virtually impossible for me to put out my best effort. I think that it is OK if people have a part-time job because they need to, what I am saying is that I don't believe that it is important to have one just because they are at college. My parents would disagree with my point of view but that is OK and they are entitle to their opinion just as I am. I just believe that if students or anybody wants to do well in any activity, course or whatever, then they need to be there completely focused and in the moment.",ENS
"I agree with the statement that is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think that it has 3 factors. First, earning money by doing part-time jobs helps their family budget. Generally speaking, each student's family budget consists of his or her parent or parents income. Increasing family budget by doing part-time job means that increase available money. In many cases, first year student will take a great deal of money. For example, play with new friends or members of the club which he or she is belonging to make deep friendship. Especially the student who is living at an apartment house will take higher money than the former. Second, I think that main purpose of a part-time job is not only earning money but also to get chance of meeting another sex person. This is serious problem for students of the engineering faculty. For example, our English oral class consists of only men! It has no women. Because of this pessimistic situation, we should do part-time job to break down this situation and to have girlfriend. Finally, social experience maybe the most important factor. Wide view and unique imagination are essential things for engineer or any other job. To get them we have not only to learn but also to get through real. That's why I think this thema is important.",JPN
" I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, college students have grown up to be adults, having a part-time job means that they can make money to support themselves. Although the money is just part of their living expense; it is a symbol of independence. So I think it is necessary. Besides, during the process, they will get more experience, which can improve their poor social knowledge. And they have to meet kinds of people including the kind and the bad, the young and the old. Then they are sure to know what means communication and cooperation. They aren't the center in the society any more, which is not the same as living at home. They'll learn tolerance and acceptance gradually. What's more, they can acknowledge teamwork deeply. And teamwork is what they must face after they graduate. What's more, they can know their disadvantages only if they have done work actually. They will try to use what they learn in practice, and transform the theory to reality gradually. Certainly, there is a premise that part-time job shouldn't affect their study. In a word, I am in favor that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",CHN
"Smoking was never beneficial in ones ' health; this may lead to lung cancer to not only the users but also the people that surrounds them. The restaurant is for the public where the rich and the poor may interact. It is also the place where people can smoke freely. Morally speaking smoking in a public place is definitely shows no respect to others. Health wise smoking would greatly affect the people that surround it. For me, smoking in Public places like the restaurant must be banned for it shows no positive side in using such thing that would affect the people. The smokers who do not follow the law must pay the consequences. They must undergo seminars about how smoking can affect the life of many. They must also be fined with proper amount. Violators who didn't seem to learn and continuously do such action must be placed behind bars. The seemed law may seem to be too harsh for a minor mistake but a person would only learn if they don't learn it the hard way. They will continue smoking in public areas until someone like the authorities would confine them for their own actions. Smoking only leads people to sickness.",PHL
"I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have mainly two reasons and, then, I will mention why I agree. First, a lot of people who do not smoke often hate a smoke of cigarettes. At the restaurants, they have the rights of enjoying eating, and if someone is smoking near them they can not enjoy it. Since the restaurants are public place, it should be kept comfortable for everyone. Smoking sometimes makes people uncomfortable, so smoking should be banned at the public place like the restaurants. Second, a smoke of cigarettes affects not only the feelings of people who do not like smoking but also the health of everyone. If you smoke, of course it is bad for your health. In addition, it is worse for the health of people who sitting near you or serving the dishes to you. It is proved scientifically that people not who smoking but who is near smoking man are more affected in the point of the health. So smoking should be banned in order to protect the customers and the employees of that restaurant from harm of the cigarette's smoke. That is my ideas about smoking. Of course it is better that they can stop smoking by themselves at the restaurants but it is difficult, I think. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The restaurants should be comfortable place for everyone.",JPN
"Nowadays, there are more and more college students choose to have a part time job. Surely, a partime job can provide cash and working experience to them but part time job would occupy college students a lot of precious time, which should be used to learn knowledge and skills in class without worries of work stress. Also the colleges or universities like the Adamson University provide students a community to fit in the real world, so that students can develop these necessary qualities and skills. I think it's definitely not a wise option to take a part-time job in exchange of losing some parts of such important opportunities of education. It's known to almost everyone that to become a college is one of the important ways to change one's life. The main task of students is studying hard so that after graduation, they may get a good degree, which offers them a better opportunity forwell-paid jobs. they will have no longer enough time to finish homework assigned or enchance their knowledge through reading books. At the same time, they will fall behind the class schedule. In other words, part time job is responsible for students ' bad study result.",PHL
"I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned. There is no good reason for such a ban. Firstly, restaurants have good reasons to allow smokers. Some open-air restaurants have a clientele that consists of a sizeable number of smokers who smoke on its premises. This clientele are no doubt attracted by the fact that the restaurant allows them to smoke freely. On the other hand, other restaurants have a no-smoking policy. These restaurants have determined that they do not want smokers for reasons which could include: being a family-friendly place, that the management is against smoking, that the infrastructure is not catered to disperse the smoke effectively. Secondly, restaurants should have their own right to determine what their stand is on smoking. While smoking is indeed an activity that causes harm to the individual and to others who breathe in second-hand smoke, the negative consequences to others can indeed be controlled by responsible behaviour. Indeed, most restaurants that allow smoking in Singapore often designate certain spots for smokers. These rules are generally respected and followed by smokers who patronize the restaurant. This reflects a certain level of accommodation and compromise by the restaurant management, the non-smoking patrons, and the smokers. Since a stable consensus has been successfully achieved, no further action need be taken by the government. ",SIN
"SMOKING should be banned in restaurants/hotels or not? I am totally agreed with this point of view but here the question arises that how an act of an individual person can is harmful for others. Every person is independent and in the whole world there is no law of interfering in one's personal life. But one's INDEPENDENCE ENDS WHERE HIS RIGHT STARTS. It's the responsibility of a person that his act will not harmful for others. Everyone knows that smoking is less harmful for smoker or more harmful for the people sitting near him. In hotels or restaurants where people come for relaxation or enjoyment a smoker creates a bad impact. People dislike him and teenagers attract towards him, the craze of smoking develops in their minds. Smoker disturbs People by smoke while they are eating food or anything else. It also causes serious diseases. So what should we have to do in this situation? In this situation it is a responsibility of hotel management to make smoking rooms or band smoking in sitting or dinning hall. It's also the responsibility of government to assign security, police or special rangers to stop smoking in public places. This may help our environment to be clean.",PAK
"People nowadays spend their spare time useful. They make themselves productive when they have nothing to do. And make sure they earn some benefit from that thing they are up to. Best example? A Part time job. A part time job is only a temporary work in a short period of time. Well anyone can really get a part time job. Even students can get one, as long as they can do what they applied for. They work to earn some money and use it for their studies, family and etc. But most of them, they are students who are working to support their financial needs. They search for a part time job because they can't get a real job that needs all of your time. One can't give all of his/her time when he/she is studying. One won't be able to focus on their studies because of the time allotted for them to study is very short. Unlike in a part time job, you have more time in studying even if it's not that long. I really salute to those who can balance their time in studying and working. Because you can really see in them that they're willing to do anything just to study.

"Smoking is a common thing in most restaurants and other public places but should it be completely banned at all restaurants in the country? It must be banned in all restaurants because health and smoking is hazardous to other person's health, it is harmful to a pregnant and it discolours walls. In the first place, smoking is bad to other person's health. Second-hand smoke can shorten a person's life span. It causes cancers and respiratory diseases both to children and adults. Second-hand smoke has more toxic chemicals and has a higher possibility of causing cancer than the smoke a person inhales himself. In the second place, it is bad for pregnant. Smoking causes a bad effect to the woman's unborn child. If the woman inhales others smoke, she can pass the toxic chemicals that smoke carries and unwanted diseases to the unborn child. Lastly, smoking can damage the walls of the restaurant. Smoking contains toxic chemicals that can discolour the walls of the restaurant. The restaurant must look admirable to attract customers. If the walls are discoloured, it could be an added expense to the owner of the restaurant because the owner should repair the damage wall. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants because of many different reasons. Smoking can cause hazardous effects to other person's health, It is harmful to a woman's unborn child and it is destroys the walls of the restaurant. Smoking is addictive and a lot of smokers cannot stop it. Smokers should know where the right place to smoke but restaurants is definitely not the place.",PHL
"Throughout the various educational institutes, teachers generally encourage students to acquire knowledge not only by the means of a textbook, but also to gain new experiences that will help them to grow as a person. The idea of learning out of the classroom is especially important as what defines us as a person is not only what we know but also what are our values and beliefs. The primary role of a student is to study and to acquire knowledge. However, in pragmatic Singapore, the traditional view of an excellent student is that of someone who excels in academia with other areas being secondary. As such, students are expected to devote all their free time to studying for exams and not engage in other activities that may rob their time from studying. By working part-time, one will be exposed to the working society where everything is uncertain, unlike the certainty of textbooks used in colleges or universities. Such situations are good learning experiences as they present problems where the answers to it are not found in textbooks. Having nothing to rely on, one will be forced to talk to their peers and superiors to find a solution to the problem. Through such interactions, one learns much more from the lives and way of thinking from others. While I believe in the merits of obtaining knowledge through textbooks, I believe that learning through experiences is much more valuable as the experience is solely that person's and will be unique to him. The experience gained will go a long way in shaping the person's character and beliefs and ultimately the choices that he makes in life. Therefore, taking up part-time jobs as a college student is beneficial and important although not at the expense of skipping classes. ",SIN

After school, I went to a ice cream house which owned by my aunt to help her selling ice cream. Though it was tired after the job. I enjoyed it. Not because the money but the guests I met. The most impressed thing was a little boy who came with his mother. I could hear his loudly crying far from three blocks away. Surprisingly, after his hands hold ice cream tightly from my hands. He began to smile and had happiness on his face. It was such a miracle. I was totally stocked by this dramatically scene.

Firstly, as it will protect the general health of everyone in the country, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. According to the economics term, smoking is a negative externality.

It has been found that passive smoke is riskier to the people around the smoker than the person actually smoking the cigarette. This means that if there is one smoker in an air-conditioned restaurant, all the other customers will suffer from the cigarette smoke more than the person smoking the cigarette. Therefore, it is vital to protect the health of its citizens and people of the country. Also, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because this banning can act as a deterrent to all the non-smokers. If it is completely banned at all restaurants, then non-smokers will know that if they were to start to smoke, then they will have no place to eat and smoke at the same time.

That's to say. the smoking ban can help protect the health of the workers, lowering the chance of suffering from respirstory diseases and even lung cancer. What's more, the health of the general public can also be safeguarded. This is very dangerous that the non-smokers always have to suffer from the second-hand smoke of the smoking caters, especially for pregnant women and small children because their immunity is weaker. Thus, while the smoking ban is put into force, their health can also be protected. More importantly, the policy can improve the reputation of Hong Kong as a clean city. With less people smoking in Hong Kong, the air quality in Hong Kong will certainly become better. Therefore, Hong Kong will become a more attractive city for the tourists. As a result, the general image of Hong Kong as an international and healthy city will be further promoted. Conclusively speaking, there are many benefits of the policy. By prohibiting smoking at all restaurant, I am convinced our citizens' health and city's image can be improved.",HKG
"It is important for collage students to have part time job. I have two reasons. One is to make money. Collage students have much time comparing with members of society. Adults often say, I have money but no time. We can do what we want to do as far as time permitted. Therefore they need money. The other is to have many opportunities through part time job. Part time job enables us not only to make money but also to make friends, have a sense of responsibility, learn manner of society and so on. As far as for me, I have had a part time job and worked at Doughnut shop for 3 years. I work from 5:00 to 9:00 and go to school twice or three times a week. Since I started a part time job, I have changed. For example, I contact with wide range people from children to old people through part time job. I learned how to talk with each people. The skill helped me at interviews of job hunting. Consequently I could receive notice of informal decision. In case of me, I sometimes travel by money I earned. I have been to India, Australia, South Africa and so on. I had invaluable experiences there. I couldn't get such experiences by pocket money from parents. But there is one thing that I may not forget. The main work for students is not part time job but study. So students must do part time job as it doesn't interrupt study.",JPN
"Having a part-time job is important for university students. There are mainly three reasons. Students can obtain experience from having a part-time job. Most students need to work after they have graduated, and it will not be easy to work if they haven't had a job before since they have no experience. Having a part-time job is a straight-forward way for students to get some working experience. Most employers prefer students with working experience because these students can get used to the job faster. Having some part-time job experience will give students bonus when they are applying for a job. Students having a part-time job will treasure what they get from their parents. Before having a job, it is too abstract for students to understand that earning money is not easy. If a student has a job, he will know that working is not relaxing and he needs to work hard to earn money. Then he will know that his parents are not easy to earn a living and thus he will treasure what he gets from the parents. Students can earn money from part-time job. University students are adults, so they should no longer spend their parents' money. Having a part-time job is a way for them to earn what they need and they can release the heavy burden on their parents. From the above reasons, it is important for university students to have a part-time job.",HKG
"Even though some people don't worry about smoking at a public place at all, I think smoking should be absolutely banned at a public place. The biggest reason is that lots of smokers would better stop to smoke at a public place because cigarette smoke causes displeasure for someone at restaurants or other place. Even for me, when I went to school to take a class, I was not very feel good due to smoker's cigarette smoke in daejeon university campus. Besides, I believe smoking is harmful for people who smoke and don't smoke. According to a research, cigarette is not good for people health. We know this fact very well, however many smokers don't stop to smoke on their own. Finally, I personally hope a lot of smokers don't stop to smoke as soon as possible. Moreover, smoking rates increase more and more. Therefore, smoking is quite serious problem in modern society. Also, a lot of smokers don't stop to smoke due to cigarette's toxic. In my opinion, I wish many smokers don't smoke somewhere. I think cigarette is not welcome by nonsmokers somewhere. For these reasons, I believe that it is should be banned to smoke at restaurants.",KOR
"I opposed smoking at the restaurants room. Because I am non-smoker. The dining room is not the place where the individual is alone. There are others people, such as restaurant. People have a right to eat and clean place. Do not give harm to others people. The restaurant has children. There are also non-smokers. Secondhand smoke to children and pregnant women are not very good. Cigarettes smoke contains the bad ingredients. The ingredients will adversely affect the human body. Cause lung cancer and various complications. Cigarette smoke is bad influence to the fetus. Cigarette ash blowing in the wind could get into food. Will harm others people. For the most part non-smokers do not like the smell of cigarettes. If you smoke, an enclosed place is not awakening. As an unpleasant smell to eat. Non-smokers will have a meal while you feel uncomfortable. Eliminates the smell of cigarette taste Trouble is the results that provide. Due to the smokers that the damage that other people should be prevented. Smoking in restaurants should be prevented. Smokers should smoke in outdoor. Is not harmful to others people. Cigarette is very bad for your health. Harm to self and others, will harm. So let us stop smoking.",KOR
"Nowadays, there exist a great number of college students doing part-time job during their free time. Some are for experience, and the others are for money actually. For me, my mother doesn't allow me to do that, she emphasizes again and again, 'we can provide you with absolutely enough money for, and just fix all of yourself on your major and your activities!' While I don't agree with this and I really want to do part-time job after class. As far as I concerned, to begin with, it is strong tendency that college students kill their free time by hanging on internet, so having part-time job to do can make us more active and make full use of our campus life. What's more, in my opinion, social life and campus life are totally different. A part-time job can be a real and convenient way for us to touch the society while in campus, which avoids us being too puzzled and frustrated after graduating. Last but not the least, little is better than nothing. We will gain some money more or less so that we can treat ourselves while enjoying the satisfactory. So I agree it a pretty good idea to have a part-time job when in college.",CHN

They can find the pocket money and met many people from a part-time job, because it can make a good experience for you life and abilities of the free-time.",THA
"I agree with this opinion. I think smoking should be completely banned at all Japanese restaurants. The reason is that no matter where it is the public place, I think that smoking should completely be banned. And now the place is especially restaurants. In there, many people who are smoker or non-smoker are eating meals. And they are having a fun to eat or to talk with friends. So smoking lead to non-smoker having uncomfortable feelings. Indeed, if I were a smoker, I wouldn't want to ban to smoke at any place. But, I think that it important to ban to smoke for non-smoker, because of passive smoking. It means that non-smoker can smoke, if there is a smoker near to non-smoker. The material which passive smoking includes is more dangerous than one which direct smoking dose. If there is such a thing for a long time, non-smoker may have a cancer even if they have never smoked yet. So smoking near to non-smoker may be dangerous to smoke for non-smoker. This passive smoking can be at everywhere smoking people are, and now the place is in door so it can be more dangerous because of too near to non-smoker people. There are some reasons that I think smoking should be completely banned at all Japanese restaurants.",JPN
"I believe that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. First, as university students must pay the expensive tuition and use money for lunch or transport fee, so, they can do a part time job to lighten the burden of their family. Moreover, having a part time job can get some experiences. The university students can choose the part time job that can help them to prepare their future career. These experiences can widen their view. For example, if they be a tutor of the primary student or secondary student, they can learn how to teach children and how to prepare material for the children during the lessons. In addition, being a university student is not same as a secondary student, so, doing the part time job is a addition task for university students to arrange their time table. In the university, there are some job for them to do, for example, being a librarian or being a helper of some program. They should use these few years to learn how to arrange their time table that not same as secondary school. In conclusion, having a part time job is important for university students.",HKG
"A college student is someone who is undergoing tertiary education. This means that besides from the school fees that the college student and his family have to pay, there are still other expenses like stationary fees, clothes, textbooks and laptops. There will also be other expenses incurred when the student decided to join events like the Overseas Community Involvement Program (OCIP). Therefore, it is important that college students have a part time job. Having a part time job can also help the students to learn more about effective communication with other people. For example, if the student is working part time at Macdonalds, he will learn how to treat the customers with respect and how to carry out proper customer services. This will benefit the student if he was to work in the service sector after he has graduated. Working part time during school days will also help the student to gain an edge as compared to his counter-parts during job interviews next time. Employers are more likely to hire people with prior working experiences rather than just a fresh graduate who knows nothing about the society and how to serve people. Part time jobs can help the students to learn how to be street smart and deal with issues like customers complain. However, having a part time job will means that the weekends and maybe weekdays of the student will be taken up. This will results in the student being unable to have time for himself and his friends, as well as to catch up on schoolwork. His studies will then be affected. ",SIN
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for three reasons. First, as you know, smoking is bad for your health. Even if you like smoking, you ought to reduce smoking. The law against smoking will be a chance for you to stop smoking during meals. Second, many people have dishes in restaurants. Though some of them may like smoking too, but others don't like it. You may say that these days more and more restaurants separate between smoking seats and no smoking ones. But smoke widen throughout the floor. Moreover, you can do harm much heavily in case children are there. Both physically and mentally, children are more effective than adults. It may inhibit them from growing! And of course you can't easily make up for it. You will get many responsibilities by smoking in public. Third, smoking prevents you from tasting dishes. It's a pity that even though good chefs give you delicious plates, you wouldn't be able to feel anything special. It's also rude for the chefs. In the ends, by smoking you have a fun only for a second, and after that you will get many problems. I hear that many countries in the world have already banned smoking in public. They widely announce that smoking is a cause of many diseases. In Japan there are less strict against smoking now. But weather strict exist or not, you should stop smoking such places like restaurants where many people are.",JPN
"Nowadays, many college students have a part-time job. There are various part-time jobs. For example, Convenient store, bar, restaurant, gas station, department store and so on. Many students go to work part-time after school. We need to see whether these part-time jobs have a good effect on college students. There is no reason to oppose working a part-time job. I suggest college students should have put motive of part-time job not earning money but getting hands-on experience. Part-time job is paid hourly. So it is difficult for students to make a lot of money. Time can be spending easily. It isn't desirable for students to earn much money, because they have to do much work. Younger days Time is also very important. I agree that hand-on experience is more effective than lecture-based learning. On account of part-time job, many college students can learn the society and be a wise man. Thanks to part-time job, many college students can learn socialization. They actually do a part-time job and earn money. This process makes the students find a real society. Earning money do college students good. Because earning money is difficult, student save money. Owing to diver's experience, students can learn to be sociable. Part-time job help people realize labor relation, the ways of the world. But, it is desirable to keep out of the way when students study major. I am of the opinion that Students should not forget duty as a student. Simple real experience made our live stimulate and have a good impact on ours. But above all, Study is more important than part-time job. Personally, I think that part-time job is useful in regard to sociality and various hands-on experiences. What it comes down to that it is important that part-time job should fit in study.",KOR
"Some people hold the view that smoking should be forbidden in public places. However others stand on the opposite side, thinking it's much to strict. As far as I am concerned, I support the former. The reasons are as follows. First and foremost, it is commonly acknowledged that smoking do great damage to smokers' health and even make smokers have lung cancers. Since there is no good to smoke, why do people smoke and even can be allowed to smoke in public places? Besides, when a person smoke in public places, people around him, including infants and the old, have to breathe the smoke air given off by the cigarette. In some public places which are indoor and only have limited space, such as libraries and restaurants, the damage smoking do must be greater because the polluted air stay inside instead of going out. Last but not least, cigarette butts and thick smoke may probably lead to a big fire, destroying public facilities, such as buildings, parks, libraries, theatres and so on. From all these reasons raised, we can come to the conclusion that smoking should be banned in public places, not only for ourselves and people around us but also for public safety.",CHN
"I agree with this statement, this is one of good choice for student with low economy, because it can help his income, his school fee or daily necesssary. But i think it is not only for low economic student, but also suitable for every student. They can practice how they can feel real of work before they take a part in work society. Based on the reason above, if they want to take a part time job, it is important consider for them to balance between campus activity and part time job. If we can divide between campus activity and part time of job well, so the result will be good. I will give some example for job part time. First, almost of student who take a part time of job is teaching, or private course, it is not heavy but we have to consider it well, for example, we just take a part in spent time, which has 1, 5 hour in one meeting, so it is not too heavy. Beside of it, we can learn from the content. The second example, we can join in shopping centre, surely it is not too heavy to ourself, for example we can become a waitress or shop officer. Finally, if we take a part real at work next time, we will have a confidence, because we feel how become a worker. We can share/work in group well.",IDN
"It is a caution written on every packet of cigarette by the ministry of health. Almost every person knows how much a cigarette is injurious for health and in a long run how much it is going to effect a smoker physically. Even then almost 30% of world's population is addicted of this bad habit which is a big ratio. Today, when smoking is becoming a status symbol for the college students and teenagers they use to smoke outside in their private parties. On the other hand today parents are very well aware of after effects of this addiction and they restricts their children to do any this type of activity very strictly. As the result of this condition from the parents side youngsters use to go out and smoke in privacy with their friends in restaurants or cafe's where they could not be spotted by their elders, this trend is very common today. It is very famous saying that' nature cannot be changed' and it is also understood that a habit leads to one's nature. That means if today's child do smoke and not stopped will undoubtedly remain with this habit whole his life, at the end conclusion is that smoking of a person is not the problem of an individual but national or global so it should be banned every where outside like hotels and restaurants. In this way we can get rid of this very serious problem.",PAK
"Become a college student is a development from a child to a mature. Many changes happen in this period. More parents don't give any money to the college student. They want their children be a mature and have responsibility to theirself, include their economics need. As we know, college student have a lot of needs. To buy something for their study until their lifestyle need. It spends a lot of money. So, they must have a job to earn money. But the college schedule often make them confuse, how to earn money without leave their study. Study is important, but there is nothing without money. It must balance both works and study. Part time job is one option. Because they can earn money and study at the same time. They can focus on study when they are in the college and focus on their work in spare time. For example, become a part time teacher, to help elementary student study. Of course, this job can't do in the same time, because to teach a student need concern and focus. The benefit is they can arrange learning schedule with the college schedule at the evening, so do not disturb their activities at the college but can earn money.",IDN
"In this time of tough job market, we need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to field of study, will give an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that have had some real-world, adult experiences and that can handle yourself outside of campus. Aside from making more employable after college, having a part-time job will help financially. A part-time job can help pay for living expenses, including food, books, things, and clothes. This way, not overwhelmed with monthly payments when find self working a much lower paying job than you had hoped for right after college. Taking on financial responsibility also takes some of the load off of my parents' shoulders if they are helping me with my expenses. Parents will not be around forever, and so you have to gradually become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner begin this process, the easier it becomes and the faster become 100% independent financially. Therefore I agree that it is important for a college student to have a part time job.",IDN

"Part time job is a job that did not need many time and suitable for people who are studying. It could increase your earning with simple job. College life is not same with high school.

"According to the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, I fully agree. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for health and the problem that why youths pick up smoking is because of peer influence and they think that it is ""cool"". Banning smoking in more areas will tend to make smokers think twice before lighting up their cigarettes and makes youth to think twice if they want such a miserable life to always be finding for a place to smoke while their peers are hanging and chilling out at the restaurant whereby they are in a small corner smoking alone and missing out the fun. Ban smoking in restaurants will also make parents such as maybe the father or mother whom smokes but because of their kids love this particular restaurant, they will have to forgo their urge to smoke and slowly eventually quit smoking for good. Hence, banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country might be a good thing to curb the smokers' population and to create barriers to entry for the new smokers hence the population of smokers will decline and this will be a more well off social environment for the younger generations.

"Smoking has been a controversial issue for a long time since it not only does harm to people's health, but also cause pollution, crimes and other serious problems. At the mention of whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, there has never been an agreement among people. Some people firmly support the ban considering the disadvantages of smoking while others think that smoking can be allowed in the restaurants under some specific circumstances as long as the policy is purposely carried out. Personally speaking, I hold the view that smoking shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, there are a great number of people dining out in restaurants everyday. Most of them have the habit of smoking or need to smoke while having business talk with their clients in the restaurants. If they are banned from smoking in these situations, their business will be affected and they will feel so unsatisfied that they may no longer eat in some restaurants which can lead to a lot of bankruptcy and unemployment. Secondly, since people aren't allowed to smoke in the restaurants, they may find other public places to smoke. Even if bans are carried out at all the restaurants, they may still smoke in any public places such as parks, buses, stores and so on. This vicious circle will do an even greater harm to our environment. Last but not least, a complete ban from smoking at all the restaurants is financially unrealistic. The revenue of selling cigarettes greatly contributes to a country's economy every year. In summary, smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country for several social and financial reasons. But that doesn't mean the complete permission is feasible. I think we should establish some specific areas at the restaurants for people to smoke. That will not only relieve the problem of pollution to some extent, but also promote the economic growth of our country.",CHN
"Many college students now are considering taking a part-time job, especially for the freshmen, who have amount of time and energy. In my opinion, taking a part-time job broadens our horizon and brings us a lot of fundamental skills in life. So I agree with the opinion that taking a part-time part is important for college students. I have the following reasons and arguments to support my view. On the one hand, Chinese students are always considered as hard-working examples but it seems that we lack the power to practice. Taking a part-time job, during which we can learn how to communicate, work and live with people in society, is beyond peradventure good for our growing. College life must be more than just study and we should focus more on personal development. On the contrast, a student who spends all his time just reading books and finishing homework, no matter how academic his, may not be admitted by companies. Those students are not as mature as these who have experience in jobs after graduation. So why not take a part-time job? We all should take the chance of the days without too much homework and take a part-time job to develop ourselves.",CHN
"Every man has its own perspective view regarding to smoking. According to me it should be banned in all public places and in all restaurants. Because the restaurants are those places where the people comes and take relaxation and enjoys drinking eatings and smoking and etc. But smoking is very bad habit and has very dangerous effects on human health. But there is the thing that should smoking be banned in restaurants? I think it depends on the owner's of restaurants. Either they permit it or not. But one thing should be in our mind that numbering of flint areas of smokers are increasing day by day. Number of smokers have been increased. In 2005 there were 27. 6 percent smokers, and in 2007 there were 31. 1 percent but yet there are 71 percent. According to scientists say that it should be banned. Now there are some main reasons due to which smoking should be banned. One thing is that restaurants are the public places. Where the different kinds of people and families comes with their childrens for enjoyments. And at the same time there are some smokers and non smokers also there. When the smokers smoke then the non smokers are exposed to do the same. Which is very bad thing. Passive smokers are exposed to smoking. This also a big reason that's why smoking should be banned in restaurants. Families comes there with childrens and childrens are exposed to do the same. This is also a reason. All the restaurants will stuffy due to smoke. There will be no fresh air in restaurants, which is very harmful for human life. Then the people will suffered in different kinds of heart diseases. Protect the non smokers from smokers. Non smokers can suffer in different kinds of disease like nausea, due to the absence of fresh air in restaurant. That's why smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Due to all these things smoking should be banned in all restaurants.",PAK
"Part time job is very important for college students. The statement was made based on my own reason. First, have a part time job will be useful for us one day in the future. We could learn how to earn our own money, how to manage our income, and many other things so the time we have will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part time job could reduce our family's financial problem even if it's just a little. Second, we must admit, sometimes, the money that is transferred monthly by our parents is not enough for our daily need. Earning money by ourselves will be a very helpful thing so we won't burden our parents by asking more money. They also can't complain about how we are going to use it because it's the money that we earn, so we have the right to manage it by ourselves. Last but not least, part time job helps us to be independent. It gives us experience to handle the problems we will face in our full time job in the future. It also helps us to learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, or how to handle the problems those occurred by them. It's also easier to find a job if we have the experience to work for the other people. For example, if we ever had a job and want to find a new job, our chance to be accepted is higher than the ones who never have a job at all. So I conclude that having a part time job is very important for college students.",IDN
"You should not smoke at restaurants in Japan. Because smoking is not match with restaurants. First how places are restaurants? They are the spaces where people enjoy meal, without disturbance from others; however you also should not disturb others. You can talk with your friends, use cellular phone and do your homework, but you must not make a loud voice or sound there. Next what does smoking cause? Of course, cigarettes make smoke. It makes people feel unpleasant in many ways. Its smell is very bad; besides, it includes harmful matter for human body. A lot of people know the fact and almost all of them dislike the harmful smoke. Some feel unpleasant though they only see the smoke. That is to say, smoke from cigarettes can bother people. From the above, it is natural you should not confuse the two factors, restaurant as place and smoking. Nowadays, many restaurants have provided both smoking area and no smoking area. They have believed that customers were not disturbed by any smokers because they kept distance each other. But the fact the two factors have been confused in the same space is not good. That idea is wrong. So, all the restaurants in the country should completely ban smoking.",JPN
"I agree with the idea that we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, smokers have the right to smoke, but they should not smoke in the place which smokers may trouble other people. Especially when other people are eating, the smoke makes other people have unwillingness to eat. I change my seat if there is smoker near me when I am eating. Besides, there is another problem. In the restaurant, there is place for smokers and for non smokers. We can choose the room we like to sit down, but in the almost all restaurants, there is nothing to have smoke kept in the room for smokers. As a result, the smoke comes to the room for non smokers. It is obvious that choosing the room is meaningless. Furthermore, cigarette smoke harm people who do not smoke. There are many researches which improve cigarette smoke will cause many kinds of illnesses. It can cause cancer which may kill people. Some foreign countries have already started to ban the cigarette in the public, such as school, station, airport and also restaurant. Japan has to ban smoking at all restaurants, too.",JPN
"Experience is the best teacher A quote I always hear from the elders. Students usually think of having their own income. Isn't it so evident that we go to college so we will have our own source of income in the future? In our school, we often thought of it too. I agree on students having a part time job. Having a job is a hard task. You should be responsible enough in order to do it. Mind setting is also important. If you only think of just the money you will get then it is not worth it. College student who have part time jobs should be the successful professionals someday, I suppose. It's because they already know how it like is to work for your own. Like the quote said, experience teaches you. Even on how you control your money. As early as college time, you should already have a part time job, a job not only for the sake of money but for the learning also. So it will not be so hard for you to adjust after you graduated. It's like your training grounds for the future. So this I must say, I agree on us, students, having part time job. Even organizational job is included. You should be busy always, go out on your comfort zone and learn from it. Experience will teach you anyway.",PHL
"I agree with the question. I have four reasons. First of all, I think it is important for university students to experience before getting a job. For example, if students who are finished university get a job and have to hardly work, they cannot accurately work. That is because they have not enough experiences. In my case, Part time job is important to many university students. Doing part time job help more grow up man. And get a confidence. I spend waste money. So I always no money. Every day I have loan and sad mind. Near my friends, some guy never do part time job. And he provides all money from his parents. He spends money buying something. I lose memories with my friends. I was busy during part time job and I studied many things... I can't play with my friends. That was so sad. But I learned many things. My friends said 'you are very independence. I want to learn your ability.' I was very happy. I think I am growing. I was very shy person. But Through many experience about society I changed very activity person. I really thankful that. I can change. And I want to be a good salesperson.",KOR
" Nowadays, part-time job is more and more fashion among the senior high school students and college students. In my opinions, I think it is a very good phenomenon and should be encouraged in our society. Almost of the college students are beyond 18 years old, which means that they have the ability to feed themselves. I think having a part-time job in vacations a excellent chance for us to make some money. These will reduce parents' burden and make yourself feel good and successful. When using the money you earned by yourself, you would feel proud and relaxable. It is also a lesson that tell you making money is not easy as you image. You should make a lot of effort to make money which you think is so little. Then you will be more thrifty and won't use money promiscuous. The most important is that you will get a lot of experiences, which will lead you be more skillful. Experience is so important which can't be measured by money. It is so precious that will give a powerful hand to your future. We will find a job easier than those who haven't any experiences and could avoid so many mistakes which rookies are always make. To conclude, whatever for now or future, it is very necessary for us to have a part-time job when we are idle.",CHN
"Where there is air, there is smoking. Though the terrible effect of smoking is already known to every adolescence and adult, there is never a trend that smoking will disappear. Yet, we should still insist that less smoking is better for our life after thinking about why the trend exists. The very first step is again to speak medical side effects of smoking. Not only will smoking will damage the lung tissue in the body, the polluted air, which contains nicotine, further interferes the persons around the smoker. The second-handed smoke now has been proved to be more harmful. We could say that if the legal system were more strict, the smoker could have been sued for millions times. But why there is no trend that smoking will disappear?  Firstly, it is because of the extravagant profit from the cigarette industry. As it is the retained profit for those cigarette companies, there is rare chance that they will give up the opportunities to earn the money. Secondly, the customers will use the cigarettes as gifts so that they can show their preference for others. Some will also think the cigarettes symbolise their social status. In another word, the market of cigarette trade still maintains intact. Thirdly, smokers will just get addicted to smokingâ€”that is the most troublesome. As long as these reasons exist, the people's life will be affected for one more day, and more happiness will be deprived of. So, let's act to reduce the use of cigarette, and there will be less annoyance resulting from smoking.",CHN
"Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Many smokers would assert that smoking in restaurants is their private business, and as long as it is not illegal, they have the rights to do it. Be that as it may, this seemingly strong argument would probably far from being valid as they intentionally omit the prerequisite of freedom: their actions cannot intrude into others' freedom as well. Non-smokers also have the rights of not inhaling the stale cigarette smoke given out by smokers and they may feel uncomfortable when the air around them is bad. Moreover, passive smoking may affect the health of other customers in restaurants because the cigarette smoke is proved to contain a high concentration of carcinogenic chemicals. For this reason, it is a must to ban smoking in restaurants. Also, if smoking is allowed in restaurants, some chief and waters may smoke in their working environment. In some cases, the smoking residue may fall into the food to be delivered to customers. The contaminated food is not hygienic at all and when people intake it, they may easily get sick. Thus, for the same of the health of the public and hygienic issues, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.",HKG

If they work for part time job, they maybe no time to read book. Most of part time job is limited; they have to do at least 6 hours per day. Actually, the college students have learnt for 3 hours a day. So they don't have enough time to prepare or review their daily lesson. It's OK if you don't review it regularity but for Mid-term test or final test. You must have time for reviewing. If some college students do part time job, surely they must be tired from their working and they can not attend the class in the morning. Unfortunately, if they get hurt from their work and are sent to hospital they have to stay for a week and can not follow their friends in class.

"Nowadays, more and more college students choose to do a part-time job during their university life. For the reason that the tuition in the university is very expensive, and it will burden the pressure on our parents. In my opinion, it is a good choice for the college students especially for someone is encountering economic problems. As a college student, we have a lot of free time; why not make full use of them to do a part-time job. There are lots of advantages to do a part-time job. It can not only help students promote their study through their part-time jobs, but also can offer us an opportunity to go beyond what we have been taught in class, and we will learn more knowledge in practice. In addition, students can also accumulate work experience through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job hunting. Actually, part-time job also plays an important role after we graduate from school and help us prepare for our future careers. It is easier to find jobs for those who have work experience in part-time jobs. In conclusion, it is important for college students to take part-time jobs. As long as it won't cause a negative effect on our study, choose an appropriate part-time job is a wise choice for college students.",CHN
"I agree very strongly with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. The recent trend worldwide is for smoking in public places to be banned - and there are good reasons for this. Chief among these is that through second-hand smoke, smoking is dangerous for everyone - not just smokers. This is especially a concern for restaurant workers. It is unfair to expect people to have to work in this kind of environment, but without a ban, restaurant employers will continue to demand their employees work in smoke-filled restaurants and employees will have no choice but to accept or face losing their jobs. Smoking in restaurants is not just bad for restaurant employees, it is also a massive inconvenience for non-smoking patrons of the restaurant too. Whether there is a smoking area or not makes little to no difference, because smoke travels. People go to restaurants expecting to enjoy good food, but instead find their enjoyment is spoiled because they can only smell smoke - not the food. Of course, at first, restaurant owners would be likely to oppose a ban. Just like in other countries where a ban has been brought in, it can be expected that they will argue that their sales will suffer. But, like in other countries, they would soon see the benefits of a smoke-free environment. Their employees would be healthier and happier and non-smokers would come to restaurants in droves. Smokers too, would soon realize that going outside or to a special smoking room is a small price to pay to enjoy smoke-free food. In short, a smoking ban really would be the best for everyone.",ENS

"Recently, there is a hot debate arouse whether taking a part-time job will benefit university students or not. Some people who advocate the opinion of having a casual job believe that it helps the students in not only financial terms but also mental aspects. Other people argue that it is too hard for them to allocate the time to balance between study and work. In this essay, it will discuss both of advantages and disadvantages of having a part-time job. Firstly, there are various advantages to work part-time for university students who will get into the outside world soon after graduation. The experience of working during study will make them better equipped with not only academy from the school but also practice from working experience. It will also give freedom from financial dependency on their parents, even though the amount of money they earn is not quite a lot, that will take off some burden from their parent's shoulder. Secondly, the most important output would be learning social skills by confronting or dealing with outside people. Through this kind of experience, university students will learn some skills that they cannot learn from the textbooks. Interacting with people outside will provide them with a greater confidence and opportunities to see real world. People standing against the arguments, however, claims that the most of students will fail to allocate their time properly on balancing between study and work. Moreover, interacting with their peer students is very crucial while they are still developing their characteristics. For example, having a money mind that thinks everything in terms of money value will ignore some valuable things in life, such as teaching poor children for free or volunteer work for underdeveloped countries. In conclusion, in my opinion, advantages of part-time working outweigh the disadvantages greatly. However, we still cannot ignore the negative effects so we should try to minimize the disadvantages to the least extent without sacrificing advantages.",KOR
"But because there are many hidden benefits to having a part-time job, I think that many students stand to benefit by having one. For example, I work at the rec center, and as a result I spend a lot of time thinking about health and fitness and how to become stronger, faster, and more fit. Most of my coworkers are the same way, and most of us have a very high level of fitness. This is the hidden benefit that I was talking about. Not only do we have a good job at a fun place on campus, we can learn about how to be healthy and we can have a place where we can do all the things we need to do to stay fit. In the same way, there are different in benefits to different part-time jobs. For example, if you work at a pizza restaurant, you can learn how to make pizza and you can also eat as much as you want to, although that might be bad for you. Every part time job has a hidden benefit that you can take advantage of if you only take the small effort to think about all the things you are doing and how you can work on those things to benefit yourself as well.",ENS

"A part time job is a job in which an employee does not work full hours. Employment in a part-time job has advantages and disadvantages which need to be carefully weighed when one is considering employment options. Typically, an employment announcement or job vacancy listing will indicate whether a position is full or part time, as the number of hours offered is important to many people. Part time jobs may also be referred to as part time employment, or PTE. A part time job often has the advantage of more flexible hours. Sometimes employees can at least partially dictate their own schedules, thereby setting up a job which is in alignment with life and other needs. Part-time jobs may also offer benefits such as discounts to employees, and in some regions of the world, as long as employee works at least half time, he or she is eligible for other employee benefits as well. These benefits may include sick pay, insurance, payments into pension funds, or vacation time. In other cases, these benefits are not offered; this is one of the biggest disadvantages of a part time job. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. Working part time is ideal for students, since it allows them to balance their academic needs with their school needs. Often, a school will provide a list of available part time jobs for the benefit of students, and many college towns deliberately tailor their openings for students.",IDN
"I disagree with the above statement. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants as it is a personal right that smokers be allowed to do as they wish, as long as they are not negatively affecting others excessively. Non-smokers may argue that smoking produces negative externalities. This means that although they themselves are not smoking, they are forced to breathe in the second-hand cigarette smoke that smokers exhale, which is harmful to their health. They are suffering at the expense of the smokers, and because of this, they might propose for smoking to be banned at all restaurants. Even though restaurants in Singapore have allocated smoking areas, non-smokers often complain that the cigarette smoke travels to other areas. However, this argument is not valid as if smoking were to be banned in all restaurants, it would be fair to ban families with babies from dining at all restaurant too. This is because babies that cry create negative externalities, by disturbing tables nearby with the noise. Similarly, it would also be fair to ban someone with body odour from the restaurant s, as he or she would be causing others to suffer for no reason. Thus, we cannot ban smoking in all restaurants as if we were to do so, we would have to ban anyone who causes inconvenience to other diners, and this would create an non-exhaustive list of offenders.

"The poverty in the Philippines decreases rapidly, due to the lack of education and unemployment given to the people. With the new program made by the Aquino Administration, the burden of the marginalized Filipino families in making their children study worsened. Practically not only the parents should work for their children's education but also the children themselves. Due to the new curriculum given by the government, this would enable the students to work while studying. In my opinion, it is important for the student to work while having his education because they tend to learn more through experiences. Works just don't give salary for the working students; they also give sufficient experiences that the students can apply to their academics. On the other hand, the student might find it hard to balance education to their work. They may end up focusing on their jobs that they might be able to forget to study for their academics. However, this experience could help the student's to learn how to manage their time that may help them and grow to a more matured individual. Education would always be important to a person; it would always depend on the student whether or not they would help their parent with their own education.",PHL
" As is we all known, smoking does harm to our health. It is so normal to see a man or a woman smoking in public place. I don't know why so many people like to smoke everyday.

"It has been a controversy on smoking in a public place for a long time between smokers and non-smokers. In Korea, smoking is now banned at most public places, such as inside of a building or a restaurant. However, there are still a lot of places, especially, restaurants, have a smoking area for their customers. Smokers say that they have a right on smoking and it should be respected. Yet, I strongly claim that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Korea for several reasons. First, smoking at a restaurant causes the victims by secondhand smoking. While some restaurants have a smoking area separated from non-smoking area, most restaurants have it, but not separated. Consequently, it causes of making the secondhand smoking environment and exert a bad influence upon the health of non-smokers. Restaurant is one of typical public places opens for everyone includes children. To them, secondhand smoking is fatal on their health. If smoker claim for the right of smoking to be respected, the right of non-smokers to breathe fresh air should be guarantee as well. Second, it causes children to have a wrong perception of smoking and be a potential smoker. Childhood is the time to learn anything very fast and get used to what they see. If they are exposed on adults smoking, they would be easily getting used to it. Moreover, they might get a wrong perception think that smoking is cool, so try to smoke in the end. Once children get used to it and fixed on their mind, it is hard to change it. This is why smoker should not insist their right on smoking at a public place. In conclusion, smoking should be banned at the all restaurants in our country because of its bad influence on the health of non-smokers and on children mentally. Smokers do not deserve to threaten the right of non-smokers.",KOR
Part time job means the job done in the spare time other than the regular task. At can also be termed as the job of preference. In modern life style part time job become compulsion to fulfill the financial need of person. Sometime part time job is done to help the cause of first priority. It is the worse side of modern life style that the man is never satisfied with what he has. Few people do part time job with their consent to use their potential in positive side. But most of people do this of the people do this to satisfy their financial needs. The man 21st century has become materiality in his approach. He visualizes everything in material aspects and cares for profit and less in every matter. He do part time job to get better facilities and to enjoy good life but while doing this he loses his efficiency and become a machine. in doing so it is rare chance that he would enjoy life. he thinks that only way to survive in the society is to earn more and more but in doing so he not only spoils his health but also loses the social life. he has no time to stand and stare and enjoy the natural aspects of life. I think that part time job should be done only if you enjoy your work and want to do something which help your cause of first priority. but it should not done to fulfill material alsikes only because the wishes keep on growing and never be fulfill. A man should be contorted with what he has and should strive for a reasonable and respectable status in society. He should be blind in earning wealth.,PAK

"Smoking has been an issue for a long time already. There is no question that cigarettes are only good for doing harm, but banning smoking at all the restaurants is not a good idea. Rather it's good or not, it is one of the favorite foods. Before we unconditionally ban smoking and advocate non-smoker, we also need to consider the smoker's right. It would be good if there are seats for smokers only. To separate the seats into two kinds, for smoker and non-smokers, can be one solution which is already happening in Korea. If you visit cafè¾¿ or restaurants, you can easily find the seats separated. I think this is the better idea than banning smoking all the areas at restaurants. And it is also good to make a smoking area outside of the restaurants buildings so that the people can smoke and non-smokers don't get harmful effect. My opinion is that we don't have the right to stop smokers so smoking should be allowed. But a guideline or a condition must be followed which is saying ""Smoker should not affect non-smoker.

"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with this opinion because smoke is dangerous for everyone who breathes it not only who is smoking. The smog is composed of many hazardous chemical substants. I used to know that there are more than 500 dangerous substants in smog. Moreover, the restaurant is the place where people go there to have meal. So, if someone smokes, the smog could make other people, who are eating, mad because of its smell and also destroy their health, too. Customers may be don't want to go that restaurant again. I think the government have to launch the law about this problem not only in the restaurant but also in the school and public places. In addition, smoke could cause unpredictable situation such as fire etc. So banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is the good solution but it's ought to hard to do because many people like to smoke after had meal. But, I think if all restaurants can do it, it must be good for customers and image of the country. And other country can use this idea to develop their country, too.",THA
"As is known to us all, college is a place where people look for further education, exchange their academic ideas and finally both enrich their selves for their future career in society and propel the development of all endeavors of society. However, college is not equal to society. College students need opportunities to get in touch with those things beyond campus and accumulate enough practical experiences for their future careers. It is precisely the part-time job that gives such opportunities to college students. Serving in restaurants, working as an intern secretary for a company, or being a salesman selling commodities on short-term sale etc., no matter what part-time job a college student chooses to participate in, she will learn practical skills to adjust to society which academic-centered college cannot teach her. Besides, it should be taken into consideration that part-time jobs do offer a certain amount of money to college students, making some financial income for college students' daily life or even helping them to afford their college study. One of my high school classmates went to a college in Singapore for further education after his graduation, in the first year, his family offered his nearly $15, 000 for study and living expense. Now he is in his senior year, with his part-time job income of nearly $250 per month on average, he will save at least $2, 000 for his family when he get his bachelor degree.

"I do support the idea of college students working part-time, or even full-time for that matter for the following reasons. To begin, I believe by working it teaches students many valuable lessons about life that will also be a part of his/her educational process. One of those lessons to learn is about the value of money. Most kids of college age do not fully understand the value of money, as they have been given almost everything they have, without any REAL knowledge of the costs. Nor do they understand all the efforts someone had to make to pay for those things. Another good life-lesson that working provides is having a better understanding of responsibility. Being responsible for some, or all of the costs of one's education will hopefully tie-in with understanding the value of money; in addition, for having responsibility for one's own success, as well as failure. Depending on our own disciplines to achieve success is one of the greatest assets a person can have to obtain control of one's desires. Too often young people depend on others to see to it that their lives are on the right track. This, in my opinion is unfortunate because if we are so spoiled and have things done for us, or have everything paid for us without any effort, I believe we do not acquire the much-needed respect for people, time, money, or responsibility, not to mention many other aspects of being responsible for one's self that were not mentioned in these opinions.",ENS

So the behavior influences people's feeling and cause some complaint. In their view, we should ban smoking in the restaurant. In my opinion, I'm in favor of banning smoking in the restaurant too.

Of course, you can smoke, it's your right, but you can consider firstly other's feelings. Second-hand smokers suffer more harmful than those smokers. Worse more, there are all kinds of person, such as children, the old people, some pregnant women and so on, are in the restaurant having their meals. The smell of cigarettes must have negative effect on them. Originally, we can have a good time with our family to have a dinner. Finally, we cannot enjoy ourselves due to smoking in the restaurant.

"I think that smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the country. Recently, I often hear the word nonsmoking everywhere. I think that smoking should be forbidden at place where a lot of people are because the cigarette smoke affects our health. Even if we don't smoke a cigarette, our bodies receive the harm if there is a person who is smoking a cigarette around us. Above all, it is said that children are more likely to receive the harm, and there are many children in restaurants. There are a lot of harmful things we receive by smoking cigarette or breathing cigarette smoke from the cigarette which the person around us smokes. There are some people who don't like the smell of cigarettes. I don't like it, too. People go to a restaurant to enjoy eating dishes. I think people enjoy the smell of dishes, too. If a person smokes a cigarette in a restaurant, people who enjoy eating dishes around there couldn't enjoy the smell of dishes. Of course, there are many people who smoke cigarette. Such people would have troubles if smoking is banned at all restaurants. But there are many people who don't smoke cigarettes, too. I think people who want to smoke cigarettes have to smoke outside.",JPN
"It seems that every college student wants a part-time job nowadays, which I think is not necessary. No one can deny the fact that doing a part-time job makes you nearer to the real world. Without having their parents to depend on for advice and guidence, fresh men need to improve their abilities of living and deciding things by themselves. At the same time, gaining some work experiences and sharpening their skills before graduating can be help in this competitive society. Also, popular as the conceptâ€”â€”part-time job is, more and more students believe that the traditional kind of college lifeâ€”â€” sitting in classrooms studying all day is just out of date. They tend to go out, seeking a chance to get an cool job. After all, making money on their own sounds extremely exerciting. However, at the negtive concern, problem arises that different from some developed countries, (where students commonly take part-time jobs and from where the word part-time job came)the money part-time jobs can provide in China is so little that almost no one can actually live on it and keep setting aside an appropriate amount of time for learning as well. So money is not the key of its popularity. For many of us, a part-time job may only add 10% to our pocket money. Another hidden problem may be serious. As part-time jobs apell millions of college students, some people manage to use their passion and make traps to get them in. They often pretend to offer you an good job, talk you in and persuade you pay all kinds of procedure charge. My roommate was beguiled of 1000 yuan last term without hesitation! The part-time job market is far from safe for we college students. From where I stand, part-time job can provide some help for poor students and improve abilities in some degree, but is never necessary for everybody.",CHN
"In the present, many students have part time job. The part time jobs that they do are sellers in cloth shops, book store, cashiers, waiters in restaurant or employees. I think, it should to do because you can find money by yourself. It very proud for me. You can help your parents to save their expenditure and you can save money for yourself. The important thing which you get from part time job is experiences because you meet people, came from other place and other habit. The part time job can make you have more responsibility and reasonable. When you have those experiences, you can use them in your daily life and also to put it in your resume whenever you apply for a job. The part time job is the good one choice. It gives you many good things. Although, the part time jobs can have many good things but as a student your first priority is to study. You should do the part time job when you have a free time from studying, doing your homework or helping your parents job. If you can do this, I think the part time job is very good activity. You can manage your time and try to gain benefits from both study and part time job. I support the college students to practice themselves how to manage their life while being a students. Part time job may teach them something that they can apply in the future. However, study should be more important than part time job. Part time job should be optional for them.",THA
"I agree with topic b is smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because of the restaurant in the country should have a very clean air a restaurant. I think is not good if many people smoke in restaurants because in the restaurant have a lot of people. The restaurant in the country have a child, old person. A smoking not good for healthy with own smoker and other person too. A smoking have a pollution very much with environment. If The restaurants in the country should be complete banned the people are happy to eat in the restaurants and have fresh air because of don't have a pollution from smoking. And banning smoking complete at all restaurants is very safety for the customers are eat in restaurants and can make safety from smoker come in restaurant. All the restaurant in the country should have to label banned smoking in restaurants. And label in the restaurants should be interesting sign board because of make to customers understand to disadvantage from smoking and must not smoking at all restaurant in the country because of safety for healthy other people ant safety for smoker too. Banned completely smoking at all the restaurant is very good for most people whom come to eat and good for health everybody come in restaurant.",THA
"I think the answer is ""yes""! Because when I was a student, I always get ""part time"" to support my life cost. Because I thought I already became adult so I most do my best and don't let my parents worry! I often do servicer, because my strong skill is solve custom question and make they happy. The most job I like is in ""Fridays', because this is America system so if you know all about it, you also can go to work in America. And I also have a chance to talk with foreigh; I always have no opportunity to talk at the school and only increase listening and writing in the class. So I think the place cause me approve. By the way, accentlt I do the ""show girl"" in Taipei, this is a special experice that I only want do one time. inspite this job can earn much money but the worst is you must wear less and not scare when someone watch your body. By the way, I very like do ""pt"", because I always learn knowledge at the job and I even think it is very fun. As I study at junior high school until university, I do more than thirty jobs. And I think this is very helpful to my formal job.",TWN
"More and more college students have part-time jobs nowadays. Here comes a question whether it is important for us college students to have a part-time job. From my point of view, we students should take part-time jobs. Here are the reasons. Firstly, with the money we earn from the part-time jobs, we can be partly financially independent on parents. As we have become adults, we need to live an independent living step by step. Taking a part-time job gives us a chance to learn how to earn money by our own hands. Such subject helps us set the stage for a completely independent living in the future. Secondly, part-time jobs can improve our ability how to administrate our time. A part-time job isn't an easy work. Taking a part-time job will spend us a lot of time and energy. The main duty of students is to study. So, we must learn how to balance the both sides if we take a part-time job. We have to think of how much time we should spend on the jobs and how much on our study. Step by step, we can find the balance point and know how to administrate our time. Finally, we can have a chance to contact the society by taking part-time jobs. College is consisted of students. It isn't like the real society. By taking a part-time job, we can communicate with the people who have work many years and know more about the lives outside the colleges. So, we can learn more about the society. To sum up, part-time jobs help us get advanced and widen our horizon. Moreover, we can set the stage for our future life by taking part-time jobs.",CHN
"In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, college students can learn our society by working. For example, they learn the way to get money, to communicate with customers and to work with others well. In fact, I had a part-time job and learned so many things, by working. I think these things are useful after I graduate. Second, they pay a lot of money to their colleges and most of them is helped by their parents. But they spend a lot of money playing with their friends, buying things they want and traveling with their friends. This is very important so they should do so. But they should get money to play themselves. In fact, I get money for playing myself. I think it is natural and I should do so. Third, college students have a lot of time and energy. Their 150work is very valuable and give energy for society. I think It have many merits for college student to work and they should have a part-time job for their parents and themselves. In consequence, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",JPN
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, money is very important for our life. Everybody spends money to pay everything, no matter car, home, food, technology, medicine, education, etc. If you have no money, you don't have a comfortable in your life. Moreover, education is very important for everybody. Especially the modern people like me. If we have enough education, we will get the comfortable in our life. Although, I get an enough education, somebody doesn't have opportunity to study. They don't have opportunity to study, since they have no money to study. When I go to study in the university, I think I have to buy many things. These are example about things that I have to buy or pay; uniforms, textbook, computer, dormitory, the internet per month, cost of living in daily life, cost of register, etc. My parents have to pay for me about 80, 000 baht in the first month. However, I spend a lot of money; it's very important things in my life. My parents pay for me about 5, 000 bath per month, but I think it's enough for me. I never buy the brand name, since I think it's not important for me. I never eat food that so expensive. So, I think the part-time job isn't important for college students.",THA
" In my point of view, part-time job is a necessity for college students. It is estimated that 30% of the college students have done a part-time job. It will bring us quite a few benefits. First of all, earning money is the primary aim of most people. It can release the financial burden of our parents and even make our college life more comfortable. Secondly, the experience it gives us is quite valuable and precious. Once you have experienced the bitterness that few people have, you would have more understandings of life, study, and what we want to achieve. Surly we will be strong enough to face the challenges. We all know that one day we will inevitably step into society and find a suitable job for ourselves. But, how to cooperate with the colleagues? How to work better? How to get along well with the employer? There are many rules and principles that we can't get in class. And if we learn them now, we will have advantages. Of course, we had better look for a part-time job in spare time, but only on condition that we have managed our courses. The grade should be our top concern. In a word, there are a lot of benefits of doing a part-time job, and we are supposed to arrange learning and doing jobs correctly.",CHN
"Yes I agree with the above statement. The first and foremost reason is because smoking is totally harmful to one's health and well-being. When someone lights up a cigarette in the restaurant, the smoke that they puff out and either linger in the air or travel around the room is known as second-hand smoking. Second-hand smoking brings even much more disastrous effects and can be detrimental to one's health if they keep breathing the smoke in for a long period of time. Non-smokers who patronized the restaurants just want to have a good time dining and chatting with their companions so they should not have to deal with the smokers who suddenly feel the need to light up. Everyone has been taught to respect one another, the most basic thing when we were younger. So I suggest if the smokers would like to smoke one or two cigarettes, they could respect the other diners and step out of the restaurant for that few minutes and smoke outside or at designated corners of an open-air restaurant if there is one. It would also be a little disgusting if you were to find bits and pieces of cigarette smoke in your soup because a smoker from the table beside yours does not have the basic courtesy to step out for a little while for that puff.

"I have to say that in my opinion it depends completely upon the student in question. Some students are very busy and have very hard majors such as engineering, psychology, biology, and more. Some students have major is that all acquire such intensive work such as business, political science, philosophy, and art. Therefore, a student should determine for his self or for herself if a part-time job is an appropriate investment of their time. For some students, a part-time job may put too much stress on their already busy schedules, but for other students, a part-time job may help them fight boredom and also make some money at the same time. For me, a part-time job is an important part of my weekly schedule because I do volunteer work. Although I did not make any money, my part-time job counts as credit towards my courses, so I can get a taste of the real business world and get some experience and be doing schoolwork all at the same time. I think I was very lucky to find this part-time job, and if all other college students can find such a position that fits their situations very well, I think they should have a part-time job too.",ENS
"College while working, many positive things that can be obtained. Students usually worked as creative designers, part time teachers or part-time administrative staff. Generally, students working at the college in accordance with the science they are learning in the university. There are also students who choose jobs that are not associated at all with the science they are studying at university, usually in the form of part-time job, for example as a writer. Many positive things can be obtained by working, In addition we can have their own income, the experience we get when work is very useful to support the lecture itself. At least we can feel directly all matters relating to the real world of work, Which we only know from books and sharing of the faculty. With the knowledge and direct experience, we will be more easily understand the content of the lecture. Another advantage of working at the time of college, students can use the company they work as a case study object for the task, discussion or college papers. This is will give a lot of convenience to students, because they are familiar with both the company and the maintenance of a license to do research would be much easier too. Students can also use the facilities provided by the company, such as computers or even the internet service It's a little bit tiring college while working, but what are we going to get far beyond the struggle that we do. At the beginning it feels a bit heavy, but after some time we will be regular. But always remember, the college should remain a top priority.",IDN

"Due to certain pressures of college life, there have been circumstances that make college students think that it is important to have part time jobs. However, I think otherwise. There is no special need for a college student to have a part time job unless they have no other choice. A reason for this is because they can negotiate with others to gain certain privileges or achieve goals. For instance, if a student wants to be more independent or want to try to become more mature, the individual can always negotiate with his or her parents. He or she should negotiate regarding the limits of his or her freedom and the amount of allowance to be provided such that there is no need to be too dependent on the student's parents. If the need for a part time job arises due to the lack money, the student can always try to budget with he or she has and study and work hard to obtain a scholarship. The individual should only acquire a part time job if he or she is truly left with no other choice. After all, a part time job can put quite the toll on one's studies.",PHL
