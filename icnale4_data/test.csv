"Today, the increasing rate of people who smoke is greater every day, as well as the higher rate of people who is suffer from people who smoking. Thai government and other associations find the solution to reduce smoking. For example, Thai government released the new campaign to reduce the smoking area in Thailand by avoid people to smoke in the restaurants. From this, it shows that smoking is the biggest problem that influent to the health problem, environment, and personality of person who smokes. Firstly, smoking is not good because it damage our health. In cigarette, there are many toxic chemical that can damage your lungs. Moreover, from the researches, smoking is danger to the people who inhale it more than harm the people who smoke it. Many people have to suffer from lung and heart disease, and in some people, they have to open the windpipe and attach the pipe into it to help that people breathing. Secondly, smoking makes people lose their good personality. People who smoke will have black lips, and become thinner. Smoking will make people ill and unhealthy, and then they will look bad and lose their personality and look not good as a result. Finally, Smoking is not good because it causes the bad environment. Smoke of cigarette has awful smell and makes that area have bad smell too. The smoke has toxic chemical which cause the diseases in people, in addition, it is harmful for plants and other living things too. Many plants around the smoking area will not healthy and die. All in all. From this problem government should release more campaign and law to protect people who not smoking from people who smoking in public area or in restaurants to decrease people from being victim from the danger of smoking.",B1
"I think that part-time job is very important for college students. I have three reasons for that. The following passage is the reasons why I think that. First, it is because students are very poor. We have to spend a lot of money in various situations. For example, we have to buy textbooks, have lunch, and have dinner with my friends. If I live alone because my parent's home is very far from my college, the money I have to pay by myself will be very high. Second, we have to reduce my parent's expenses. The total of our expenses for my going to college are over two million yen. Our parents pay them. So we have to earn money to help them, even if they are little money. Third, I think that it is very important to know difficulties with working while we are students. We have to graduate from college for four years and work in society for about forty years. If we have never had a work-time job while we are college students, we won't be able to keep up with the difficulties with working. For these reasons, I think it is very important for college students to work part-time.",B1
"I can't agree with that statement at all. Many college students that I know and also myself when I was a student, worked out of necessity. Aside from compulsory internships during summer vacation periods, the rest of the working time was only important because we needed the dollars. In my case, I was paying part of my way through college and was also attempting to get my student loans decreased rather than face a huge debt as soon as I graduated. If the statement was referring specifically to working out of necessity which it is not, then I could agree. The most important thing in college is doing well because it's a cutthroat world out here in the real world and we need every edge we can get. A part-time job is only important if financial circumstances dictate that it is a necessity or it is linked to some form of internship that will assist with future job prospects. Unfortunately, due to the current economic climate, part-time jobs are becoming more and more of a necessity otherwise we will see fewer and fewer new college enrolments and graduations. Many students, prospective and current are feeling the economic pressure that has been brought about by the near global financial collapse.",C2
"I think when you are college students, You should concentrate for study. If you have a part-time job while you study, you do it not extremely. You shouldn't do two things in the same time. If you have part-time job, you could have enough time for reading or free time for relaxation. Although you have much money but you haven't life while study. You could have not time for your friend and family. You won't do something, you want to do. You could try for studying and part-time job. Do you think ? if you have much money but you don't have friend. Are you happy? But if you think more. When you have part-time job, you have experience more many people. There are advantages and disadvantages, we should be very selective and careful to choose. Part time give you experience and money but you may lose friends in the university and you may fail the study because you don't have time to revise the book and do the homework. Studying only, you may study very well, concentrate to the study, classroom. You have interactions with your teachers and your friends in the university, you may have good friends, close friends but you don't have experience for working. But for me, studying only is better in this time.",A2
" The facts about smoking are out there, public knowledge, clear for all to see. Smoking causes lung cancer, destroys the health of new-borns (when the pregnant mother smokes), reduces stamina, stains teeth, and the list goes on. It's not just the smokers who suffer these ill effects; anyone who is subjected to the inhalation of the smoke also has the potential to suffer these same effects in a similar capacity. The problem with smoking is that it cannot be effective contained within any particular area. The smoke flows like the wind; it is not sucked away by fume hoods over stoves. Why do governments persist with allowing smoking in the first place given that there are no health benefits? Is the money brought in by the tobacco companies worth more than the health of its citizens? That is looking more the case with every smoking related death. All restaurants should ban smoking within their premises. In a world that is trying to push for healthy living from eating right, then perhaps the next logical step is to promote healthy breathing too. The absence of smokers in these eating places will bring economic benefits as well. Many non-smokers and those who cannot stand the fumes from smokers will then be able to enjoy the food offered at these restaurants. If a restaurant wants to allow smoking in its premises, then it should be a smokers-only venue. This economically unviable option would cause all businesses to follow suit and ban smoking indefinitely. Just like no one should be subjected to unwilling sexual assault, no one should be subjected to unwilling lung assault by these toxic fumes too. ",B2
"Part time job is a kind of job which enable the workers to work half time than full job. For the college student, part time job is solution to get money without leave their study. beside that, part time is very useful some college student to earn money in easy way. But, all of that can be a good way if the college student can manage the time. if they can't, it will be a serious problem. The student who have a part time job and can't manage the time usually broke their result in test even that happen. They still work and study in the same time, because of that many worker student done their study without a good grade. The resolution of this problem is, the college student can get a part time job when they done 2 years in study (usually call as senior student). why 2 years? Because student have done 2 years in study is a student who have a skill to manage the time. Beside it, the senior college student's mental is harder than new student and even they got bad result. They can fixed it without disturb they work. Part time job for the senior student is also help them to prepare themselves to get a real job and prepare them to be a quality worker.",B1
"Smoking is very hazard for your health. People who smoke a lot will be sick. Smoking will be the cause of lung cancer and other diseases. The worst thing is people who smoking will receive only 30% of the smoke. But people who don't smoking but breathe the smoke in their lungs will receive 70% of the smoke. That mean people who don't smoking but stand next to the smoker have more risk to have lung-cancer and other diseases about respiration system more than the smoker. Now, we know about the danger of smoke so we have to do something to protect ourselves and our health from the smoke. One thing that everyone can do is to ban the smoker who smoking in public place. Especially in the place that wind can't blow through for example the pub, the restaurant, the gym etc. Because these places have a lot of people that don't want to receive the smoke. If the smokers want to smoking, it should be somewhere that far from many people or public places. Or the smoker should see the doctor to cure and stop smoking. If these ways can't stop smoking, the government should draw the law about smoking.",B1
"In my own opinion, I rather disagree because of having part time job while being as college students is distracting. The students may have not enough to read the book and review the lessons. Since we have a lot of university activities such as sport game, welcome party, and many stuffs the classroom such as homework, projects, reports, presentations etc., we have to focus on study and university' life not working. However, I may state in a very strong negative opinion about having a part time job when being a college students, I don't mean that I won't support this idea. Actually, to have a part time job is possible to be done if the students do after their classes or they have plenty of time and they can handle their study. Everything contains pros and cons. The students have to take a risk by themselves. They might take some advantages while doing a part time job but some may lose their study. Anyhow, it makes me think that working Part Time is not necessary for students; they rather keep focusing on studying on a daily basis. The students have to rate which one should come first, which one is the most important for their lives now.",B1
"I agree with this opinion. I have three ideas. First, college students have to lern how hard to earn money is. In order to make money, you have to smile even when you don't feel good, you have to obey your manager even if you don't like him or her. It is not so easy to earn money, but by knowing it, you can lern how important money is. If you guraduate from college without knowing it, you may spend hard time when you get job. Second, you can be known with a lot of people. By having a part-time job, you can communicate with a lot of people. Some people go to other colleges and other people don't go to college and have been working for a long time. You can lern so many things from these peple. Finally, by doing part-time job, you can enjoy college life more. You can't date with your boy friend or girl frend, you can't hang out with your friends on weekend if you don't have money. If you work at part-time job harder, your can get money and you can enjoy dineer with your lover or drinking with your friends. Ofcourse, it is very important to study when you go to college, but these things are also important for college students. It's because you will be busy in working and you won't have enogh time to do these things after graduation. So, to make your college life better, you should do part-time job and make money.",B1
"Smoking in restaurants should be strictly prohibited because other customers might lose their apetites and leave and they could also complain about that situation of them inhaling the stinky cigarette smoke, i have read before that second hand smoking, the ones who directly inhale the cigarette smoke; is much more dangerous that smoking itself because second smokers directly inhale the chemical filled smoke from cigarettes and has bigger chances of the second hand smoker to be prone to diseases. In some restaurants smoking inside is allow and the other non-smokers tend to complain about the smell of the cigarettes smoke and this causes the restaurants to lose some customers because of the smoker complaints. In some restaurants smoking is banned because the place is aircondition and the fire alarms might turn on but in other open restaurants and fastfood chain there are specific spots for smokers to smoke while they eat. In some restaurants (restobar) they let smokers smoke anywhere they want because they also sell cigarettes so it would increase their income and they even provide ash trays. Today some restaurants does not allow smoking inside the vicinity. I therefore conclude that new restaurant managements strictly prohibit and discourage smoking.",B1
"After graduating from high school and had hamburgers and pizza at the store part-time job. Most of the women responsible for the counter in the kitchen, but I was responsible for a burger. In the kitchen and everyone except me was the man. More responsible in charge of kitchen counter and helped me, but a lot of men. Working one month and earned 640, 000 won. But the money disappeared in less than one week. I'm making money as a gift to my parents and my grandfather gave to the allowance of 50, 000 won. Although little money, really pleased with my grandfather looked at me proud. For the rest of the money spent to buy my clothes. I will bring this summer, but is also part-time. I really like a cafe called peulyirago. I want to work there. Nice and bright personality, because I can do well might wonder. And I bet the boss is because it is precise and calculated. Again, the money earned will be gifts to the family. My dad is a part-time job, but I do not like haneungeot. I hope to concentrate on my studies. But I do not think so. I've learned many things, even if the first byte. Part-time in my life would be very helpful, I think.",B1
"Have you ever done a part-time job? What do you think about it? Of cause when you are in college you thinking about having more money to buy what you like. If you have a lot of free time and you don't know what to do. I should say that why not you try part-time job. Part-time job can give you many profits. The most important is the part-time job can give you money and help your family save money. If you can find money by yourself you don't need to tell your family to give you money that is the way how your family can save money. You should do part-time job if you have free time. It is better than you just sit still at home and didn't do anything. Past-time job can give you a lot of experiences that you can use after you graduated and working. For example, if you doing a part-time job in supermarket you will know how to selling a thing and you will know a lot about marketing. Now a day, In Europe America Japan, most of teenagers do part-time job because they want to get money and experience. Are you the one who let your free time past and gone or you are the one who use it benefitly?",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Recently the entire world starts to find the problem of smoking. Smoking has a lot of disadvantage, such as, making your lungs worst and worst, your mouth smell bad and the worst of all is when you are smoking you will hurt yourself and people around you at the same time! In addition, once you get into the habit of smoking, you will spend a lot of time to quit this habit and finally you may feel it too difficult so give up quickly! To stop smoking continue being a threat to people, completely banned it at all the restaurants in the country is necessary. As everybody know smoking has threat our health many years, and we should improve this problem as soon as possible! Many reports have proved that people who get lungs cancer more than a half is that they have a family get into the habit of smoking. It means that many people are cursed by people smoking around them. So, in order to improve this problem, I think the first step is to use the law to ban these people smoking in the public place. Although this way can't help people quit smoking, it can help many people who hate the smell and protect our health at least.",B1
"I agree with smoking should not allow in restaurant. Smoking destroy smoker and people everyone around. If someone smoke, the health will have many bad sides such as a disease, cancer in lungs and still destroy person health who live in same location. I see many people around smoke in public area and in restaurant. They smoke in university too. It no good to smoke. If punishment for smokers, it is good. Smoking still consume expenses unreasonably to make people easy to die. They have a little time to stay. A person who smoke cigarettes is not good personality in other eyes, a person around stare at and think they are not good. They are not good to follow. But many kid like to follow them because kid think it is cool but it is bad idea. So who to smoke cigarettes then should quit to smoke. It is the good idea for them and for person around them. I agree smoking should not allow in everywhere. It is bad smell and no benefit to smoke. But if the restaurant want people to smoke, the restaurant must make a corner for smoker. Tell them to smoke in the corner and away from, anyone don't smoke. It is okay to do.",A2
"Part time jobs produce extra pay to those who think that their current jobs don't pay well. Numerous people of our country, do freelance. For countless reasons, people choose for a part time job because they need extra money. Others go for part time jobs since that they want their free time or extra time to be resourceful. In our case as college students, we, having different schedules of classes and times of leisure, sometimes get the longing for job involvement, extra earnings, financial and educational support, that is why we prefer a part time job. Parents of some students don't have that much income so others tend to apply for scholarship or go for part time jobs at night. But in some cases, some students won't prefer part time jobs. Some do not have extra time that's why they won't go for part time jobs. They just seem to stay put in where they are. Even if they wanted to, it will be hard for them to cope up. Several people who worked part-time through their studies, found it hard balancing between reorganizing their education, their work and social life Another concern with part time jobs in students was stress since it began to utterly affect their health and their way of thinking and manner in handling ordeals. Students who have part time jobs can pay their own payments or personal spending without demanding support from their parents. Having a part time job as a student is a good choice because it trains students to be financially independent and also can give extra money for those who do not have that much money to pay tuition fees.",B1
"Part time jobs can help you financially especially when you're in college. College tuition fees vary on your course and of course, the school you are going to study at. If the university you are going to study at is well-known and has good standards, the more it is expensive. Though there are universities that offer scholarships, there are just chosen students who can commit to it. Some public schools offer less tuition fees but you still pay them. Having a part-time job can help you especially when you applied to a job that has great amount of salary but as a student, I doubt you're going to find a job that offers a lot of money. Studying while working can cause you difficulties on your time and schedule. It is either you're going to sacrifice time for your studies or your job. Working isn't really needed in college when you still have your parents to support you. It doesn't mean that you'll let them pay until you have children. You'll just have to pay them back by doing little things for them like washing the dishes and stuff, especially when your grades are high. Your parents will really appreciate it. They won't regret giving you the money to study in a prestigious university. So for me, part-time job isn't really needed unless you're family needs money and you have to sacrifice a little bit of time for working in place of studying. You must be determined to do both at the same time.",B1
"I agree the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Certainly, some people disagree this idea and think college students should spend the time instead the time of a part-time job. But, I have three reasons of agreement. First, I think a part-time job makes my independence. I notice the independence of money by earning by myself. So I thank my parents since I started a part-time job. Second, I made friends for a part-time job. There are fifteen college students and four students of all students are students of *** University. All people get along with well. My teacher said me, Why don't you do a part-time job of teaching? Teaching is high salary. Indeed, my salary of part-time job is 900 yen an hour. But I'm satisfied with my salary because I can make friends of various university. Finally, I noticed the real independence of word 'Arigatou!!'. My part-time job is waiting on customers. Before I started my part-time-job, I thought I can't speak my customers well. But I could speak my customers now. And I could notice the independence of 'Arigatou!!'. If my customers don't say anything when I bring dishes to my customers, I feel dislike and uneasiness. If they say me 'Arigatou!!', I'm very very happy!! So I want to service the customer well more and more!! This experience makes me say 'Arigatougozaimasu!' in other stores. Therefore I agree this idea very much!",A2
"Yes I agree that smoking should entirely be banned all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is bad and it can harm the body of the smoker and the people surrounding them. If smoking isn't ban in restaurant, some families might not want to go to that restaurant to eat as they do not want to harm their body by inhaling that harmful and polluted air. There are more non-smokers than smokers therefore there may be a result in loss of customers and therefore it will result In loss of business as not many people will go there to eat. By banning smoking in the restaurants, there will be a reduction in cases of people having heart, lungs diseases due to smoking. With that, smokers will have lesser chances to smoke due to lack of smoking areas and slowly they will quit smoking which is a good thing for themselves, their family and the other non-smokers as well as the environment. This also can be a good influence to the younger generations as it can plays a major role in dissuading younger generations such as teens and younger adults from taking up smoking. In conclusion, smoking is bad for everyone thus smoking should banned all restaurants in the country. ",B1
"Global warming is now an alarming issue not only faced by the Philippines, but by the whole world. Smoking is one of the many contributions to the increasing effects of global warming. An effort the Philippines can make in order to slow down the irreversible effects of global warming is by banning smoking. The Philippine government should not put a total ban on smoking at once; however, it should start somewhere, and someplace. One of these places could be restaurants, very public places where people coming from all walks of life gather for numerous reasons. Starbucks, a coffee franchise that has found a developing popularity in the Philippines, has now banned smoking as part of its efforts to save the environment. Ethically speaking, I believe that smoking in restaurants and other public places should be banned in the Philippines because not everyone smokes. Some people, such as myself, think that it is rude to smoke near someone who is aware of the health risks brought by smoking and second-hand smoke. I have experienced eating at a restaurant where I was seated beside a smoker. I found myself losing my appetite as the smoker exhaled his foul smelling smoke in my face. Moreover, smoking does not have any proven positive effects on a smoker aside from the relaxation it brings; however, relaxation could be achieved through other activities that do not harm the environment and other people.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. It is really nice and good rule. Smoking has many lose for human life. Not for active smoker but so for passive smoker. It can damage their self and other man too. Smoking can disturb our healthy, body, and comfortable of around us. The fumes of cigarette can broke the lung and respiration system in body. If there many man use the cigarette in general place, it has contribute the bad things about the air pollution and dirty situation. Such as in the restaurant, it's should be clean place and free from the smoking because that place is used for the people to enjoy the comfortable eat. Restaurants is a place to had by many people to rest and refresh the body with fill up the stomach with some food to get much power for do their activity, so there are not too good if they eat with around the smoker who can decrease the quality of their food. They want to go to the restaurant to enjoy the food. So, it is a good rule that smoking should be banned in the restaurant to give the good service to the costumer.",B1
"In my opinion. I think the students will work part time to earn extra after school is not very important. If students do not have a financial problems. They should be study hard. When they have free time, they should read books or do other activity such as sport, music etc. But if a part-time job does not interfere with the time to read books or do other activity and students need to lighten the burden of home. It is better to work part-time job. We should see that their own ability. We have enough ability to learn, coupled with a part-time job without any study or not. Because at least. A part-time job is a practical experience of working with others as well. In case of students have a financial problems in the family. A part-time job is quite important because it will lighten the burden of home and earn income families to rely on themselves. So that parents do not have to worry about our expenditures. Moreover, there is also a self-trained to work experience, responsible for your work, trained themselves on time and working with others as well too. Therefore, a part-time job is important or not. It depends on several factors as well.",B2
"Nowadays, there are a lot of people smoke for several reasons. Someone smoking to relax or peer pressure. Nevertheless, someone wants to abstain from smoking but they can't because of addiction. I have been in a restaurant eating my food, then a cloud of smoke coming to me and I felt very bad. So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my view, three major reason that should be banned at the restaurants in the country. First, a cloud of smoke annoys the customers in restaurant. It effects on other customers who smell it. Healthy problem is second reason. Smoker may illness such as lung disease, heart attack, and etc. Third, if you do not smoke you can save your money. In the restaurant, some people want to smoke and enjoy their meal. I would think that they can smoke at the place where set up for them. Possible, you should abstain from smoking because it good for you In conclusion, I would think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it annoys other customers, it effects on the health's smoker, and it wastes the money uselessly.",B1
" Smoking is on the increase in Pakistan. Young girls and boys of colleges and universities fall an easy victim to it. Smoking is not a new thing, it has been in practice for centuries. A person who is a victim of smoking can not avoid it. His habits of smoking increase day by day and he smoking even on those places which are not appropriate for it, smoking in restaurants is one example of it, same people start smoking in restaurants which is a place for eating and drinking. Smoke of the cigarette pollute the atmosphere of restaurant. Smoking also disturb the other peoples sitting in the restaurant and their meal lost its taste. The use of cigarette harms the physical and moral facilities. It effects our lungs, hearts, kidneys. It causes T. B and cancer. It relieves our depression for a short time and gives us temporary pleasure. Smoking should be banned in restaurants to clean the environment. It should also banned to maintain public rules. One reason to Bann smoking is that it disturbs other people who dislike this activity. If government banns smoking in restaurant then our society shows good manners and ethics, and it would be the sign of civilized society. Smoking must be banned in restaurants to protect oue eating hall from pollution. Smoking should be banned because it creates bad impression among innocent children's.",B1
"I agree with the idea that many college students should have a part-time job, but I think it is up to the students to decide for themselves if they will have enough time to fit this into their schedule so that they can still balance their class work and socialize in order to have the best college experience possible. Many students are too busy to have a part-time job, and such a student would be well advised not to place extra stress on themselves by finding a part-time job. On the other hand, a student who has enough time to have a part-time job may enjoy the extra benefits having part-time work can bring such as developing professional contacts and expanding your network of future colleagues. Next, it would be interesting to see if there have been any studies upon how many hours they student can work before they begin to negatively affect their performance in school. I guess that somewhere around 20 hours which is the upper limit for part-time work, students would begin to feel like they have no choice but to not do some of their schoolwork so that they can complete all of their work tasks. As long as they can say under this upper limit, they can probably balance everything they need to balance, and they will be better off for learning how to do that.",C2
"In many survey, many people agree smoking banned at all the restaurants. But should smoking be completely banned at all in the restaurants in the country? I think the answer is completely yes. As we know, some elements which contained in cigarette may damage people's body. Doctors warn that many smokers have terrible diseases like cancer and heart problems later. Hence, smoking is unhealthy habit. It should be banned in restaurants. On the one hand, it is unhealthy; on the other hand, smoking in restaurant is impolite especially western country. Also, passive smoking is more dangerous than smoking according to many doctors and health experts. In order to your health and your family's health, please not smoking in the restaurants when eating!However, people who have smoking in long time ago think it is too cruel with them if they cannot smoke in the restaurants. Maybe raise something bad. In fact, no smoking in restaurant proves smoker's quality. It means they care about others. On summary, smoking in restaurant should be banned and we need this policy. For your health and other people's health, stop smoking in public. Smoking in everywhere will make our society around pollution air isn't it? No smoking in restaurant protects our society and all the people's health.",B1
"Nowadays, every restaurant has smoking seats and nonsmoking seats in Japan. However, even when we sit on a nonsmoking seat, there is often the smell of tobacco from smoking seats. The smell makes people who dislike tobacco feel bad and they lost appetites. It seems that the freedom of smoking of a smoker should be accepted to some extent. However, restaurants are not where people enjoy smoking, but where people enjoy eating delicious dishes. Restaurants should be kept as the place where all people can enjoy dishes. Therefore smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Smoking doesn't only make people feel bad with its smell, but also has a bad influence on others' health. They say that the smoke that a nonsmoker near a smoker absorbs has more harmful substances than that the smoker absorbs. Passive smoking is very bad for our body. Therefore, when you think about smoking, you will notice that where smoking is banned is increasing in Japan. For instance, we cannot smoke in trains, movie theaters or class rooms in the university. Therefore it is natural that smoking is banned at restaurants. Smoking is worse than useless. In Japan, these days, it is also difficult to buy tobacco because the price is becoming higher and higher, and the system of Taspo has been enforced. I hope that the number of smokers decrease with such reasons. When restaurants become the place where smoking is banned, it will help decreasing the number further more.",A2
"Part time jobs can be very tiring but have you ever thought that some persons really need to have one so that they can live and eat while schooling? Have you ever thought that some people really need jobs to pay their bills and debts from the hospital and neighbors? The sad reality is that they're all true. Some students are being punished and suffer because they don't get enough pay for the family and the father comes home drunk and beats up the wife and children. The typical setting in the squatters area with children with good grades striving to be the best. Part time jobs are okay if you're good in time management, balancing work and studies and take time for everything. Like the famous saying, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step from the quote by Chinese philosopher Laozi. Having a part time job is big responsibility because you have more work and if you really like studying, then it is probably okay for you to work part time in the midst of crisis if you really want to get a degree or feed your family and in so many other cases. Part time jobs can be the start of your college to get a degree and achieve your dreams. Who knows, you might be the next president one day. Part time jobs while studying are a big responsibility, but then, if you really want something badly, then you will work for it and you will do everything to chase your dream.",B1
"No doubt, smoking is harmful to the human beings. But there are millions people in Taiwan smoke or ever do it. However, I believe that there are much more people do not like the smell of smoking. So banned smoking at all restaurants is necessary. The rule can protect people who don't smoke away from the harm of smoking. But there are lots of smokers still smoked in restaurants or public area in fact. They show no respect to other people. So how to make them follow the rule is another important topic to discuss. There are two useful ways could make smokers notice that smoking at restaurants or public area could get a punishment and think about whether doing it or not. One is to increase the payment of punishment, and once they broke the rule, the high fee might let them learn a lesson of smoking at restaurants or public area. The other way is to enforce the checking action at restaurants or public area, once someone was found smoking, he or she could get a punishment immediately and even his or her name would be on the black list. In modern society, respecting is a common manner. But in Taiwan, some people still smoke in their working place, restaurant and so on. So I think that there is much more space to increase for Taiwanese.",B1
"As you might have guessed from my other response, my mother is very protective of me, so smoking has always been a taboo subject in my household. One time I even just had a stupid Marlboro hat, and she was mad at me for a long time simply for having something that was related to cigarettes. I think that there are just as many Japanese moms out there who are very protective like my own, and they hate to see the fact that smoking is allowed in restaurants because they know how bad it is for their children. Also, they do not want their children to get involved in an activity that might lead to worse things such as drinking and gambling or even hard drugs. Although I do not appreciate my mother is strict control of me, I realize that she has my best interests in mind, and if the Japanese mothers have the best interests of their children in mind as well, they should seek to make this a more discussed issue so that they can ban smoking in the restaurants very soon. I hope that if I am never lucky enough to go to Japan that I did not have to worry about whether are not the restaurants are smoky.",C2
"Recently, the problem that whether smoking should be banned at restaurant is hotly discussed. I think the view point that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country has it reasons. On the one hand, smoking is a conventional manner on occasions like a meeting between friends. What's more, offering a smoke to a person is a generally accepted way of making acquaintance of him or her. In a word, it is smoking that often creates a relaxing atmosphere. On the other hand, it is also smoking that keeps many people and people who live with them from living a happy life. Many people have terrible diseases because of smoking for a long time. Also, the restaurant is a public place; these who smoke are to blame for spoiling others' health because second-hand smoke can be very harmful. People who are non-smokers will not have mood to eat when they sit close to smokers in the restaurants. On conclusion, I think smoking as a manner of long history, is impossible to be banned by law. The government and the press are supposed to try their best to spread knowledge about the harms of smoking. Thus, I agree with the banning of smoking at restaurants in the country. But not only by regulation, must we try to arouse people's awareness of the harms of smoking.",B1
" Part time job is becoming more and more popular. Many college students take part time jobs to get money to pay for the university or get some work experience. I think, part job is necessary for university students. First, part time job, in my opinion, is not just a way for money, it is a way to get work experience and learn about the society. Today, employees want not just your high grades, but also your work experience. Suppose that there are two persons wanting a job, one has a two-year part time job experience and the other has never worked for others before, the employee is sure to hire the former. So, part time job will help you find a better full time job. Second, part time job is also a way to get money. In the past, it is our parents who pay for us, but now we have grown up. It is responsible for us to make money ourselves to help our parents. I think parents will be happy to see that we can make a live by ourselves. Third, taking a part time job can help us make some friends of all kinds. Today, friends can help you a lot. They can give you good advice or they can help you when you get trouble. Part time job will let you know a lot of workmates, and they maybe your friends. From all above, we can see that a part time job is really necessary for college students. Some of my classmates have already taken part time jobs. So, find a part time job for yourself, it will help you a lot!",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Personally, I have a great dislike for the smell of smoke. However, even if we look at this issue objectively, it has many reasons to why it should be completely banned. Firstly, the harm of taking in second-hand smoke by unwilling non-smoker is the main reason. Taking in second hand smoke harms the lung of people who are not willing and yet are suffering it. Besides the health issue, the environment that customers wish to enjoy while dining will be destroyed as well. No customer who is a non-smoker will like to bear the ""smoky"" environment. Furthermore, they are paying for it as a customer. Secondly, being a restaurant, it will be an enclosed area which smoking will result an environment that will be not enjoyable for customer. This is unlike coffee shop which is open area and a smoker's corner can be designated smoker. Even though some restaurants have open areas, I will like to discourage designating a smoker's corner because this method may not be very useful. This is because there is still a possibility that the smoke generated from smoking can enter the enclosed dinning area. ",B1
"I think that Part time job in life of the university is not good. But university student need money in university life so they work a part time job. In practice, their university tuition is very expensive and they need money in their university life it is difficult problem. I think about this problem so I think part time job is not good but we live in society that needs an experience. Those experiences in part time jobs will help us to develop us society experience. Therefore, we should actively participate in part time job. Sometimes thinking this problem, we seem to lose studying time. People speak university student should have to study. We know it. But university is still very expensive. We give parents a many tuition. We are adult now. We need to learn how to independent because you arrive at man's estate. Experience is important but we are adult so, we do not give damage our parents. Of course it is very hard. We will win the society. Part time job is important part to win our problems. Some time or other part time job helps us to adapt this society. Therefore, Part time job is very important for our university life. I think part time job will become a my good assistant",B1
" Taking up a part-time job is more than merely about earning money. It is also about being accountable for one's expenses and managing one's finances properly. Moreover, having a part-time job prepares them for their work life in the future. Therefore, in my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. One can assert that having a part-time job is not important for college students who come from a rich family. Their parents give their children an allowance that can last for some time. When this amount runs out, these college students could tactfully convince their parents to give them more money. As a result, these college students would naturally regard and rely on their parents as a stable financial source for their daily expenses. Hence, there seems to be real need of this group of college students to take up a part-time job. Nevertheless, excessive reliance on their parents for money could be a real call for concern as it is difficult for them to appreciate how one can and why one needs to manage one's finances properly. When a college student decides to take up a part-time job, one would find a job that can cover his monthly expenses. Furthermore, one would most likely consider saving an amount for emergency or future use. All these considerations that are taken into account when finding a part-time job are exactly the ingredients of managing finances in a sensible manner. Hence, these college students take charge their own finances and thus it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Clearly, besides the monetary aspects of a part-time job, college students could also take away precious life lessons while being accountable for their own finances. Hence, in my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. ",B1
"I agree this idea. Many restaurants already make non-smoking area. So I think it's easy because we only need one more step to ban smoking completely. I'll show you 3 reasons to support my opinions. First reason is health. As you know, smoking causes many diseases for example lung cancer. And it is said that if you smoke one cigarette, your life span will shorten in 50 seconds. I think dangerous risk is so openly said so smoking people must stop it and be careful of their health. Second reason is passive smoking. Even if you want not to smoke, you would breathe smoke because of the one smoker. This is dangerous not only adult but also children especially baby. They can't escape from smoke by themselves. So parents should avoid smoking. And passive smoking can't prevent by family only. We need all social people's cooperation. So, smoking should be banned at all social place, of course including restaurant. Third reason is smells. Have you ever been to KARAOKE? Don't you feel uncomfortable by smell of cigarette? I have experienced that situation many times. Cigarette is annoying product. The existence itself is troublesome. For those reasons, I think all restaurants should ban smoking completely.",B1
"I agree. The First, smoking can threaten the health. As a report, a cigarette contains more than, 000 different toxic or poisonous chemicals such as nicotine and carbon dioxide. This chemical ingredients threaten the health especially lung. Smoking leads not only smokers but also non- smokers to die. According to a survey, more than 50, 000 Americans die from secondly hand smoke (SHS) every year. Of those, , 000 American non-smokers die from lung cancer. Like this, not only smokers but also SHS could cause the lung cancer. Therefore the public smoking should be prohibited. Second, smoking can make the public space especially campus unpleasant environment. A poison gas and a harmful content of e cigarette can pollute the air of public space. The campus space must be a safe and pleasant environment for faculty, staff and students. Smoking in campus of the public space plays a role in causing unpleasant environment. As a survey at Utah State University about 80% of students would support a policy making the campus completely smoke-free. Most of the air pollutes the clean air of campus which is made of trees and then the students are not pleasant. Smoking in the public space especially campus should be prohibited.",B1
"Smoking is unhealthy activity which has bad effect to the person who smoke ( active smoker ) and the person who does not smoke but breath the smoke of smoking person ( passive smoker ). The bad effects of smoking to passive smoker are more dangerous than to the active smoker. Because statement is scientifically proven. Moreover smoking in the restaurant is not suitable with the place it self. Restaurant is the place for the people who buy and eat food. So if there is smoking person while we are eating automatically the smoke will disturb us. The smoke also pollutes the environment. In biology we know that the smoke that goes out of the smoker's mouth and so if passive smoker will get the more dangerous effect because the active smoker just breath and few of the smoke. So smoking is dangerous for the smokers and other people in the restaurant who do not smoke. Not only that, although there is smoking room in the restaurant and hopefully all customers who are smokers will smoke in that room. But in reality smoking room is useless because the smokers who want to buy food in the restaurant, they not obey to the rule with smoking inside of restaurant.",A2
"I can't agree to the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Whether it is reasonable to smoke in the restaurants depends on the real case though smoking is proved to be bad for people's health. And in most of cases smoking in the restaurants is not reasonable. For example, if smoke in elegance restaurants, it may influence people nearby taste their food and harm both sides' health. And it also may leave a bad impression to others and make others angry with you, which may lead a conflict. Smoking in public restaurants is bad for people's health so it should be signed that ""Please stop smoking for you and others"" in the wall of the restaurants. But in some cases if smoking is banned, the restaurants will not be able to operate well. For example, if the customers book a personal room to have a dinner, their behaviors of smoking will not affect others. Though it is bad for their health, it is their choices and they smoke for more enjoyment. The customers will be angry and get away and won't come any more if the restaurant manage doesn't allow them to smoke, which will drop the restaurant's business trades. And in the small restaurant in the countryside, smoking may be not easy to banned because the customer are almost farmers, which don't care much enough the rules. So let them go will make the restaurants operate along. So completely stop people from smoking in all the restaurants in the country is so absolute that it is impossible to reach.",A2
"As a college student, I have a part-time job of teaching kid. Part-time job is one of the biggest parts of my college life. Like I do, most of college students are working for part-time job and it become important part of college life. Students can get some benefits from part-time job. First, student can experience different form of society through part-time job. Before they experience part-time job, they only experienced society of school, family and friends which is very limited form of real society. If they have chance to expand their experience of many kinds of different society of relationship, such as boss and clerk in workplace and clerk and customer in the market, they can easily adapted to society when they graduate the college. Part-time job is one of the good chances to learn. Second, student can earn money from part-time job. As a college student, they have to make money for both school and pocket money themselves. They can learn how difficult to earn money and how important to spend money properly. If they never learn these before get the job, they will suffer from mistakes of misusage of money. Earning money from part-time job and use money will be good opportunity to learn economical sense. Some people can say that part-time job is wasting of time and it will make student cannot concentrate to school work. However, benefit which student can get from part-time job is important as much as school work for future.",B2
"Have you ever get to part time after teenagers? Most teenagers want to make money without supporting their parents. In my case I could lots of advantages when I worked in a part time job. First of all, I could make different kinds of relationships. As you know, if I got a new circumstance, we could meet many people. Every people makes you learn valuable things whether you like each person or not. Second, I could have good skills from a part time job. If you work at restaurant kitchen, you could cook foods well. Also, if you work apparel store in department store, you could give people good services and could match clothe well depending on each situation or purpose. Finally, you can learn how valuable money is and how to deal with money well. If you take money from your parents, you just waste money easily. However, if you earn money for yourself to buy something, you couldn't use your money easily and think very carefully when you decide to use that. Through my experiences, if you have an opportunity to work in a part time job, you can learn economical advantage and social advantage in your life.",B1
"It is very important for college students to have a part time job. Now in many universities, there are some college students having a part job, such as sticking posters, to do private tutor, or to be the model. Students to have a part time job not only can make some money to change their life but also can gain experience. as a college students in the new century, who hasn't some societal experience, maybe will miss a good job, or miss a change of building a efficient network of relationship, which is the most important in the future. I have a part time job now. When some companies want to make a recruitment meeting, I and my classmates are working for them. For this, I can get a lot of money, and the most valuable, I have knew the recruitment process, so I can prepare from now on. If one overcome the sense of tense, I think his success rate will become high than who doesn't. And I have known several mentors they gave me great help. They help me pass through the confused in the university. I thank them a lot; we have built a hard friendship. So I think it is important for college students to have a part time job.",B1
"It is said that tobacco is a poison, harmful for our healthy, and it is caused of cancer and other severe disease. Many people die from smoking around the world each year. And recently, it is often said that secondhand smoke is more dangerous, especially for children. In the small room like restaurant, there is a lot of danger of secondhand smoke. Some restaurants in Japan, there are divided two types of seats, smoking seat and no smoking seat. But sometimes the two seats are closed. So if someone smokes in the restaurant, there is also a danger of secondhand smoke even if we seat no smoking seat. Therefore, to remove the danger of it, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And it may enable to decreases the number of smoker. Many countries, especially America and Europe, make many laws and regulations to restrain from smoking. And there are often banned from smoking at all the restaurants. But some Japanese people don't consider the danger seriously. They think that smoking is not so harmful for us. For that reason, Japanese laws and regulations about smoking are less and easier than that of other developed countries. But it should be more strictly in Japan. Smoking is harmful, not any good.",A2
"When you come to your college, you are surrounded with much information, one of which is about varies kinds of part-time jobs. Do you get one and do you want to get one? Here we are going to talk about part-time jobs. I think it's important to take part-time jobs. There are three simple reasons. Firstly, we have enough time to do a part-time job. I think we have similar class schemes with each other as college students. According to my subject scheme, we have at least three hours' spare time after classes. Then look at how our classmates spend their spare time. Some of them play computer games when they are free. And some of them just surf the internet for nothing but getting over their boring time. And so on. Don't you think it's a waste of life. Second, from this we can gain many skills that will be used when we step into social life. For example, you can learn how to deal with your workmates and have a simple understanding of work. What's more you can earn some money, although the wage is very low. You can also know hard is it to earn money, and begin to understand your parents more. After that you may be more careful about your money. So it's really important to have a part-time job.",B1
"I can't agree. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in the restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is an unfair event. Although smoking is not an illegal behavior, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in the restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer from financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment I discovered someone smoking. So, I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But, the staff said that the smokers had the rights of smoking there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry then. Luckily there have been laws to restrain the smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should be set up even earlier.",A2
"I think that college students should have a part-time job once. We are going to have a good experience for their future by having a part-time job. Part-time job is a good experience for to become a member of society. We can experience social responsibility and strict in advance by having a part-time job. These experience is good effects our future. And, because school days, we can have a many experience. If there are interesting, we should do it. Even if there are not interesting, we should have a part-time job to find sense. But, we become students to study. We should study. If we take all the time in school days to part-time job, we could not study enough and it is bad effects for our future. It is wrong that you have a part-time job without study and only study without have enough experience. We should have a part-time job and we also should study. So we should use time efficiently to study and have a good experience. Using time efficiently is also necessary to become a member of society. So I think that college students should have a part-time job.",A2
"Tobacco related diseases are some of the biggest killers in the world today. Smoking one cigarette a day results in a risk of heart disease that is halfway between that of a smoker and a non smoker. Among the diseases that can be caused by smoking are mouth cancer, lung cancer, heart attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many governments are trying to deter people from smoking with anti smoking campaigns in mass media stressing the harmful long-term effects of smoking. Passive smoking, or secondhand smoking, which affects people in the immediate vicinity of smokers, is a major reason for the enforcement of smoking bans. This is a law enforced to stop individuals smoking in indoor public places, such as bars, pubs and restaurants. The idea behind this is to discourage smoking by making it more inconvenient, and to stop harmful smoke being present in enclosed public spaces. Critics of bans in the restaurant suggest ventilation is a means of reducing the harmful effects of passive smoking. Many restaurant organizations claim that ventilation systems can bring venues into compliance with smoke free restaurant ordinances. Additionally, restaurant smoking bans may help stop young people from becoming habitual smokers and I therefore fully support this idea.",B1
"Restaurants are public places and pollution free. atmosphere within the restaurant will need to be eaten fresh. In each meal, food is useful to the human body. Therefore, restaurants will be an atmosphere of purity and pollution free. Smoking in restaurants and destroying the atmosphere polluting the restaurant. Will receive guests in the restaurant from cigarette toxins in to the body. To eat each meal, or in public places. We want to be clear, fresh and good atmosphere free from dust, pollution and smoking. Manners in a restaurant environment destroying themselves and others. And also interfere with other people. Enables consumers to store food poisoning in tobacco smoke into the body. Causing the aircraft to beam other customers and consumers lose the atmosphere of eating food. Smoking should be smoking in a smoking but not smoking where smoking is prohibited. In cigarette smoke contains nicotine which is toxins to the body. When smokers go very will accumulate toxins in the body and will harm the body as a substance causing lung cancer and other intestinal finally died in the end. So I do not agree with smoking in restaurants. It will not only harm themselves but also harm other around the beam and lost body build in a restaurant with atmosphere.",A2
"Nowadays more and more college students go out to have a part-time job in the society. I think it is a good sign. First, we can take some money from a part-time job, which can reduce the family burden. It is uneasy for our parents to raise us and now it's time for us to do something to let our parents relaxed. Second, it is a good chance to get to know society. We can learn something that we can't learn in college. It will be helpful for our future work. At the same time, we can find out which job we are interested in and are really good at. Last, we can meet more people. Some of them may become our good friends. In the last summer holiday, I became a private teacher. I taught math and English to a student in high school. I learn how to communicate with her better and learn some English that I didn't study well when I was in high school. After the teaching, my student becomes my good friend. she is younger than me and her thought is different with me and my former friends. I learn many thing from my student. Because of the teaching, I felt very substantial in the holiday. Through this experience, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"It is said that smoking is harmful. On the other hand, there is an opinion that smoking is harmless, too. I cannot judge whether smoking is harmful. However, I want to assume that smoking is harmful and to express my opinion. I think that smoking should not completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because the no smoking seat and the smoking seat have already been divided, I think that it need not limit more than now. There may be a person who regards passive smoking as a problem, too, but I think it won't be a problem at all if a designer cares about to air conditioning. I think that the modern society becomes strict with a smoker. I think that the reason is that feelings that the Japanese wants to belong to the majority are strong. I think that they want to think that does a good action by blaming the minority. I do not trust mass communication and the government, and I think that it is necessary for people to think whether all matters are always true. The sale of the cigarette should be prohibited if smoking should be really prohibited. However, the reality is not so. A tax enters by a smoker. Therefore I think that the government does not prohibit a cigarette. I think that it is important to watch from various angles. Therefore I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan in view of economical aspect and psychological aspect.",A2
"I know many friends who smoke frequently in their daily life. So if it is asked that whether smoking should be banned in all restaurants, I will not disagree with that. Smokers should have their rights to smoke in most of the places, and at least restaurant is one of those places. If someone argues that smoking will harm the health of the other people who are in the same restaurant, I think the set up of smoking and non-smoking areas can already solve the problem. Even though it may be difficult for some of the restaurants like fast food shop to set up the smoking area, smoking should not be banned in all the other restaurants. I know that the policy is aimed to taking care of the smokers by decreasing the time of smoking; this may not be practically useful since the smokers will smoke in the other places in the restaurant like toilet or just outside the restaurants. In this way, the situations remain the same and the other people are affected. Air pollution may be made more serious as well.",B1
"I agree with this. Because smoking is really bad for health, it's my main reason. I heard that it's poisonous to smoke somebody's smoke. I mean if someone smoke in front of non-smoker, the non-smoker could be affected sometimes more than smokers. Some restaurants separate the seat for non-smoker, but the smoke could reach to non-smoker. In the restaurant, we should enjoy the dishes without smoke. In many countries, smoking in the restaurant is not arrowed. Japan is too unconscious about smoking problem. There's no good point to smoking. We have to think about this more seriously. Me, I don't smoke and I really hate smoking. But actually I have many friends who smoke. I can't say them to stop smoking though I worried about their health, as I also know how hard to stop it and they want to stop if they can. One of my friends who often smoke said that she doesn't know how to stop smoking so she wants something changeable stuff without poisonous. I don't think smoking should be banned completely everywhere so far because it would be so hard for smokers, but I hope something changeable stuff will be made as she said. What I want to say is that smoking should be banned at least in the restaurants, but not everywhere. We should think for not only non-smokers but also smokers.",B2
"Nowadays, given the crises that our economy experiences, even students are compelled to work to be able to support themselves. Lucky for them, most universities allow specialized schedules which make the probabilities of the time allotment for their subjects and for their part-time jobs coincide lesser. Part-time workers are also usually not given heavy workloads; most part-time jobs involve only easy tasks such as tending to a cash register or keeping an inventory of stocks a retail business. As a student, I position myself halfway between agreeing and disagreeing. For me, a part-time job not only enables a student to gain income in order to support himself, but also trains him to be more responsible and more efficient in managing his time in order to be able to cope with harder tasks in the future. On the contrary, I, myself, also find it very hard to manage my time: cramming during the last minute, barely making the deadline and not bothering to do assignments at home â€“ I copy most of my assignments from my blockmates during breaks; so I think having to do two take care of these two things â€“ studying and working â€“ at once, must be a very hard thing to do. There is also less time to enjoy or do things at a leisurely pace if one decides to engage in a part-time job. At the end of the day, it is best considering the capabilities and the priorities of the students so as to make sure whether he will be able to handle tending to studying and working at once.

"Part time job plays an important role in college students' lives. There are a lot of reasons for getting a part time job. Some people need to earn money to support their family. Some people want to save money for their favorite clothes or notebooks. Some people just want to have such experiences to know what it is like after they graduate. However, no matter why you have a part time job and no matter what kind of job you have, all you need to do is to strike a perfect balance between your work and study. There are several examples that students work so hard that they forget they are still students. They go to work for 3-4 hours every day after school. They spend too much time on it to study any more. Surely, they are destined to be flunked and, to make matters worse, they cannot stay in college. However, it is not worth earning money instead of studying hard in their age. If they study hard and have sufficient knowledge, they are naturally well-prepared to get a better full-time job rather than a part-time job which offer little money. They need to study harder for their better future. To conclude, although students are encouraged to have a part-time job, because they can learn what are not in textbook and be more mature, they need to manage their time well.",B1
"Smoking is harmful for us. Though many people know this simple truth, they still smoke in public places, especially restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely at restaurants. Firstly, everyone knows that cigarettes have bad component which can cause cancer. So we should smoke less or we'd better not smoke cigarette whether we're at restaurants. Secondly, if one person smokes at restaurant, other people around him will be affected and those people may suffer the second hand smoke. In fact, it is unfair to the people who do not smoke. However, not only does the smoker damage his health, he also damages other people's health. In my view, no one should have the ""right"" to inflict a health hazard on anyone else. And it's necessary to ban smoking completely at all restaurants. Furthermore, if someone really wants to smoke, he can go outside and have a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he can come in. All in all, we should have the right attitude towards smoking. Though some people enjoy the pleasure which is brought by the smoking, we should recognize the harmful aspects of smoking. Smoking in public is not only a hazard for the smokers and every smoker must take responsibility for other people around. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned at all restaurants.",B1

"Recently, our teacher have given us a topic about weather people can smoke at a public place. In my opinion, the answer is certain no. The reasons are as follows. Firstly. Smoking at a public place will make the environment of the public place become dirty, What' more, the cigarette ash have much hazardous substance which will pollute the environment. So, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers. Secondly, at a public place, there are many people who do not smoke. so, if someone smoke at a public place, it will hurt other peoples' body. meanwhile, the strong-smelling of the cigarette is quite terrible to many other people who do not smoke. As we all know, cigarette have a lot of carcinogenic things. Therefore, that the government ban smoking at all public places is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. Some smokers often say that it takes away some of their freedom. But I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. All in all, people should not smoke at public place, which is no denying.",A2

Smoking is unhealthy for lungs. It let their lungs to work hard so their life might be shorter than others. Nowadays, we have noticed that the average of smoker age is lower.

"According to the researches done by scientists recent years, smoking is bad for not only the smokers themselves, but for the people around as well, which is usually called secondhand smoke. But as is often the case we see every day, people smoke no matter they are, such as restaurants, parks and even on public transportation, thus causing so many people trouble. On the one hand, smoking does harm to people related; on the other hand, smokers also leave others a bad impression. To solve this serious problem, many countries call on people to stop smoking in public, some of them even ban people from smoking in the restaurants. This causes a wide debate, for many hold the opinion that they are deprived of their basic civil rights of a free lifestyle. However, the majority agree with this policy, thinking that it protects the most of the people. Banning smoking is necessary, taking the significance of restaurants into account, for if we have our meals with Nicotine every day, we can't totally absorb the nutrition, let alone health. Also, as most of the people think, smoking in public means a lack of social morality to some degree. All in all, banning smoking is very necessary and important. I think if everyone quit smoking, the environment will be better and we will be healthier as well.",B1
"Smoking is a common activity for adults and teenagers. For adults, smoking is a past-time even if they know what could happen to them. Today, teenagers smoke because it is the trend. They think that if they don't smoke, they won't be cool or would get left out. Based on my experience, some smokers that I know learned smoking from their friends because they were pressured to do it. And as time passed by, they got used to it and got addicted more and more each day they smoked. Another reason why teenagers smoke is curiosity. Since we are young we tend to try new things. Because of our curiosity, we try smoking even without knowing what could happen to us. Some get influenced by family, advertisements and especially by the media Restaurant is a place for people to eat and socialize. They go to restaurants to satisfy themselves with food when they're hungry. It is really dangerous for people to smoke in restaurants because of health risks to every people who might inhale the smoke. It can affect the food that we are eating. The smoke might give bacteria to the food and drinks we intake that might cause sickness to every people and also destroy the good environment that the restaurant is located to. I believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants because for me it should have a right place to smoke not in a restaurant. I personally hate smoking especially in restaurants I don't feel well when I inhale smokes. It's really not good to the health of every people. In a restaurant different people are inside of it adults, teenagers, toddlers and I personally have care for them. If smoking can't be banned in a restaurant at least put a smoking area for every restaurant so it would be fair.",B1
"It is well known fact, that millions of people die every year from lung cancer as a result of smoking. So, many countries prohibit smoking in public places. However, some people think it disturb their individual freedom and selection. To my mind, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants and cafes must be banned. Restaurants are for eating, not smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from fume and smell. The scientists are sure that passive smoking is harmful for our health at the same value. Smoking is affected to our health. For example, when pregnant woman is smoking, she should understand that her unborned baby in the womb is smoking also. Moreover, his life can be at risk. Every year more and more babies are borning ill or even dead because of the bad habit of their mothers. Undoubtedly, there are a lot children and young people in different cafes and public places, and they do not have to see how adults smoke because they always learn and get experience from them. In the other hand, we live in democratic world and everyone has the right to do want he wants and this is a freedom. In fact, everyone must respect other people's feelings and we have to cooperate with each other. In conclusion I want to say that banning smoking is necessary measure for health of nation. In my opinion, we have to prohibit advertisement of tobacco on mass media and parents have to explain the damage of tobacco to their children. We all are responsible for future of our generations. Those countries, who had already forbidden smoking in public places had done a big step forward, compare to the countries who have not done it yet.",B1
"In my opinion, all restaurants in China should not completely ban smoking. Instead, it is necessary for most restaurants to set a smoking area to serve smokers and other restaurants to completely ban smoking. Although the majority of people support the assertion that smoking is harmful to smokers and people near them, in reality, there are still great amount of people in China who are smokers. Once all restaurants begin to ban smoking, smokers cannot stand the period in restaurants without any cigarettes. As a result, it is possible that large groups of heavy smokers give up to eat in restaurants and instead begin to eat at home or buy fast food, which will course great reduction of restaurants' profits. Thus to look round the corner, it is reasonable for restaurants to divide themselves into smoking area and non-smoking area, then smokers could enjoy their cigarettes after finishing their delicious dinner without complaint from non-smokers while non-smokers could appreciate their dinner without smoky air. As I know, the Show Coffee is among those restaurants which first begin to set smoking area and non-smoking area in China, which is largely welcomed by its customers. In addition, there are special restaurants with limited room for the division of different areas. Under this situation, all the customers' health is much more important that the smokers' addiction, so runners of those restaurants should completely ban smoking without any hesitation.",A2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As kwon to all, smoking is harmful to people. When you smoke, the tobacco burns and give off a lot off smokes that are harmful to your body especially to your lungs. A medical experiment shows that people who smoke a lot get lung cancer and other similar ills more than those who didn't smoke. So everyone should try their best not to smoke. What's worse, the medial experiment shows that one people smokes will do more harm to people beside him/her. Restaurants are public place, if you smoke, others will be affected. It's impolite to smoke in public places. If there are children eating, the smoke given off by tobacco will do more harm to them. Now, many developed countries have set series of lows to forbid people from smoking in public places, e. g. internet cafÃ©, restaurants, shopping center and so on. Then, why didn't we ask people not to smoke and just forbid them from smoking in restaurants and other public places? Because we must take steps one by one. Otherwise there will suddenly be lots of workers who have no job. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons. Firstly, we can know what society is by having a part-time job. When we have a job, we need to care about the manner, clothes, way of speaking and so on. If we know about them, they will help us in the future. Secondly, having a part-time job would give us an opportunity to think about the future. This is because there are various kinds of a part-time job. We can choose whichever we want to try. Some part-time jobs may be interesting for us but some may not. And we can know about ourselves. For example, what we like or not, what skill we have or not. Then we would think what we want to do after graduate a college. We also think what skill we should gain in order to prepare for the future. Lastly, we have to communicate with people who we've never met when we have a part-time job. So we don't have a lot of chances to communicate with new people. There are many people where we work and they are from other cities or schools. We would find many differences between us and them. In addition, we can learn how to communicate well with people and know the thing we don't know. Therefore I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B2
"There is no need for college students to have part time jobs because it would more often than not be a distraction from their studies. Furthermore, there is no need for students to stress themselves over part time jobs unless they have monetary issues, or unless they are working during their holidays. Even if they do have monetary issues, most schools should have aid for students to relief them of certain school fees and waiver costs of required items to ease the toll on parents. However, if it is the case that the student really has to work for his/her pocket money or to help with household expenditures, would it then be acceptable that s/he works part time. Working during the school holidays would also be acceptable as long as it does not interfere with their school curriculum. As this would promote independence and help the student prepare for his or her future. Other than these two reasons, college students should not let part time work be of distraction to their studies. The amount of school related stress from work and compulsory co-curricular activities is more than enough for a student to handle, which does not include study time as well as a student's own personal time. Even if a student admits to being able to juggle school work as well as a job, s/he should still not opt to work part time as studies would be more important as compared to a part time job. ",B1
"I think working part-time job for college students is a good thing. Because it will help their parents. May be a part, half, or all of their spend in whole semester. I think money that they receive from employer as much as full-time job, but it is one way to help their parents. When they working and find the money with themselves, it is a pride of themselves too. They know spending money, realize the money, sufficient, etc. Working while they are studying of college students are not only for get the money, but it is a find experience before they see the real work after graduate. People who have experience before this, they will solve the problem, have a planning, and ready to work in different situations that will happen in the future. The best way to find a part-time job should choose work that fit with yourself, fit with major that you have studied, or work that you like the most. If you like your job then you will work better than the work that you do not like. You will do very well. I agree with this topic because if I have a chance I want to work part-time job too. I think it can help our parents. May be a little, but I think I have a pride of myself if I can find amount of money.",B1
"In high school, most of the school doesn't suggest their students for doing the part time job. I think that's because some of the students who was doing a part time job still couldn't manage their time effectively. In fact, their score are decreasing because of that. We are students whose first priority is studying. If part time job give bad effect to our score, I think it is better to stop doing a part time job. But now, we are college students. We have to manage our time wisely. We should consider that doing a part time job can give us many advantages. With part time job, we can help our parent for searching for money. And, instead of collecting money, experience is more wonderful present we got from doing the part time job. Experience can help us doing many things and making a conclusion. Experience is required too in searching for the real job. Nowadays, there are many college students that do part time job beside college and doing well in both college and part time job. If we could do them both, don't be hesitated. Do both college and part time job. It really gave us precious experience we need. It is important for college students to have a part time job.",B1
"Smoking is a bad habit. Different people smoke with different types like some people smoke cigarettes, cigaroor, huka. Smoking is injurious to us. As on the pocket of cigarette there is written same wors that smoking is very dangerous for health and it can cure cancer disease. The smoke produce from cigarrrete and ciger also from Huka's can cause. Pollution in air which can also our lungs skin and many other body parts. In Pakistan smoking is increase rapidly. Many people is smoking while sitting in restaurant near the streets or roads. They are smoking outside the house because they do not want to tell their relatives that they smoke. Mostly in Pakistan gents are smoking. Now a days in the small restaurants near the roads there are many types of cigarettes present instead if presence of food or healthy things for health. Children in Pakistan also smoke cigarettes from hiding their parents and in this way they can damage or destroy their internal body parts because the internal body parts of the children are very sensitive and they can immediately by effected by these types of germs. Mostly people are smoking in the restaurant where the aged ant teen agers are also present. Smoking can cause different types of disease like lungs cancer, skin cancer. Smoking also effect the lips. We should be avoid the smoking especially the children should not be smoke because these children are the future of Pakistan and if this generation is destroy then all the country will destroy. So, smoking should be banned not only in restaurant but all over the country.",B1
"Nowadays, college students want to have a part-time job during their study periods. In my opinion, I think everything has two aspects like one coin has two sides. On the one hand, if you want to gain more experiences in society, to have a part-time job is a good way, but on the other hand, in case you pay more attention on your part-time job that you don't have enough times on your study lessons, for a college student, study is most important for a student. Most college students believe a part-time job can support their more job chances in the future, and it also can improve a person's confidence and responsibility. So in this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. There are other college students believe that college is a study place, so they consider that if we spend much time in doing a part-time job, we may delay our school works, in this aspect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. From now on, college becomes more and more market focus and a college student must be provided with variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities.",A2

"Smoking is a bad habit. It becomes a bad habit because smoking is very dangerous for the smokers and people around them. The smokers are called the active smokers and people around them who do not smoke but inhale the smoke are called the passive smokers. As we know that smokers inhale the cigarette. And cigarette has a lot of effects. Cigarette contains a lot of danger substances, such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxside, etc. For the active smokers, it can cause mouth cancer, impotency, liver cancer, pregnant and foetus risk, heart attack, etc. And for the passive smokers, it can cause asthma, cough, even death when they inhale the smoke. In this era, it will be very difficult to ban smoking, although the government and other organizations have published that smoking is banned or haram in Indonesia. So, the government should ban smoking in the public area, especially in the restaurant. Restaurant is a place that people have their breakfast or lunch or dinner or supper. Of course, while they are enjoying their food, they must not be disturbed with the smoke. To avoid the effects, restaurant's manager must supply a separate smoking area. So, the restaurant visitors will not be disturbed and the smokers can smoke everytime they want without harming the others.",B1
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. For modern college students, it is useful to have a part-time job. There are many benefits of having a part-time job. Students who have a part-time job are easier to be accepted by enterprises. To modern enterprises, diploma is not the only way to text the employee, working experience is become more and more important when a leader decides whether the employee to get the job or not. For example, a graduate with high diploma but no working experience and another with a common diploma but have rich experience, which one would you like? If I'm the leader, I'll choose the second without hesitation. Maybe someone will oppose me, students' duty is study, isn't it? I think that's middle school's students' duty, and college students' duty is not only study but learn more principles when you live. Have a part-time job is a good chance to learn!To me, I really want to have a part-time job, but I never find it because I'm too lazy. I think many students just like me, they are to lazy to have a part-time job. In a word, I'll try, if I find a job fit me, I'll do that!",A2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all at the restaurant in Japan because I h ave three below the opinion. First thing is that cigarette has it itself. It is the effect of passive smoking. Passive smoking injures the people around a smoker without their volition. And passive smoking has more harmful than active smoking. Second, now most restaurant separate smoking seat and nonsmoking one. But it cannot separ ate SMOKE. It floats anywhere. Only perfect locked room can do it, however, it doesn't real ize in the restaurant in Japan. And more smoking seat often is near the bathroom in the Japa nese restaurant. So many people-baby, child, pregnant woman, and elder- have to pass near th e smoking seat, of course, if they don't smoke. I mean, nonsmokers feel so bad because of s mokers. It resemble that the noise of in the train. For example, the loudly talk, the leak o f sound from earphone and the call on the cell phone. Finally, the climate in Japan is becoming Non-smoking. I was scared the light of cigare tte. This words is said by small boy and girl on the poster. In Japan now the goverment im poses a duty on cigarettes. And already, smoking seats is excluding from many places. And first of all, smoking harms the smokers very much...",A2
"I have been employed as a part-time student helper in school for about six months now. I help out in the Publishing Technology Center to the photographer and student helper for the Student Affairs Office by doing different tasks from time to time. I think that it is important for university students to have a part-time job as this may act as their first work experience (if they do not have any), before going out in the society. Although having a part-time job make take away some students' precious studying time, there is much to learn from having a part-time job. As for me, because I have a passionate interest for photography, being a helper to the photographer has allowed me to learn a lot of skills that I would not be able to learn outside. It allows us to be involved in this'extra curriculum' other than just academic. If the job is within our field of study, it is even better as we would have a head start in our future job than other applicants who do not have this experience. We also get to experience the working conditions of an actual workplace. Students could also learn to be independent by earning some money as their allowance rather than taking from their parents. I would strongly recommend university students to have a part-time job.",B1
God has sent us in this world with a great purpose. And our holy prophet (PBUH) was a also sent with this purpose which was teaching and learning. In the beginning is it was very easy to get knowledge but with the passage of time it has become very difficult to acquire it. Because of the expenses of the study. People are facing lot of problem because of their earning and it is very difficult for them to manage daily bread. But as we know this is age of science and technology. Everybody wants to get more and more education. But due to insufficient income of their parents and some other worse circumstances they have to do part time jobs to meet their expenses. That's why these many students are doing part time job during their studies. It is very difficult for them to manage two very tiresome task. They are compelled to do part time jobs but it is necessary for them. The adverse circumstances taught them lot of things about like during their studies. They become very mature at very early age. But it is very sad because they can't pay full attention towards their studies. Sometime some students do very hard jobs which made them very much fatigue. And after doing some hard job they can't do their studies properly. It is very sad because our government is not doing something in this regard. As the days are passing the expenditure of studies is going increase. The Govt. should give some cession to the students in studies or at last provide some suitable jobs which are not very hand or difficult. And it should not be like that who prove students just to get money. And they deliberately don't pay full attention to their studies or left it incomplete.,B2
" Smoking addiction among people has been a big concern, considering it causes great harm to people's health little by little. So, I must argue that smoking should be banned in public places, especially restaurants. There are several reasons to support my opinion. Primarily, smoking poses series health problems to the smokers themselves. Most smokers get lung diseases because of smoking. What's worse, smoking will decrease people's immune system, causing people get ill more easily. Although the cigarette boxes are printed smoking is bad for health, smokers continue to smoke. Since the number of people addicted to smoking is so huge and the number is still climbing, we can sense it is high time for us to stop people smoking. One of the efficient ways to solve this problem is banning smoking in restaurants. And the harmful air that smokers breath leads to immense harm to the nonsmokers' health. In restaurants', there are many nonsmokers eating, adding the fact that the air in restaurants does not flow quickly, the smoke makes nonsmokers suffer even greater. In conclude, smoking is bad for both smokers and nonsmokers health, we must ban smoking in restaurants.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays, more restaurants in Japan separate nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. However, nonsmoking seats often become full soon and people who don't smoke have to sit smoking seats. I hate smoke of cigarette. It smells bad and penetrates into clothes. In addition, it makes me have a sore throat. For instance, guess that you have a dinner with your family cheerfully. On that time, if a man who smokes next to your table, smell of cigarette will spoil your delicious dishes and make you feel unpleasant. When I see a man smoking in a public place, I get angry very much. Smoking, of course, makes smokers unhealthy. Moreover, smoke of cigarette has a bad influence on people who don't smoke. Smoking makes a possibility of getting cancer high. There may be a pregnant mother or a baby in a restaurant. And so if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, people who dislike a cigarette can enjoy themselves without being irritated about other's smoke. What is more, smokers have less opportunities of smoking and so, they can become healthy. I hope smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country soon.",B1
"I agree with this statement for several reasons. Smoking has been proven many times to have a large impact on the health of people, including smokers themselves and those around them. It is absurd to allow people to inflict damage in the form of passive smoking upon others who choose not to smoke. Each year there are numerous cases of health problems caused by second hand smoke which impacts the economy due to increased health expenditure from the government. It is therefore necessary to take steps to reduce these issues as much as possible, and banning smoking in all restaurants is a step to achieving that. Enclosed spaces facilitate the spread of smoke and of course restaurants are enclosed spaces yet it is not just restaurants where it should be banned ? all indoor public places should be no-smoking areas much like several countries in Europe and parts of America. Focusing on restaurants, it is not only the health aspect we should consider. There is also the issue of hygiene and pollution. Smoking is a dirty habit. The ash spreads easily, potentially contaminating food at worst, or being a mild nuisance at best. The smoke itself has an unfavorable odor for non-smokers and smokers alike. The smell of tobacco while eating can be enough to ruin the appetite of a 40-a-day chain-smoker let alone a non-smoker. It is therefore in the best interests of restaurant owners to encourage the image of cleanliness in their establishments by banning smoking.",C2
"College is the most difficult level of education in one's life and it may also be the most expensive. It would be burdensome for the one who is making someone go to a university especially if he/she has a low income. The budget for necessities and education is just adequate and even insufficient so there would be no allotment for other miscellaneous. Attending college requires a lot of expenses regardless of your tuition fees like costumes for plays, materials for projects etc. so you need some source of income in order to finance all of that. Having a part time job is the solution to that problem. Part time jobs have many types one of which is working at a store or restaurant. Applying in that job suites for people who are hardworking and friendly. Another type of part time job is selling foods or pastries for the people who want to cook or bake. The last example for a part time job would be selling handicrafts and self-made accessories to those creative ones. Engaging in a part time job is helpful for college students because they have the opportunity to test what they are learning in school and evaluate what skills or knowledge they still need to know. Also, having the first salary and realizing that you paid something out of your effort and hard work may be your greatest fulfillment in your life. Part time job would help one's parents in bills and develop one's talent and capability.",B1
"I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I don't smoke and don't want to breathe the smoke that someone blows, but this idea is very excessive. We should take smoker's feelings into consideration, and that idea completely ignores their feelings. Certainly, I can understand the idea that no-smokers want to keep away smoke from them, because I sometimes think so. Tobacco's smoke has many problems. For example tobacco's smoke does a lot of damage to our health. The possibility that you may get cancer and a lot of other illness increases very much by breathing tobacco's smoke. In addition to this fact, smoke does the same damage to secondary smoker, so no-smoker but secondary smoker is as good as smoker. From a viewpoint of no-smoker, that they can't allow existence of smoke is convinced. Smoker enjoys smoking and look forward to smoking, but when they go to a restaurant, if smoking is completely banned, they can't enjoy and relax. Considering both sides' opinion, the idea that we make the smoking place that is completely isolated from no-smoking places and of course they can eat is best. Restaurants should be the place that all people enjoy and relax, so smoker should care about no-smoker's feelings and no-smoker mustn't exclude smoker from restaurant.",B1
"I agree with the voice that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons I think so. The One is that I think the smoke of tobaccos is make dishes not delicious. If I was the cook, I want to eat the dishes on the best condition. I do not smoke and I do not like the smoke. So I think, for who do not like smoke, the smoke is the bad thing which the condition make bad. I do not know how smokers feel about the smoke, but there are more people who are not smoking than people who are smoking. In the stands of the shop, for make the restaurant better, we should considerate about majority. And the other reason is that we cannot separate the area for smoking and for no smoking in perfectly. Some of restaurants separate the area to smoking and no-smoking but I think it is not good. In the many case, the separation do not cover all. So In the seat in no-smoking area but near the smoking area, we feel the smell of the smoke of tobacco. Because of these two reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. With the following ideas, I would like to briefly elaborate the reasons why. There are three main reasons. First, part-time job give students a good chance to interact with people outside the campus. It is a progress of learning to adapt the future lifestyle, as well as taking the step of knowing the society. The progress of learning plays an essential part in each of our life, especially for college students who are going to graduate and start joining the company and work. Second, getting a part-time job help students establish their way of living in the society. It is a process for one to learn to take more responsibility as becoming a more mature adult. By taking more responsibility, I mean taking more considerations before making decisions or taking actions, as well as being responsible for any out coming results. Last but not least, having a part time job can be seen as a series of trainings. Through the trainings, students develop their own and appropriate way to deal with all sorts of issues. Also, by building up their own way of managing all kinds of tasks, students get a clearer idea about how to face the problems in the future. Besides studying, having a part time job in college can surely give students a picture of how the work, or how the world they are going to enter look like. Additionally, part-time job is a great opportunity for us to take what we have learned in to practical. It is important to have knowledge, but it is also important to know how to use the knowledge. Thus, I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"I strongly support the banning of smoking at all the restaurants in the country. When I go on the street, I saw some people who smoke. Smokers have freedom to smoke. So outside of the public room, non-smokers cannot criticize them. But I dislike smoke very much. In spite of the moment of walking on the street for the short time, I feel very uncomfortable and hateful to that smoke. This is the reason why at that time I run fast stuffing my nose and mouth. In the reastant the smoke can be much more sensitive. Because smoking can interefere the clear environment of restaurant where we have a good time eating the delicious food. On top of that, the food can be polluted by the smoke chemicals. Therefore, smokers have to keep the public courtesy in the restaurant. If we have to respect the smokers in the restaurant, it is good idea to make the smoke-room in there. Smoke-room is only the place where smokers can be in. On the reason that they smoke one another, they can not be careful of smoke, Smoking is allowed in that space. In this way, smoke-room can be solution to respect the smokers in the restaurant. Were it not for that smoke-room, smokers can rigidly follow the rule that they must not smoke. The scientific research shows that indirect smoke are harmful to the health. Smokers can have a bad influence of the nonsmokers as well as themselves. They have to be careful because we are the member of the community.",B2
"I agree strongly about smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country because it is very dangerous, make everyone have not healthy body and mind and it has a bad consequence such as 1. It can make people be cancer in their lung. 2. It will make everyone that be around who is smoking may run away. 3. Its smoke will disturb all activities that people are doing. 4. It makes money decrease rapidly if we always smoke. 5. It makes food or beverage have a bad smell and look disgust. The government should manage about this immediately. By campaign smoking cigarette such as 1. Make people change their mind by running every day instead of smoking. 2. There are signs ""Don't smoke here"" in the restaurant or every place to warning who is smoking cancel to do this. 3. There are special places for smoking. 4. Stop selling cigarette for people who stand around the restaurant. Moreover, family is part of campaigning smoking.

I really sure that people in country will have a good healthy.",B1
"I agree with ""Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. "" First, Restaurant is a place for people to enjoy, to relax and to reunion with family and friends. Restaurant is not a place for people to smoke, nor a place for innocent people to inhale bad smelling secondhand smoke that ruins the pleasant atmosphere. Why do people have to pay for something they don't like? Second, the taste of food may change due to the environment; an ice-cream in a bathroom won't be delicious as the one on the beach. Same things refer to the food in the restaurant, dishes that are covered by smoke won't be as tasty as the original one, and that is absolutely not the chef to blame. Third, According to medical references, we know that if a pregnant woman inhale secondhand smoke, it may cause serious problem to the baby inside. Secondhand smoke is also bad for the growing of teenager kids, and causes human to have respiration problems and cancer more easily. If every happy gathering turns out to be a harmful trap, what will the world be like? So in my opinion, for the good mood while eating, for the tasty of food and for the health of human, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Till now, smoking has already become a significant issue in the country. If you roam on the street, you will find in surprise that nearly half of the citizens are used to smoking in public, even youngsters are among them. Hitherto, smoking have grabbed billions of money from one generation and murdered hundreds of thousands of people. Now, the Pluto turns to the younger generation, the teenagers. As a result, many professors hope government to pass proper laws to ban smoking in public places, especially at the restaurants. In my opinion, banning smoking at all the restaurants is essential. Since smoking may not only do harm to the smokers, but also influence partners' health. What's more, when person is eating, one is sitting in one place and not moving. With the limited space at the restaurants, smoking can greatly damage another's body. To some degree, if a person enjoying supper with smoking smog around, he or she is supposed to lose several days life. This is a sobering fact, while the most of citizens are blind to the truth. Smokers are enjoying the cigarettes, while others are enjoying dinner in the killing smog. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, for our later generations don't leave more time for us.",B1
"I agree that it is important but for some students, it might not be in their best interest to wok while they are trying to study. Perhaps in their case, they may be finding it too challenging to work and their studies are suffering because of it. In this situation and if money is not the only motivating factor, they may be able to stop working at their part-time jobs and get caught up or in control of their study time again. Quite frankly though, I genuinely believe that nearly all students would gain more value from college by leaving all the outside influences behind and just direct their efforts towards college only activities and studies. It is unrealistic to insist that these kinds of students need to work or that it is important for them, because clearly it would be unsuitable in their case and would be causing them hardships that could quite possibly be avoided. While there are a few benefits that could be gained from working part-time as in the previous case scenario, the negatives I that case would outweigh any positive gains and therefore, would not always be appropriate or important for them. Which is not to say that it wouldn't always be good for others.",C2
" I don't agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in China. I'm not a smoker, and I don't like people smoking around me. But I still don't think it is not a good idea to completely forbid people smoking at the restaurants in China. On one hand, smoking is not forbidden by the whole society. All the countries have no such laws that completely forbidding smoking. Though nicotine makes people get addicted, making people die earlier. This is quite similar as drugs. The reason that tobacco has never been banned is that great amount of taxes are paid by the smokers and tobacco companies. This has been a important part of all the tax income to the governments. So rights are given to the people. Smoking is not about affecting people nearby, it's more like a right of freedom and fairness. Since governments never banned smoking, in my opinion, dividing guests into smoking area and non-smoking area at the restaurants would be a great idea for now. But I am looking forward to the day that all tobacco is forbidden all over the world, not only in Chinese restaurants.",B1
" In recent years, more and more public places such as some restaurants and pubs announced a ban on smoking. This tendency attracts much attention and caused a social debating. Many people especially those smokers think this limit their legal rights and require no ban for smoking. But more people agree on it. I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but do you know that living with a smoker is even more harmful? The scientific research shows that the second-hand smoke is much more harmful than smoke a cigarette directly. So smoking in public places can do harm to others health. So in my opinion, no smoking in public places is fair and legal. The second point is that smoking in public can have bad influence especially on young people. Children lack the ability of judgment and like to imitate adults. So they are more likely to smoke when they grow up or even before they grow up. Ban on smoking can teach them a good lesson: smoking is bad, don't touch it. Smoking in public places is dangerous. It can set things on fire and cause disasters. Many people lost their lives because of a cigarette. According to these reasons, I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. No smoking makes a healthier and more harmonious society.",B1
"Nowadays there has been an increasing tendency for college school students to take a part time job, causing a hit discussion between our class. We are divided on this issue. Some of us are firmly concerned that taking a part job has no good for us students, claiming that it is too early for us to step into the society. They believe study is second to none in importance for college students, and part time job is a waste of time because it takes a lot of our limited time and energy. Others, however, have a brief that it is both necessary and helpful for us to take a part time job, considering we can learn a lot of lessons that we cannot learn in books when we work. Besides part time job can earn us some money to ease the pressure on our parents. For me part, I agree with the latter point. In my point of view, we can come to understand the hardness of making money, making us to treasure the money we get form our parents. Taking a part time job does not necessarily have conflicts with study in time, concerning we have andante leisure time. What is more, it can also make our college life more colorful.",B1
"Part time job for college students is not a healthy activity for those who are doing it unnecessary. Because by this although they can fulfill their desires of doing any part time job but they cannot focus on their studies bitterly. It affects their studies and they are passing through their career building stage and at this stage they should completely focus on their studies for their better future. But if that can manage their studies and job properly, they should do it, because by doing job the students who are idol get a healthy activity for their spare time. Some students are compelled to part time jobs. Although they are not mentally and physically able to do such jobs but because of some financial problems of their family, they are compelled to do jobs to rise their family to some extent by going small contribution to solve financial problem of their family. Students which are facing poverty and wanted to study do part time job to pay their college dues and to carry their studies. By doing part time jobs, their studies and health also got affected as all this work is high to thin physical and mentally potentials. By doing hand labor their health also got effect which result a bad effect on their studies also. Government should do something for such students by making policies and funds rising, so, that students got focused on their studies properly and contributes towards a bright future of their country.",B1
"By looking at the word ""smoking"", we are understood that it causes so many problems. Smoking is injuries for health because when a person inhale or exhale smokes from cigarettes, cigars pipes then it effects on lungs. There are thousand of chemicals founds in cigarettes smoke, some of which are harmful to our body. Lung cancer, emphysema and chronic bronchitis are some examples of the effects of the smoking. Many people died at the early ages due to the smoking effects. It is a common experience that when we are sitting in a restaurants and someone started to smoke a cigarettes we become a second-hand smoker. Therefore, I wish many times smoking should be banned in the public places especially in the restaurants. Because smoke is not only unpleasant but it is also unhealthy, so smoker not only damages his own health but also of others. A lot of people argue that smokers have their right that we are living in democratic country. And they said that prohibits the smoking in restaurants is against the personal rights of the smokers. But these people don't know that smokers have no right to become a cause of death for others due to the side effects of smoke of their cigarettes. People come with their families in the restaurants for launch, dinner and for taking meal and for recreation with their family outside from their homes. At the same time, if someone is smoking then its smoke causes to pollute the environment. It caused bad effects on the health of people while they are enjoying their meal. Therefore, smoking should be banned in the restaurants.",B1
"I agree and would support bans of this nature anywhere. The question is would the Japanese Government be prepared to back it up if they were to introduce a restaurant ban on smoking? The reason that I ask, is that there is sure to be some sort of uproar from the huge smoking population that Japan has. If the government were to prohibit smoking in restaurants, how would they police and enforce it? There is no doubt in my mind that bans of this nature help to protect other restaurant goers. But I wonder whether or not the government would back down if enough citizens protested on this particular issue? Even though ninety-nine percent of the free world knows and accepts the dangers of smoking and passive smoking, there are some who still shed a tear or have some sympathy for the smokers. Maybe they are friends of theirs or relatives, I have no idea but the bottom line is that we must all keep the greater good of all in mind and sometimes it is necessary to make tough decisions that will be far from popular. It is important that we stand fast when we know what is in the best interests of the majority.",C2
"Currently, in the college have many students came from poor family. They don't have money enough to spend about their studying.

"Many countries have restrictions on the quantity of cigarettes or tobacco that can be brought into the country. In many countries, tobacco products are taxed heavily, so travelers importing more than a few packets of these products should expect to pay import duties. On the other hand, many countries also have facilities that permit departing travelers to purchase these same products, duty free, at the border, as they leave the country. People who smoke products other than tobacco should be aware that cannabis and other recreational substances are prohibited in many countries. Some countries impose severe penalties for attempting to import even a small quantity. If you are found in possession - and some cases even carrying implements that can be, or have been, used for smoking these products - you may be arrested and imprisoned, possibly for life. In Asia, particularly in China, smoking is still something of a social activity, at least for men. Anyone with cigarettes will offer them around before he lights up; having an expensive brand is a status symbol. Female smokers may be thought odd; more men and fewer women smoke in Asia than in Western countries. Restaurants do not usually have non-smoking areas; many do not have ashtrays either. Areas such as bus stations may have ""no smoking"" signs, but these are often ignored. Non-smokers should be prepared to endure smoky rooms. Even in China, though, this is slowly changing. Smoking is now forbidden in many restaurants, at least in major cities.",B1
"Smoking is rapidly increasing in the world. It is a bad habit. It is affecting whole world. Migrate, vain, drinking becomes a fashion of the day.

"I believe that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. First, as university students must pay the expensive tuition and use money for lunch or transport fee, so, they can do a part time job to lighten the burden of their family. Moreover, having a part time job can get some experiences. The university students can choose the part time job that can help them to prepare their future career. These experiences can widen their view. For example, if they be a tutor of the primary student or secondary student, they can learn how to teach children and how to prepare material for the children during the lessons. In addition, being a university student is not same as a secondary student, so, doing the part time job is a addition task for university students to arrange their time table. In the university, there are some job for them to do, for example, being a librarian or being a helper of some program. They should use these few years to learn how to arrange their time table that not same as secondary school. In conclusion, having a part time job is important for university students.",B2
"I agree because smoking in public is disturbing another people. Especially in the restaurant. People smoking for varies different reason some one smoking because they street out or they think they cool or very attractive for other people. But they don't think to another people that they make annoying to them especially people who don't smoke or they got allergies of smoke. It should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Cigarette and smoke can be effect to people who smoke inhaled because they inhaled smoke more than smoker. Completely banned smoking at public place it can help other people who do not smoke. And stop smoker to reduce smoking than past. For smoker, you must to quit smoking for your health and your mind. Stop smoking for your family and our social. If you can stop smoking, not only others will be happy, yourself will be healthy and you can live longer and not taking rise for having cancer. For restaurant, the owner should separate the place for smoking and non-smoking area. Don't let smokers go into the restaurant, you may lose other customers especially the air condition restaurant. The smell of the cigarettes will destroy the air, and smell of food. Therefore, everyone should consider what should we do with stop people having smoking in restaurant and public areas.",B1
"I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All people can do to go to the restaurant, and All people do not smoking. So smoker is less than that. therefore, they can not smoking at all the restaurants. Such as, if one family visit to the restaurant. They are 4 members in the family: father, mother, one boy, and baby girl. And there are many smokers, so smokers are near the family. We can defend our health, happiness, and freedom. Maybe, young boy will learn smoking to smoker and baby will drink air with smoke from smoker. Young boy and baby can be your sun and daughter, It is very danger and make to get angry to you. Next, some countries use fire on the table, such as Korean soup, Japanese soup, and United Kingdom royal dessert. So, Today, In this food restaurants, we can see fire on the table. If you smoke in there space, your smoke fire is near gas. We know smoking near fire is very danger.

"We do know that smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Every year, millions of people die of lung cancers due to smoking. Smoking is damaging people every day. Yet, smoking should not be banded completely at all the restaurants in China. My views are as follows. Things that exist must have values. In China's long history, smoking dates back to centuries ago. There must be reasons why so many people smoke. Smoking can make people have a good break after exhausting physical work. Also, many women say that they feel safe when they smoke. Artists say that they have flash ideas when they smoke. Writers also say they can not write down any word without smoking. Many people also have the habit of smoking during meals. If people can not drop the habit, why not produce cigarettes with higher qualities? It will be harmless of they don't breathe in the toxic nicotine. Smoking should be reduced but not banned completely. Many people say they can not do anything without cigarettes. Thus, it will not be a good idea to ban smoking. People who smoke during meals will feel that nothing is tasty if they are banned smoking. It would be better that we accept that fact and think of ways to solve the problem. In summary, banning smoking is not the only way to solve problems. Change an angle to think. Producing better and healthier cigarettes way be of vital importance.",B1
"Restaurants in where all people enjoy dishes are not private place but public place. It is various people in there; adults and children, family and couple, gentle men and women, noisy men and women, smoker and non-smoker, for instance. So if you have lunch in restaurant, you should think feelings of around people in there. If you are smoker, it is most important that think thinking of non-smoker. In fact, I think smoke of cigarettes harm taste of foods. And smoke of cigarettes harms growth of children in restaurant. People who want to smoke should smoke out of room after mealtime. Then smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For example, McDonald's near my home prohibits smoking in store because McDonald's think that smoke is obstacle for good taste of hamburger. It is very good idea! And it is truth for smoker that smoke harms dishes. So in now, some restaurants have sheets for smoker, but all restaurants should abolish the sheet, if they want all people to enjoy good dishes. Finally I want all restaurants to prohibit smoking in it and all people agree this thinking and enjoy food and conversation peaceful, cheerful in it.",A2
"I don't agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at all. This is not because I am a smoker. In fact, I don't smoke at all and hate smoking. Then, there are some reasons why I think so. These days, it is very often said that smoking is not good for our health and smoking tend to get a cancer. However, many people smoke in spite of the advice. In addition, there is an opinion that when nonsmokers breathe the smoke of cigarette, nonsmokers tend to get a cancer more than smoker tend to do. Only because of these reasons, it is too one-sided to adapt smoker to nonsmoker. In restaurants, if they ban smoking in all areas, people who want to smoke can't smoke and if they put up with smoking, they can't enjoy themselves and maybe they feel bad. I think that it is good to make the partition wall or the partition room that separate smokers from nonsmokers. When we do it, it isn't one-sided and it is a fair solution, I think. In restaurants these days, some make such things and shop assistants ask us whether we smoke or not or which seats we sit down. So, it is nice to be complete. Therefore, there is no necessity to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2

"I think that it is important for college students to have part-time job because part-time job may give them precious experiences. First of all, they could know work is very hard and important. They could notice that their parents do works everyday for their family. And they may thank their parents. We can't live without works. Second, they are taught importance of money by getting salary by their self. Most of them may often save money when they go shopping because they don't want to lose the money they get hard. They may plan how to use it, for example traveling, shopping and their hobby. Third, their experiences will be useful when they get a job after graduate from their college. They could practice works in real atmosphere and know a lot of systems in working situation. Also they are given many chances to find work they want to do by doing many kind of part-time job. However they have to study in college life. They passed entrance exam to study many subjects at college. But it is important for college students to have part-time job, they should have part-time job not to disturb their study. As a result of these things they could also use time well.",A2
"I strongly believe that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs especially those related with their degree / major in order to broaden their knowledge in the field they're in. It is not only work experience that the student can benefit or get, students would also learn on how to earn money they worked har d for to sustain their needs, help their parents financially, especially those in the middle and lower class families who are financially unstable. Likewise, there are students who are financially stable but they don't want to bother their parents for some reason so they work and at the same time, study. There are students who want to buy the things they want to but they don't want to bother their parents so they work to earn the money they need. There are many reasons why college students get part-time jobs while studying and some of them are stated above. We don't know why students work while studying, but mostly, they work to help their parents financially AND if they wish to apply for jobs in the near future, they would have an advantage that they have work experience related to their degree.",B1
"For long has smoking been a disputable social problem, and I think it's high time that we draw a conclusion and take action towards it. I agree to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country for the following reasons. First, smoking has nowadays become one of the most serious pollutions. In China, about 3/4 of population is found out to be the victim of second-hand smoke. And when we find out that the rest 1/4 is who that smokes, we have to acknowledge the dangerous situation we are faced with, that is, there is the toxic gas form cigarettes in every home. Can we just stand here and see this going on? No! Second, public places can be easily polluted by smoke. So it's reasonable that we first take step to protect these places form smoke. We eat in restaurant everyday, and we definitely don't want the disgusting smoke to ruin our appetite while enjoying the delicious food. Think about it, you step into a restaurant and expect to enjoy a good meal but only to find the whole room filled with smokes, what a bad day! Last but not least, kids are most easily to be harmed by smokes. Will you want you child to be exposed to the toxic gases? So let's take action and make our world a better place!",B2
" Nowadays, more and more people smoke. When you walk on the street you can see people smoking, when you are shopping in the shops you also can see people smoking, you can see the scenery in many places, but whether we should ban smoking in the restaurant. Different people have different views about this question. In my opinion we should ban smoking in the restaurant because it is where people eat food and have a rest there. If someone smoke there it can affect other people, people' emotion can be bad then so they may not come to the restaurant to have meals any more. And we all know smoking is very bad for our health. It can cause smokers to have some disease. Non-smokers sit around them when they smoke can also have some diseases. So smoking should be banned in the restaurant to keep everyone safe and healthy. Smoking in public is also a bad thing, it can affect your personal image. Children in the restaurant may learn from your example. But sometimes there are many people in the restaurant so people have to wait for a long time to have meals so they feel very boring to smoke, it needs restaurants to take actions to improve the efficient. In a word, I agree with the opinion that we should ban smoking in the restaurant.",B1
"I agree that. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because two reasons. First, we must study except for academic things, too. After graduation, many of them will be pushed for time as a true member of society. But it's very hard to take part in a society without arrangements. So I think we should have a part-time job as arrangements of a member of society. There are many important things which we can study only through the working. And we must know how money is precious. If we live by only parent's income, and get allowances, we can't realize real value. However we understand its value in mind, it's nonsense. Seeing is believing. We can realize it precious only own experience. Second, I think we should do something while we are college students because for many students campus life is final time which they can use freely. For example traveling abroad, to learn how to drive, however they are very expensive. So we need a lot of money. But its true value rise when we carry out from preparation of money to practice on our own. I think we can spend time efficiently this series of flow by having a part-time job. 4 years is too short to waste.",A2
" Nowadays more and more Chinese college students begin to find the importance of independence, maybe because they could learn more from the abroad. So the question about college students doing part time jobs has been heated discussed. As teens, almost adults in terms of age, we not only have the energy but also have the faith that to feed us just by ourselves, which is also the signal to being a true adult owing respect both from the family the school but from the society. So trying to find some part time jobs to do is sometimes regarded as an important step to enter the society. But at the same time, we can't make it good to find the suitable job or solve other problems as we are faced with the society at first time and have little experience. Also there are many cases on the crime that teens were used to do terrible things by some adults. What's more, if students use more time in studying, they may get more than washing dishes. So to sum up, we are supposed to think twice before we want to get some part time jobs.",A2
" Personally, I totally agree with this statement. And I have two points here to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking in public places, such as restaurants, is really harmful to the public health. It is widely acknowledged that the second-hand smoking could do significant harm to the people around you. What's more, being a decent person in this developing society requires every individual to take the responsibility to the whole community in every occasion. Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurant is necessary and it can contribute to both the public health and showing our respect to others. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants can help to achieve a graceful environment for enjoying a tasty meal and communication. Apparently, in some cases, people go to restaurants for communication rather than food alone. And the stingy smell, such as smoke, can definitely disturb the atmosphere of talking. Anyway, banning smoking at all the restaurant does not indicate that it is inhuman or inconsiderate, having noticed in some restaurants that they provided the customers a rest room to handle their personal need for release themselves. Based on those two points I have stressed, I'm in favor of the policy: Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.",B1
"Cigarette smoke contains over 4, 000 chemicals. Of those chemicals, 40 of them have been proven to cause cancer (SWAT). It's no wonder why a bill is being passed to ban smoking in all public places. However, this will have the greatest effect on restaurants across the nation. The next great smoking debate will decide whether you can ""puff"" in restaurants. In a democracy, like the one we live in, the majority rules, while trying to respect the rights of the minority. In this case, the minority being smokers, seem to have more rights than the majority. But the majority has taken it into their owns hands and passed a bill to ban smoking in all public places. The ban would only apply to the common areas of the restaurants, especially if the dining areas were enclosed and had a separate entrance. Smoking, however, might be prohibited in a lobby if a nearby restaurant wasn't enclosed. The restaurants should consider how to manage the place for smoking as well as place for eating. That shouldn't be together. I agree to ban smoking in the restaurants but as the same way it is doesn't need to be all restaurants if they can manage well.",A2
"Having a part time job as a college student is important because it serves as a training for us even though we need to balance our study and work. I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help us as a college students to find the ideal job more easily in the future. And we can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in our future working circumstance. We as a college students, we can also expand our interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I have read an article; it said, Without friends, we will not do anything perfectly. I have the same thought that Interpersonal relationship is really important in our daily life. Many people will think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help us as a college students in the future to become much better, no matter in the attitude toward money, in getting working experiences, or in interpersonal relationship.",B1
Part time job for college student are good for part time for college students are not good. Because it should waste time of the students and students are not focused on their studies and they should take responsibilities of both the studies and job but this is not possible for a student.

Part time job effect the student study and health and they are really in need for money and fulfill their needs they help their parents and. . . . . . .

And the Part-time job is training independence and changing spending habit. My parents make me do Part-time job. It's true my home doesn't have much money for raise children. That moment the part-time job annoying me but that moment my parents don't care about my spending. So I changed my habit of spend and I learned independence. The part-time job is important to our future as that reasons. So we have to do a lot of type part-time job in young age.",A2
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in this country, well I think smoking should not be completely banned in every single restaurants in this country. Because believe it or not I think more than 50 % (percents) of peoples (former residence) in this country still need some spaces for smoking. When smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants it will reduce their customers. It is better if all the restaurants still make some special room for smoking area for their customers. It will be good for the smokers, and also not seriously harmed for people around them (smokers). With this every customers that still need to smoke can do their activity, and customers that no need to smoke( not smoking one) can do their activity without feeling disturb for the customers that smoke in that restaurants. But as my experience, in other country that have growth so well in their economic in the world, Our neighbor, Singapore. We, smokers ( I am also a smokers !) do not have some or much space for our activity, smoking. In every single high and fabulous (magnificent) buildings that they have in their country, even flat for living, shopping centre, their giant hypermarket they do not provide smoking area in their buildings. We must go outside the buildings to do our activity. We are not allowed to smoke there, smoking seriously harmed. They also fine people that breaking that rules 1. 000 SGD.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned in restaurants not only for the health of other people, but also for the atmosphere. Many people think that smoking is an exciting way to rest them. Some people think smoking can make them be a handsome person, especially the young. But some people smoking just because their friends' influence. They smoke everywhere, not caring other people. As we all know, smoking can hurt our health, both body and mind. If a person is sitting with a smoking person, he will be more dangerous than the smoker. Restaurants are public places, many people get together here, talking, singing, eating and doing other things. They will be very happy without any pollution. However, if a person is smoking, they may be dangerous because of smelling the smoke, and they cannot eat quite well for they cannot smell the smoking. They may be not able to eat anything, and then they would go. Thus, smoking may broke a harmony atmosphere. In a word, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants; it hurt the smoker as well as others. For the purpose of protecting the health of people, especially the people in public places, smoking should be banned.",B1
"Working part time is doing at free time. I think that students should do this work because it can make us experience. Furthermore I can help my parent while they toil every day. Although I would do this work, I know learning the most important. I should take time out right. Some people must not do this work, they will not have freedom. However, I am not change their idea. In addition to doing work I can give for time with reading. In doing this work, it can make me parent when they tried for me. But learning I should not quite so. Although I can do in pairs together. I should look after health my own, so should not heavy work. Student must have duty to learn and consequently good effective. But doing part time which everyone can use knowledge of their own and apply into work. In addition to applying can help me for learning in class or not teacher.

"Even though smoking has been a historical part of many cultures worldwide for many years, it is time for change. Long gone are the days when smoking should be seen as fashionable or cute because it no longer is, if it ever was at all. The medical evidence that has been gathered over the years has shown clearly that there is nothing cute about dying from smoking and I have never seen anyone with emphysema who looked fashionable to me. The jury has long been in on this one folks, it's time to cease and desist. There is nothing good that can be said about smoking at all, but we hear an awful lot of bad stuff. I am sure that if many of us were to think long and hard, we might recall somebody that we knew who had cancer, heart stroke or some other disease which they contracted from smoking and I don't believe that if we picture that person before their death or illness, that we would say that they looked fashionable or cute either. The tobacco companies continue to get richer while the people continue to get sicker. Time for a change and the time is now.",C2
"In this time, many college students already have a job. Actually it is an part time job. Part time job is a Job that have a reduced work time almost half from the normal work time. And the salary its not as much as salary of the full worker job. The salary of the part time worker is about from Rp500. 000(about fifty dollars) to Rp 2. 000. 000, 00 (about two hundred dollars). It can exceed two hundred dollars depends on what part time job do you take and how many hours the job or how difficult the work. I say it was important, because college students can get more experience before he feel the reality world of the business world. College students can feel how hard it takes to make some money, so he become more mature naturally. Part time work can increase students skill ( if the part time job he takes is the same with his major). It can train a skill of managing time from the student. If he take a part time job, the student must arrange his or her part time schedule with his college schedule. So, it will train the college student discipline. That's why I believe part time job is important for college student.",B1
"As an undergraduate student, I strongly agree that it is Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, smoking in inner place will impact someone who hates the smell of smoke. Smoker may pronounce that it is their right to smoke; however, it would ruin other people's right. Second, as everyone knows, smoking will damage your health. Second-hand smoke will be even more harmful. You may not care about your own body and think that it is nothing, I just want to do what I want, but I think it is just show your unrespect to your body. Of course, your free to do thing like that, nevertheless, you can not bother other person who does not want to be like you. Taking me for example, I am afraid of the deceases which caused by the second-hand smoke like cancers and tumors. Males' sperm would become ill and females would become sterile. That's just horrible. Third, a burning cigarette may cause serious disaster. For example, many fire accidents were caused by the cigarettes which was not be put off completely. Many restaurants are decorated by very beautiful carpet and cloth which are tend to catching on fire. In short, I firmly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1

"Our times are very expensive school fees. Either starting from kindergarten, elementary, junior high school or university. School fees at the present layer. Almost inaccessible by all around us, particularly communities that class society. On one side for some people who are able to send their children not fully utilized by the children themselves. Sometimes they go to school in a perfunctory, the lazy do not know how hard their parents pay for school. So it is recommended by some parties how your students how to bring these children or how hard it is to make money as the cost of their education. Their trick is to find part time job outside school hours. It is expected that way. They will from realize how difficult to find money and establish how the world their characters work actually it. With a part time job they can recognize early what the working world was like before. They will from entering the real working world after they graduate. So they will get necessary experience. They learn practice from outside school. Students who part time job also learn to be independent people. With the money they earn, they may have their own pocket money and they can pay the school fee with their own money. I recommend taking part time job while studying at college.",B1
"I disagree to a certain extent. At this age, studying is more important than having a part-time job. Working is a life-long process but studying is not. Students should make full use of this golden opportunity to focus on their studies and achieve good grades for their future. This may enable them to apply for scholarships to further studies or work in reputable companies. They may be able to earn more and buy the things that they desire to compensate for their hard work over the years. When students have a part-time job, they may get distracted from their studies as they want to focus on earning more money to buy the things that they desire. This may cause them to neglect their studies and their grades may be affected badly which will be reflected on their transcripts. Upon graduation, they may not be able to enroll in good schools for further studies or work in good companies. However, some students may need to have a part-time job as their families are unable to provide for their school fees. They may work as long as their studies are not affected. For example, I had to work part-time during my polytechnic days as my parents were unable to afford my school fees. I ensured that the part-time job would not affect my studies. I would only work on the weekends during school days but I would work almost every day during semester holidays. I quitted my part-time job eventually as my studies were affected. ",B1
"I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Unlike high school student, college student must learn and study more voluntarily and hard. Also, they have to learn about real society and go outside. To do so, a part-time job is one of the most reasonable means. In fact, almost all of them think about their future, for example, job, their own family, and death, more seriously. I have spent every day alone since I entered the college, and I'm poorer than the life of hometown. I have a part-time job so that I can live by oneself. As you know when you work, there are a lot of things which we should learn. For instance, we are supposed to learn the way of communicating the others and to have responsibilities than ever and so on. My friend, Takeru, lives alone and makes living by oneself. In spite of this life style, he has very grate record and belongs to tennis club. I respect him so much as my good friend, and also, he gives nice advices that will be surely useful in my future. By reason of these, I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job.",B1
"Wherever you go, you may certainly find people smoking especially at restaurants. Smoking has become a wide spread phenomenon. Men, women and even children have the habit of smoking. We don't have the right to stop them from smoking, but the law can decide where they can smoke and where they can't. So as an aspect, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking can release one's stress indeed, but its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. It is harmful to our body especially the lung, the smoke smokers release also does harm to nonsmokers. Restaurants are public places where people have meals, the environment must be clear, smoking in the restaurants not only pollute the environment but also pollute the food, what's more, smoke can spread freely in the restaurant, that's to say, all the customers in the restaurant will suffer the awful gas, so the quality of environment cannot be assured, let alone enjoying the meal. Hence, banning smoking in restaurants is a wise act and we must conduct it as soon as possible not only to make the dining environment more comfortable but also to make us more harmony and healthier. Only do like that can we enjoy our meals in the restaurant delightedly.",B1
"As a college student, we have more time which we can totally handle on our own than before. It is maybe the first time they live without their parent and have the own power of their own life. Some may want to get a part-time job to earn more money for luxury items or something else they want. To my perspective, it is great to get more life experience through the job. What's more. If students have their career experience when they are still young, they will be more skillful for the future time. And they will know how hard it is to earn life; it will be time to appreciate what they get from their parents. To the perspective of a corporation, they will get a more mature staff compared to who do not have any work experience. People who love work and strive during the working time will be fine. But for students, learning is what they should put on the first priority. If they just work all the time and abandon their study, it is like put the cart before the horse. No enterprise will hire a college student who did not finish his education. Students can only have a part-time job when they have free time.",B1
"I am the smoker. Therefore, recently I was many worried about the implemented antismoking policy stops. For example, as to the nonsmoking section and no smoking building setting, there is no consideration about the smoker. This gives the inconvenience to the smokers. Of course, the cigarette smoke gives the very bad effect to the nonsmokers. However, the smokers moreover, it smokes with the maximum manner. If the place where it is designated is prepared, it can smoke in that place. Therefore, the preparation about the severe smoking or the nonsmoking section setting has to be once again thought. The equal rights are included to the smokers. Therefore, the right of the non-smoker and smoker has to be equally thought. And the consideration which moreover there are lots of the non-smokers has to be given. The smoking is one part among the freedom of the people. In the country, the consideration about the smoker has to be given. If not, in the dimension of state, the smoking is not produced. In this way, if it becomes, if the country classifies the smoking into the narcotic and illegally the smoking is made, it will be of service to the country profit. It will have a good effect that it is good in the people's health.",B1

"The university students are becoming better and better in finding ways to enrich their campus life. Apart from joining sports teams and student societies, having a part-time job is certainly among the top choices. The importance of part time job is recognized by a great number of people, me included. Most students go to university to prepare themselves to blend into the society in the future. Being successful in the society calls for skills of working and cooperating, which can be developed from part time jobs. For instance, one can learn how to set the working agenda and get help from colleagues. Without these skills, even if the student gets a good occupation upon his graduation, he/she will possibly feel it difficult to get used to the job, and thus his/her performance will not be satisfactory. Another advantage of having a part time job is that it offers some money, which the student can use to make their life more colorful. Such advantage is embodied by the experience of my friend Bill. He likes travel very much but he lack the money to do it often. However, that limitation is eliminated by the part time job he found. With his salary, he managed to travel to many places such as Singapore and Tokyo. Of course the salary can also be used to purchase a piano or football according to the interest of students. In conclusion, having a part time job brings a large number of benefits. Though it might be a bit difficult to find a satisfactory one, the outcome of the part time jobs is worth all the effort.",B2
"The experience gained from a part-time job is priceless. My first job was being a waitress at my parent's friend's restaurant. I thought being a waitress was to just be friendly and take orders and then the customers would leave you a generous tip for writing down their order so well. I had a positive outlook and attitude on my first day at work; however, things did not go as I had hoped for. First, I did not make myself clear enough to the cook when I asked him not to add garlic to a customer's dish. He mistakenly thought I said to add extra garlic to the dish and the customer was obviously not happy. Then, I spilled a cup of soda on a customer's blouse. To make things worse, one of the restaurant's most loyal customers demanded to speak with my manager because she accused me of spitting in her drink. Just from this one day of working, I learned that being a waitress meant much more than taking orders. You must live by the ""customers are always right"" motto and good communication is a must. I obviously was not a waitress for very long. My next job was a cashier at a supermarket. The ability to communicate well with patrons here was a very vital part of my job.

"I agree that college students should have a part-time job. When you study in college, you have to spend a lot of your money. You have to pay many things every day. For Thai student, you get money from your father, mother. You haven't earned money by yourself. It's a good idea to have a part-time job for reduce duty of your parents. When you have earned your money by yourself, you will proud. And you will know when your parents have to work-hard for earn a lot of money. You will know how much they tried.

Spending your free time in this way can make a lot of useful. Someone doing a part-time job in the supermarket as a cashier, in the coffee shop as a waiter or waitress. You can do anything that it's not illegal and it does can make you earn some money. I think you can find an experience. You can learn how to work, how to keep your money and will find yourself what you love to. In future you can find a job that suit for you. Then, college student should have a part-time job.",B1
"Imagine that you are having a romantic dinner with your spouse, at a restaurant with nice ambience and the tempting aroma of food, when all of a sudden you smell a whiff of pungent cigarette smoke from the table next to you. Will that affect your enjoyment of your dinner? For me, it most definitely will, and thus I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants, for two main reasons. Firstly, second-hand cigarette smoke has been found to be extremely harmful, even more harmful to innocent passers-by than the smokers themselves. This means that smokers are actually bringing harm upon others when the smoke they exhale gets inhaled by the people around them. Will you want to enter a restaurant where you cannot breathe without inhaling all the poisonous fumes from other patrons' smoking? Most likely not, and therefore for the sake of their customers, restaurants should prohibit smoking within their premises. Secondly, smoking does not fit in well with the ambience that restaurants aim to provide their patrons. What we associate with smoking is the image of a slightly unkempt person in shorts and slippers and horrible-smelling breath, in other words, highly unappealing. On the other hand, restaurants are portrayed as high-class with delicious food. Thus, for the sake of their business, smoking should be banned so as to preserve their image. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants as it will benefit both the restaurant and the patrons ",B2
"I think the university during the period. We should try to work time. But. Achievement is very important. So. We should be appropriate to do part-time jobs. Should be based on academic oriented. When you find part-time work will affect your Studies. They should concentrate on their studies. After all. Student work is to study and graduate. Part-time work is very important. But not the most important then study. If will not affect my academic performance. I think I will try to do part-time job. It is good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. After-school work enhances a young person's social development. After-school work teaches students how hard it is to earn money and helps develop thriftiness in our younger generation. Because they earn money, students can pay for their education and thus will value their education even more. And, in return, their experience will make them know better what they have learned in classes and books. Part-time work allows us to learn many things. But do not spend too much time on part-time work. I believe. When we graduated from university. Part-time work is clearly very small salary. But we learned some life experience before.

"I agree with the statement above regarding the prohibition of smoking in public places like restaurants because it would be very annoying person who is around smoker are what hope do we already know and understand the dangers of what will be caused by smoking, although we do not smoke if you breathe in smoke from cigarettes we are indirectly become passive smokers and to be affected the same with active smokers so that that ban smoking in all public places is very good. From the research I did turned out to smoke a cigarette can spoil the taste of these foods, because before we eat food we can assess the taste of food with a delicious smell which increases appetite, can we imagine if that delicious smell is mixed with the smell of the other will cause people to be reluctant to eat at a place that made rules that prohibit visitors smoke inside the restaurant so indirectly the owner of the restaurant to give comfort to the visitors. But in reality are no longer effective way because a lot of visitors who still smoke inside the restaurant was probably due to the lack of socialization to the visitors about the ban, perhaps because it is now a lot of restaurants that create a special place for smokers to smoke more active in order not interfere with the visitor which is in the restaurant.",B1
"In today's world, it has been debated whether Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants or not. Some restaurants regulate smoking for many reasons. Other restaurants just separate smoking zone from non-smoking zone. I disagree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for 2 reasons. One of my reasons is that people have to have freedom. And it depends on country as to what they violate. People over 19 can buy cigaretts anywhere, so they have right to smoke anywhere. Of cousrse, I am non-smoker. However, my father who somke cigaretts often told me that cigaretts helped him lower his stress level. Likewise, some of them feel relax when they smoke. So we don't have any right for them not to smoke. So it should be legal to smoke anywhere, of course, under the restriction that you have to be over 19. Second, there is a best way not to infringe the rights of each other. The way is that restaurants separate smoking zone from non-smoking zone and give right to do something. I think it is generally agreed that an individual's rights extend so far as they do not infringe the rights of another. To summarize, smoking at restaurants should be legal to reserve right to do and people should have the right to smoke.",B2
"I think there are many important things for college students. Therefore, having a part-time job can be one of them, but it should not be the most important thing. The most important thing for college student is to study and examine their own field. The reason why they major in the subject is to study more in the subject they are interested in and to find a job that is related to their fields of study. If they need working experience, they can do internship during summer or winter breaks. Since most part-time jobs are serving in restaurants, or working in factories, they are not closely related to their fields of study even though it brings students good experience. Also, the reason for getting a part-time job is for earning some money. However, it is better to study hard and get a scholarship. Then, students can compensate the time of doing their part-time jobs. Students can have many experiences from other activities besides part-time job. For example, students travel around the country or abroad in order to broaden their perspectives. Or they can join some school clubs in order to learn and build up social relationship. Also, they can do volunteer work to help the poor or the physically-challenged. As I said above, there are many things to do for earning money or getting more experience except for part-time job. I did not mean that there is no need to do part-time job. I mean we can invest our time more reasonably doing many kinds of activities or focusing more on study depending on our purpose. Therefore, I believe that there are many more important things than doing part-time job.",B2
"Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants because smoking indoors affects everyone inside the building, both smokers and non-smokers. Dividing dining rooms into smoking and non-smoking areas does not provide a true shelter from the smoke for non-smokers, nor does designating times when smoking is not allowed, but allowing smoking during other times. The smoke lingers in the air throughout the restaurant and creates an unpleasant odor that certainly affects the customers' dining experience. Restaurateurs should be concerned about this because fragrance is a large part of enjoying food, and having cigarette smoke mixed into the air will have negative effects on non-smokers, who did nothing to add that smoke to the atmosphere in the restaurant. Non-smokers who do not want to be around smoke while they are eating will find a different place to eat given the choice, or may even decline invitations to restaurants where smoking is allowed, which represents a loss of business for restaurateurs. A physical disadvantage to allowing smoking inside of a restaurant is that wallpaper yellows and needs to be replaced more often due to exposure to smoke over time. Add to that the possible loss of business due to non-smokers choosing other restaurants, and it starts to make financial sense to ban smoking inside restaurants. Japan features some restaurants with smoking areas or rooms fully enclosed by walls or glass with special fans sucking the smoky air out of the room, and these seem to work well toward keeping smoke away from the rest of the restaurant. If installing these smoking rooms is cost-effective, there could be a way to allow smoking inside of restaurants, but it may be the only way if non-smokers exercise their right to decide and take their business elsewhere.",C2
"When I was a small child, I felt curious about why my father like smoking so much. I still remember that my father told me that the cigarettes are to them what the snacks are to us. Sometimes our lives need this kind of eating things to have entertainment. According to this, I hold the opinion that we can't ban the smoking in the restaurant. Indeed, smoking in public sometimes will disturb others and make the air dirty; the restaurant can avoid this by preparing non-smoking area for people to have a cigarette. By doing this, it can easily solve this problem. Although, may some people would say there's no benefit to smoke but harm people's health. Living in a sociable society, you need to know the basic behaviors of how to communicate with others in business or something else. The cigarettes as a tool contribute more on the process. Of course it's hard to avoid having cigarettes in a restaurant. Finally I also want to emphasis that people should smoke in a suitable way. After all health is the most important thing in your life. Not smoke too much for the sake of your health. I am not appreciating the opinion that we should ban the smoking in the restaurant. Instead, I would prefer having a smoking area.",B1
"As with my last response, I feel that it is much easier to rely on numbers than it is to make qualitative arguments that have no real basis. I have to admit that I am not as well educated on the subject of smoking and I have not recently read any news about the subject, but I would venture to say that an overwhelming majority of people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants. That's it. No more discussion. We live in a democratic society, and I am not sure if Japan as a democratic society as well, but if the majority of people there think smoking should be banned in restaurants too, then they should just do it. By living in a democratic society, we have agreed to support the idea that the majority rules. One thing that makes this difficult, however, is that most democratic societies also put a strong emphasis on freedom of speech and action. No one should be persecuted for their beliefs or for their actions, and so in some ways it is difficult to approach this object in a completely satisfactory way.

"I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. As I said before, I am very conscientious about my health and my fitness, and smoking has absolutely no place in my life because of its power to destroy the body. Another thing that many people don't know about is the ability of smoking to destroy the mind. Smokers can become very nervous and fidgety if they do not have their nicotine, and I think this makes them weaker as people. If the only time they can be very cool and collected is when they are smoking a cigarette, they have an enormous disadvantage as compared to people like me who consistently work to become naturally more focused and energetic. Japan has always struck me as a country where the people are very Zen, and so I would think that they're not particularly keen on tobacco use. But at the end of the day I don't really know. Therefore, if the Japanese people would like to be like me and would like to become more conscientious and better to their health, they should ban smoking at the restaurants in order to achieve this goal. If they can do that, they will take a step towards being more healthy as a country.",C2
"I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Or if the kids can give the parents the money that is earned by them, their parents will be very happy.

"The issue of banning smoking has been argued in this decade, and this has been in the hot seat recently. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, as the cigarette contains different kinds of harmful substances shown in many discoveries and some of the substances may cause tumors and lead to death. The cigarette also contains some chemicals, making users addict to it. Air pollution may arise in addition to smoking. Some people may be annoyed by the smoke that being breathed out, especially at indoor area, in which the area is less ventilated. However, some may argue it should not be banned at all restaurants, for example, the restaurant managers, since it may affect the flow of customers, including smokers. As they may argue that some of the customers may choose not to go. Also, there are some difficulties in defining the area of the restaurants if the laws are made, such as the sitting area outside the restaurant and the outdoor catering area, and another problems may arise in related to the penalty of violate the laws. In conclusion, I support with the idea of banning smoking at all restaurants, but there are still some unsolved aspects have to be tackled in order to be in the regulations.",B1
"Smoking is generally deemed to be a social vice by many. The issue of whether smoking should be made illegal in food establishments is debatable. While the majority --- non-smokers --- would welcome this move due to its benefits of reducing air pollution and lowering health-related problems, smokers would frown upon this decision as it would cause severe inconveniences to them. This essay shall attempt to illustrate that while smoking should be banned at restaurants, the management should take into consideration the plight of smokers and allocate a designated spot for them to take a puff. Smoking should be banned at restaurants as it would provide a cleaner environment for patrons. The absence of smoke in the air would greatly reduce the amount of pollution in the area, providing fresh air for customers. This would allow the majority of the customers, who are non-smokers, to enjoy the ambience. Furthermore, the reduction of smoke particles in the atmosphere would reduce the risks of one contracting second-hand-smoking related diseases. Hence, banning of smoking reaps many benefits that supports the decision. Nonetheless, in doing so, smokers would be sapped of the freedom to smoke before, during or after a meal. This inconvenience may propel them to avoid eating as such establishments. Such a move would result in a loss of profits on the part of restaurant owners, affecting the economic well-being of Singapore's food and beverage sector. Amidst the slow growth, a blow in the food and beverage sector could be detriment to the Singapore economy. In conclusion, while the health benefits accrued to banning of smoking is enticing, one must not neglect the financial drawbacks of such a decision. 275 words ",B1
"There are more and more people having smoking habits, because it's a way to release pressure. But there are more reports that figuring that disadvantages due to smoking. People may struggle in everyday life, but it is also important to find right way to relax. To the person who smokes, he may say"" it's part of my life, I have to smoke to release pressure and keeping going on"". Otherwise, to those people who do not smoke, he may complain that there is all smoking smells all around. As now, governments has claimed some rules to protect those who smokes and doesn't. Smoking although can make someone feel relax, but it has some bad effects to human. Like smoking could cause cancer, especially lung cancer. And it will lead to cardiovascular disease, letting life spam getter shorter. Reports also reveals that women who always in a secondhand smoke environment, it will be much more high risks to get breast cancer. We should respect every other peoples' choices, but we should remember not to effect other persons. Recently, we could find some entertainers reveals bad images after smoking, it is valuable to remind us to reflect ourselves. When smoking, we should learn to control ourselves to do it.",B1
"Smoking is a bad habit. I never like the cigarettes and smokers as well. The smoke of the cigarettes causes cancer of lungs along with other disease. Its so dangerous for health as drinking rather according to my point of view it's even more dangerous than a snake because even a snakman know that snake is dangerous but a smoker never thinks that cigarettes is dangerous he/she just love it. We should avoid to sit in the company of the smokers because it's smoke effect the nearby person more than the smoker. The reason is that the smoker inhale the smoke that is filtered while the persons in his/her company inhale un-filtered smoke that is more dangerous for health. In Pakistan it is law that cigarettes should not be sold to the persons who are under eighteen but unfortunately it is disobeyed. There is no one monitoring the sale of cigarette even if a policeman see someone smoking who is under eighteen, he never takes any action. Some people adopt this habit in the childhood when they see someone of their elders smoking while some people start smoking when they are young as a fashion or style but after sometime they become chain smokers. Some people start smoking when they are in tension because generally smokers say that cigarette releases the tension. We should aware the people from the drawbacks of smoking. We should not hate smoker but we should hate smoking.",B1
"Being a non-smoker, the natural stand would tend to deviate towards a complete ban of smoking. However, a significant proportion of our country's taxes are derived from the tobacco industry. Banning only bring about revenue loss and generates unhappiness within the affected population. Smoking should be not entirely banned at all the restaurants in Singapore, lest the smoking corner. An isolated room could be allocated to provide smokers with an alternative, besides, smokers tend to show less concern with inhaling second-hand smoke as they are doing it concurrently while smoking. We achieve both objectives of creating a smoke-free environment for the health-conscious and a bother-free environment for the smokers. The basis behind the suggestion is to induce social-awkwardness within the smokers, quitting must start from within. While it may seem like an unfriendly proposal, we must realize that these smokers possess the ability to control their habit and stand align being considerate in a social manner. Non-smokers have to bite the bullet and tolerate their smoker friends and counterparts. We do not ban smoking completely in lieu of preventing social unrest, but we strive to create a more considerate society. An entire ban would also result inconvenience for the smokers, they are limited to few eateries and this creates a double-edged sword situation. Restaurants will lose business, which is undesirable, a majority of Malays are smokers, picking up smoking from young. Muslim restaurants will fold up in a matter of months, smokers would be forced to take-away their food and soon be irked by this practice. While banning smoking is beneficial for the general health in Singapore, social unrest stemming from a single race could result in conflicts due to multi-racial unhappiness. Quitting is from within, not condemning. ",B2
"I agree with the idea it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have 3 reasons for it. First, college students often need money. Many students live alone near the college and need money for living alone. If a student's family is rich, he may be helped by his family for all money he needs. However, most students are not in such situation, so they should have a part-time job. Second, college students should experience many things in college days. College students should study hard, but they have much time they can use freely. So, they use such time for not only studying but also part-time job. Working will teach them many important things, relationships with people in places they work and the difficulty of earning money for themselves. Third, college students will come to use money well by earning and using money for themselves. College students should learn not only study of college but also how to use money well because college students are just students but they are adults in point of view of their age. So, I agree the idea it is important for college students to have a part-time job by this 3 reasons.",B1
"Some people hold the view that smoking should be forbidden in public places. However others stand on the opposite side, thinking it's much to strict. As far as I am concerned, I support the former. The reasons are as follows. First and foremost, it is commonly acknowledged that smoking do great damage to smokers' health and even make smokers have lung cancers. Since there is no good to smoke, why do people smoke and even can be allowed to smoke in public places? Besides, when a person smoke in public places, people around him, including infants and the old, have to breathe the smoke air given off by the cigarette. In some public places which are indoor and only have limited space, such as libraries and restaurants, the damage smoking do must be greater because the polluted air stay inside instead of going out. Last but not least, cigarette butts and thick smoke may probably lead to a big fire, destroying public facilities, such as buildings, parks, libraries, theatres and so on. From all these reasons raised, we can come to the conclusion that smoking should be banned in public places, not only for ourselves and people around us but also for public safety.",B1
"I think have a part time job is very important for college students to help in completing our daily needs and college's administration, more jobs we can get as private teacher, shop assistant, and etc. Because, to have a part time job can make us become independent. A part time job, it can help us to spend spare time, because the lecture does not always full time. Sometimes there is also a lecturer who was unable to attend, so we have a lot of free time that many if not used properly. But we must pay attention to our health. We still have to learn from the work concerned. But more than time is free, until we should be clever content time free by a part time job. But more people disagree about its important for college students to have a part time job, because it can disturb study for college student. Some people have an opinion about its important for college students to have a part time job, because we can get the money not science. That study is more important that a job, because we needs awake healthy, but opinion for college students because time is busy. It's well that free time. It's depends us to repair our time to make it balance between work and study.",B1
"As everyone knows, cigarette is not perfect goods for people's health. However, many people smoke in a few places, for example bars or restaurant, where they will have an effective communication. I do think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The most important reason is that it does make other people ill because they are breathing it in and smoking can deeply damage people's health even if they don't smoke. Firstly, smoking is the main reason for cancers. The more people smoke the shorter the can live. It could say smoking is the chief criminal of goods which will kill people. Secondly, it is also damage people who don't smoke. Restaurants are public place where full of people who don't smoke such as children and the old. If someone smokes at the restaurant, it actually changes the atmosphere of those places. No doubt smoking is very danger to our body, and especially it is more harmful to them who don't smoke but breathing smoke in. In a condition it is a must to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in China for us and our next generation.",B1
"Agree, because there will be additional revenue. And leisure interests as well as the three-car experience to use in the future. We plan on time. With an adult. To what would have to buy it.

Better use of leisure time to travel. To play games that are not beneficial to the society and we have more unemployment and social problems, I am a part time job that is necessary for students to even make the time to learn. Less leisure, but we need to plan. The time is not so bad about learning to know their time is just this happy with a part time job.

"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I would term a part-time job to include flexible casual event based jobs as well as regular weekly paid activities. The two main benefits of having a part-time job is earning money and learning life skills. I believe that having a part-time job would help a student to be more independent, as he would not depend completely on his parents for allowance money. He would also learn to better appreciate the value of money and how one must put in effort to earn a living. With a part-time job, the student will also learn about responsibility and management of time and activities. He will need to learn to prioritize his time and be diligent in his school work in order to keep up his grades while holding on to a job. However, though it is important and recommended for a college student to have a part-time job for the moulding of character, it is not an absolute must for every student to do so, especially if he is unable to manage both school and his part-time job. In this case he would be biting more off than he can chew and the end result would be disastrous, with the student achieving mediocre results in both aspects of his life. Ultimately a college student must fulfill the basic requirement of completing college. In sum, having a part-time job would be encouraged if circumstances allow, as it would offer a holistic environment for the student to learn life skills that will help him transition better into an adult working life. The student however should be competent enough to juggle both activities and place school as a priority. ",B2
"Smoking is bad at body and it can happen cancer after. Smoking in a restaurant or a road can be suffered damage to other people. Then, Smoking is banned in public places and the restaurant must make smoking seats. Smoking does not care alone. But if smoking someone give damages to other people, it is wrong. I think smoking is a preference. But I think giving up smoking is very good for one's self and other people. If someone can't give up smoking, he (or she) must not give damage to around people. And I think that reason to do not giving up smoking fall into hypnosis. For example, they have smoking, and then they study or concentrate better before they have not smoking. And I think they are cured mental treatment than we say them simply ""You must give up smoking because it is bad at body"". However everyone who smokes doesn't fall into hypnosis. So Except for this people who fall into hypnosis, we must respect people who smoke in 21st century. To do so, we should extend smoking areas. And people who smoke must not give damage someone who does not smoke. Because of this reason, I allow smoking if people who smoke do not give damage to other people",B1
"Nowadays, it is gradually accepted that smoking is a bad habit. Consequently, more and more countries have set laws to ban smoking in public places. As far as I'm concerned, that is terrific for us. Smoking is a bad habit, since it is bad for not only smokers, but people around them as well. It is unfair for them to suffer from smoking, for they don't do anything wrong but have a risk on their health. As the Bible says, everyone is born equal. Therefore, for the sake of non-smokers, our government should ban smoking. Laws should protect the benefit of the most people and show the equality of human society. Smoking is supposed to be forbidden in public places. On the other hand, smoking, itself, is a nuisance for our human society. It is thought to be a big cause of cancer as well as other diseases. Both the smokers and the second-hand smokers have a high risk on gaining the No. 1 killer---cancer. For instance, in a family, father is a smoker while his wife and his children are second-hand smokers. Study showed that about one-third of the cancer is related to smoking. Government ought to discourage people not to smoke. In addition, smoking do harm to our environment because it releases many kinds of harmful gas when lighted and tobacco agriculture is bad for our earth. In one word, smoking is nothing good but a sudden joy to the smoker when smoking. Smoking in public places should be banned. Let's say 'smoking free' to our society.",B1
"I agree with having a part-time job. Because working is precious experience and the thing that we should have responsibility for. So we can get much useful time in it. But I disagree with having it only for getting money. Because we should study in free time. So we should work to study. For example, if one wants to be a teacher, he should work at a juku to learn to teach children useful knowledge. And if one wants to be a sports trainer, he should work at gym to study useful knowledge about sports, health, and so on and to learn communicate with many people. In the other words, it is important for us to work at the place where there is the thing that we are interested in. So it is stupid thing to have a part-time job only for getting money. And when we work only for money, we waste so much time. We should have it in our minds that we have limited time. It has only four years. But if we use it usefully, four years is long, long time. So I agree with having a part-time job only if we have it for studying many precious things.",A2
"Imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy your meal because of the smoke coming from the table of others. Banning smoking in public places should be completely done by the government. Banning smoking in public places isn't just a question of taking away one group's freedom for the benefit of another; it is something that is in the interest of people as a whole. It comes down to a decision between the health of a whole nation versus the freedom of a minority. Arguably by allowing smoking in public places it is the freedom of non-smokers that is being restricted because second hand smoking is more dangerous. Second hand smoking increases the risk of heart attack and heart disease. The only effective way to avoid the effects of second hand smoke is to insist on a smoke-free environment. In response to it smoker's and non-smoker's choice shows that everyone is being affected by smoking being banned in public places like restaurants. During the course of the meal a cloud of smoke is now no longer a bother. Because there are now designated areas for smokers and non-smokers someone could enjoy a meal without being uncomfortable. At the same time, a smoker is made uncomfortable because the restaurant is a non-smoking facility. Only the non-smoker can be completely satisfied. Is that fair in a free nation? If public places would compromise and designate certain areas for smoking and non-smoking then maybe everyone could be in a public area and be comfortable or satisfied.",B1
"Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. I am agree with this statement. We know in the cigarette there is many addictive material which one can made many diseases for our body. Smoking in public area not only danger for our smoker but also many people around them. Beside that, can make our lungs has many hole. Smoking is a tradition not only for Indonesian's people but also people in the world. I don't know why they have a bad daily activity like that. It is a government's homework about how to handling smokers to smoking in special area. If you smoking in public area it like you kill people around you. Because cigarette can make many disease and make a pollution. If you smoke in the restaurant, can make all of food can be contamination. Beside that, cigarette is a biggest donate for our country. If smoking should be banned, so this country has less income. If a cigarette factory is closed, society around that haven't a job. The cigarette factory must make some activity with our society for save our earth, for example plant the tree, clean up the garbage in the river and the sea, etc. So, the cigarette factory not only produce the cigarette but also save the earth. So smoking in the restaurant should be banned, the owner of the restaurant make a special area for all of smoker. So, at now smoker must stop smoking can be spent your money to benefit thing and make the air free pollution. So far as we know, now is global warming, we must save the earth from pollution. Because we know that if the earth has broken cause pollution, etc.",B1
"The damage of smoking cigarette have been confirmed over half century. Smoking cigarette causes the diseases including the lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease. The passive smoking, someone breath other's tobacco fume in public area even he or she does not smoking, is another risk that has negative influence on people's health; furthermore, the passive smoking's damage on pregnant and children is more harmful than on normal adult. Thus, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people claim that the restaurants should build an area that allows smoking. In my opinion, I against this idea since it will cause two side effects. First, the smoking area leads to the air pollution among the whole restaurant. The Department of Health (DOH) sets a serious regulation of smoking area in order to avoid passive smoking, but rare restaurants reach this standard because of the equipments and high cost. Next, the children will imitate smoking as a result of adult's behavior that smoking in the restaurant. Once the children imitate this wrong behavior, it would be difficult to remove the addict of smoking and to decrease the amount of smokers. All in all, the smoking brings a lot of disadvantages, thus, I agree that smoking should be completely forbidden at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"It is widely acknowledged that smoking does much harm for human's health and it should be completely banned at all especially at all the restaurants, which may not only benefit the person himself, but also do good for the people around. Like most of the other public places, restaurants are always crowded where different kinds of people stay together. They have meals, talk freely and at the same time have a lot of fun. However, it is often occurred that someone lit up a cigarette who may just be accustomed to this kind of relax but really bothers the others. People who don't smoking will feel very uncomfortable and unsatisfied, and people who smoke will tend to have a cigarette too which would make most of the other people around more unpleasant and not want to have meals any more. What's worse, those smokers obviously show bad manners, leave a bad impression and largely ruin their personal image. On the other hand, it is accepted that smoking does more harm to the people around than the very person who smokes. So the smoker really should be condemned as he sacrifices others' health for his own bad habits. OK, now imagine that you walk into a restaurant where there is so much smoke floating in the air that one can hardly breathe, would you want to sit down or even have a meal? Of course you won't. Therefore, for the sake of the fame of the restaurant and the health of all people, smoking should be completely banned. And as long as all of us put it into action, then the meals may taste more delicious.",B1
"Smoking at public places seems to be a prevalent problem in the country nowadays. It might be relaxing for some people but they could be irritating for some. Well, I join the latter's side. In any angle, smoking is dangerous to the health of everyone. Though it may keep you stress-free for some time, it will surely poison you little by little, gradually. Plus, a cigarette stick contains substances that are considered toxic. For instance, it contains DDT, a main component of pesticide. We're humans and not pesticides, aren't we? More to that, it contains a substance called nicotine, the main reason why smokers get addicted to it. Now, the question arises. Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? If my opinion would be asked, my answer would be a big YES. My argument is that smoking releases toxic particulates that are not visible to the naked eye. These particulates will be suspended in the air. In time, these would settle and the food eaten by customers would be affected. Also, second-hand smokers are more vulnerable to the ill effects of smoking. This is why some patients suffering from lung cancer or emphysema seem to be alarmed with how they got the disease when they themselves never even smoked. I have a firm stand in this issue. After all, smoking in public places is already prohibited. It's just that it is human nature to oppose authority.",B1
"Smoking, I think it is best to stop smoking. Smoking is bad for your health. If you continue to smoke, you always die from the effect of smoking. Smoking always cause lung disease, even cancer. Therefore, you should not start smoking. I try my best to avoid any smoking activity around me. It is because I hate the smell of smoking. I try to stop all smokers to smoke. However, many people argue that they can decide to smoke fewer. They feel that they can control themselves to not smoke more. I don't think so. You can easily find that it is difficult for smoker to smoke fewer. Stop smoking can protect the health of you and your family members who may breathe your smoke. You should know that your family membles are more easily causing lung disease when you are smoking. In my point of view, all smokers should stop smoke to protect your family members and frields. Smokers can use nicotine replacement products to help them stop smoking. There are several kinds of nicotine replacement products. They are small and convenient. Therefore, all smokers should use the nicotine replacement to start a health life and protect their lovers.",B1
"I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons. First, it is painful for people who don't smoke to have dinner in the restaurant. They often get worse when people are smoking. Some people say, We don't have to ban smoking in the restaurants. It is enough to make the non smoking seats. It may be better than there are not non smoking seats, but we can't say it is enough. Because smoke really can go everywhere in the restaurants, so people who don't smoke finally get smoke. The managers in restaurants should be more careful for their guests to enjoy having the dinner. Second, smoking made the restaurants dirty. I have a part-time job in Japanese restaurant and guests can smoke everywhere in the restaurant. After the guests go back home, I clean up the room. Then, I always find that there are a lot of ashes on the tatami. It is really hard to clean. And I also find the color of walls is getting yellow a little. I can't believe there are people who don't hesitate to make the room dirty. They are guests, but it is natural to be should keep the manners.",B1
"Just as an old saying goes, one coin has two sides, part-time job can bring us some convenient, money, expand our social experience, but can also waste our time, scatter our concentration, and may eventually influence our grades in the university. For me, I think the bad influence of part-time job overweighs more than the advantages, and it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job wastes our academic and free time. University is a place to study the latest knowledge, try to get involved in many fields, such as some other course besides our own major. However, part-time job would take up most of the time; and if we cannot use the time in our university more efficiently, we would lose the time to improve ourselves both physically and emotionally. There are some other ways to make money and fulfill our social experience, except for part-time job. For the students in great need of money to get through the university, part-time job isn't the only method. We can ask for some fund and scholars from our school, also we can be a TA. So we can use some academic ways to make money. Besides, internship is a better way to get social experience. Also, part-time job would scatter our focus on the campus life. For example, if we get a part-time job as a tutor for high school students, we must have to prepare the classes, get to the classroom or the students' house. And all the things will bother us and break the peaceful campus life. To sum up, part-time job isn't important and necessary for college students. What we have done in our university will decide the way of our whole life, and obviously we should make better use of the period.",B2
"Not now, not ever. has been antidrug campaign's slogan, but I think it is also suitable for encourage people not to smoking. The Hong Kong government has implemented a policy in order to ban smokers smoke in some restaurants area, but I do think that it is not enough, the policy should apply to all restaurant area. If we improve this policy, this will absolutely encourage more smokers to give up smoking, because they are hardly find a place to smoke, or else they take the risk to pay the punishing payment. Many researches show that smoking badly affect our health. Tar can increase mucus in our trachea, so smokers may always coughing. Also, nicotine will increase the chance of developing a lung cancer. And second-smoke can badly affect a child physical development. So why don't the government do more to encourage the residents not to smoke? Some people may said that we are deducing the human rights of the smokers, but think deeper, do the smokers also deducing our human rights? We do not want to breathe I any smoke that is produced by cigarette, and introducing this policy is for the smokers' health good. We should do more to encourage smokers to get rid of smoking, and let the restaurant be more hygiene!",B1
"I agree with the statement to a certain extent, but I will focus on the analyzing the benefits. It could be said that the job of a student is too study, and he should work hard at it. Yet, this job is one that comes with no salary and furthermore is a job that one usually pays to do. Thus, especially with college students who pay high school fees, many students do indeed take up a part time job to earn their way through college or for some pocket money. There are indeed certain benefits in doing so. For example, the working student would experience first-hand the working conditions of whatever job he is in, and perhaps have a clearer understanding of work. This is in comparison to the naive student who enters the workforce without prior work experience; he passed through his college education without a good understanding of the next stage of his life. Having a part time job, out of necessity or not, could be seen as a complement to a scholarly education. Friends I know have said that once you start work, you would understand the freedom you have while in college. On the other hand it seems that most college students cannot wait to start work. Working and studying at the same time would allow you to compare these 2 activities and allow one to come to a more mature understanding of his purposes in these activities. This I feel is a benefit of primary importance. ",B2
"Interval, gradual, healthy way of life, change of brand fruit, mouth wash. By smoking we usually mean smoking of tobacco. There are many people who are addicted to the smoking of opium and other intoxicating drugs. People use various kinds of apparatus for tobacco-smoking such as hookah, pipes, cigars, cigarettes and cheroots. Tobacco was first brought from America to Europe Early one day in 1492, Columbus's shipmates saw the people of island (now known as Cuba) smoking bundles of rolled leaves. They copied this habit and became smoking. Later on Sir Walter Raleigh introduced tobacco and smoking in Europe. Hookah-smoking was known to Eastern Kings. The Physicians used it as a cure for stomach-troubles. Now smoking is one of the most popular habits. Even women have caught up this habit. The new issue of no smoking in restaurants is a very controversial topic that people feel is unfair and unconstitutional. People believe it is unconstitutional because it is against the constitution to tell people what they can and cannot do. I agree with this law because with cigarettes particularly, the most harm is done to the non-smoker, an innocent bystander. In restaurants these bystanders are usually the employees. Employees that don't smoke don't have the choice to sit in the non-smoking section, they must work in the entire restaurant and subject themselves to second-hand smoke which is more harmful than actually smoking.",B1
"I agree, but only in the sense that it would really be good for those who have had no real job or work experience before and to get one before they graduate and of course it is a must for the students that need an extra financial resource. On a reality check level, it's a good thing and might also serve to knock the chip off the shoulders of one or two students who could do with a good dose of attitude correctional therapy. For the students that must have a job, it goes without saying that they usually have a better mental approach to working and college. They are more thorough with their work and studies and certainly better organised than most of the others. Partly because they have to be, and partly because they have a clearer understanding of what they need to do and have solid schedule in place to keep them on track. A part-time job can be a blessing or a curse, depending upon each student's emotional maturity levels, outcomes, purpose and actions. Quite often the only difference between those who combine work and college successfully and those who don't is mind set. If the get that part right then students are well on their way and quite likely to achieve their goals.",C2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. There must be different opinions over whether permitting the teenagers to work as a part time or not. Some people may claim that students' main job is to study and they are going to work in the future anyway. On the other hand, others will refute this claim by saying there are a lot things that students can learn working outside of school. Personally, I believe working in the teen age is beneficial for the following reasons. Working outside will provides opportunities to know one's interest to the youth. It is significant to know what one likes to do and is excellent at during teenage years because then, the student can make a choice of his major based on his interest when applying to universities and thus, what he will learn through college years will be helpful directly in his future career. In Korea, a number of people often get to work in a field which is totally different from one's specialized area. This is mainly due to the fact that college students realize their major studies are not really fit for their interest and what they want to learn for their jobs. This relatively late realization leads students to change their major in their junior or senior years and it enlargers their schooling spending more time and tuition. The worse case is that some people miss the time to change their field of study, gradate colleges, and try to find jobs that are nothing to do with their past studies.",B1
"I agree this statement. I have three reasons. First, Cigarette is a kind of drug for smoker. It includes Nicotine and this has poison. If you smoke 40, 50 cigarettes every day for 20, 30 years, you will probably become diseases of lung. So not-smoker should not smoke and smoker should stop smoking as early as they can. In this point of view, this opinion will be useful for smoker to start to stop smoking and to send a healthy life. Second, Smoking is not healthy for surrounding person too. This is because the smoke which smoker blow out has strong poison. A restaurant is the place where a lot of people are, and some smoker comes there with his family. So smokers should not smoke there for the others and their family in order not to bless the smoke. Certainly, there is an argument that separating smoker and not-smoker solves this problem, but it is almost impossible to separate them completely. People who are around border can be made to keep blessing the smoke. Finally, because recently people who understand an effect of cigarette and stop smoking are increasing, this idea is not ideal. It may be achieved sooner than you expect.",B1
"Part time job is definitely one of the most meaningful practice during one's university life. We can gain actual working experience and, for the first time in our life, earn some money by working. Different from the so-called social practice we performed in our middle school, part time job in university give us an access to actual practice. It's a precious opportunity of actually involving in real life operations, but still having some supervisors to keep us on the right track at the same time. Also, due to the relatively higher speciality, it actually enable us to have a sense of how things will work in our future career and find our whether this domain is suitable for us. By trying all kinds of part time jobs, we can find out what kind of profession are we looking for. Also, earning money with knowledge we learn is a great inspiration. It can bring us a sense of satisfaction and promote our enthusiasm of perfecting our professional skill. Money thus become more meaningful to us. It can help us to grow what a certain amount of money represents if we are earning it by working. This will definitely help us learn how to manage our money more appropriately.",B1
"I strongly agree with a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants throughout Japan. There are four reasons for this. Firstly, smoking is bad for health. It is now commonly accepted throughout the world that smoking is bad for health. Smoking is not only extremely detrimental to the health of the actual smoker, but more importantly it is now generally agreed that the effects of passive smoking are equally damaging. A meal in a good restaurant should be a leisurely experience, and can often last for two or three hours. Non-smokers dining in restaurants or bars should not have to endure the effects of breathing other people's smoke for long periods. In addition, staff at restaurants work long hours, sometimes in very enclosed spaces. Being able to work in a healthy environment is a basic right. Secondly, children should not be unnecessarily exposed to the bad habits of adults. Children are a regular sight at popular restaurants throughout Japan, especially on weekends. Tobacco is not only unhealthy, but it is also an age-restricted product. Having smokers sitting at the next table sends the wrong signal to children. Thirdly, smoking affects the taste of one's food. One of the pleasures of dining out is experiencing tastes and smells of foods that one might not otherwise eat. When we'taste' food, we are experiencing a combination of sensory signals from both the mouth and nose. The smell of cigarette smoke can change the taste of some foods. Many restaurant managers worry that banning smoking will affect business, however statistics from cities in Europe and the US reveal that there has been no significant loss of business since a blanket ban on smoking was introduced. For these reasons, I fully support a ban on smoking in restaurants.",C2
" Nowadays, more and more university students start to do a part-time job. Should we do a part-time job in our university life? People have a discussion about this phenomenon. Is it important for university students to do a part-time job? In my opinion, this point is right, because doing a part-time job has some benefits. First, I think in the university we learned things which is just about our profession. So it is very narrow. We should learn other knowledge from doing a part-time job. Second, they can get some cash, they can not ask to their parents for money. This way can solve some economical problems. Thirdly, in a survey about what can you describe about you university life? 60% students said they did not know what should they do, they had many time but they did nothing once. They wasted a lot of time. So they could do a part-time job so that they can level up the experience. We are in great times, then we must do something in order to become a real person in the society. Besides, in our future life we can know about the advantages. So it is a good choose to do a part-time job.",B1
"I think that part-time job is important for college students, and for the following reason. First, by working with many other people, we can acquaint ourselves with them. Making many friends is very important in our lives. Second, we experience new environment that we have not known, so we can learn many important things. For example a social rules such as a greeting, responsibility, and attitude. They are essential for college students to go out into the public society. But it is very difficult to learn social rules. We may mistake many time at part-time job. We may be got angry. Through these bitter experiences, we surely become adult. So I think we need some mistakes at the part-time job. In public society, it is too late for us to make a mistake. Part-time job is first step to go into the society. Third, we can earn money on our own. I think most of college students work because of this third reason not first or second reason. College students have much free time. Using their time for them is efficient. For these reasons, I think part-time job is necessary, so I agree with that college students do part-time job.",B1
"Youth of today, the need to try something new. The producers have used up several drugs and increasing more and more. How many sdrugs have, such eat, smell, smoking, and squirt. Smoking is frequently. Value is false in categories adolescents. They thought that smart, cool, show, flourish but they wrong. In fact, it is repulsive. Are many factors that cause is smoking. For example, made be a friend or friends invited, family problem, strain, and other. Smoking is dangerous to people nearby and yourself. Causing many diseases such as cancer the most common. Many people die because of smoking. Troubleshooting such as parent should have time to talk to more children and good advice, Invite your friends to turn to sports, provide knowledge about the danger of smoking to children, the government should be more strictly. I have acquaintarces that he died from smoking. He pump consecutive time. Many times a day pack. When the body is rarely enough to weaken. Have many side effect. He does not plan to stop pain are heavy but late. He died in the end. I think we can stop and walk when we know which way we should be to move forward. Except we do not choost it. Finally, I would like to leave ideas for children. Think before you do anything for family because what happens follows is lost. Smoking is to blame both themselves and those around it. Therefore, attention should be people near you.",B1
"Everybody hope to have a good healthy and have your life for long times. They would like to keep fit and strong your body such as the exercise, eating are vegetables or low sugar of food, some people control the meal of food and drinking pure water, milk and do not eating drinking anchohol or smoking. In the restaurant supporting to ""No smoking"". And there set the spare area must not smoking. As the same time the smoking killed many people around the world. Because it has cancer. (it's very dangerous of life). Anywhere are anti of the smoking in the School, College, University, Temple, hospital, Bus terminal, Department Store and Toilet etc. Many people to say yes! And banned smoking at all the restaurant and anywhere. They want to have a good healthy and good air. Althought, today's many teen-age boy want to smoking and they think is the old man, it's misunderstand for a long time. The workers are smoking, then they are serious from work and they want to relax time, it's good feeling. Finally, I agree with the content, because smoking is not good and bad healthy. We could set the area for a smoking for someone to do it. And balance the area to relax for everybody have good asmosphere more than support them. And then we have a pure air, good healthy and good place for enjoy activities with your family.",B1
"I think that it is important for us to have a part time job. College fee has been very high recently in the case of national college. It is not to say in the case of private college. If students live alone, in addition to this fee, they need to pay a house rent and food cost and so on. And if brothers or sisters of students enter colleges, their parents are imposed on heavy burden. So we should help our parents in the part of financial. We learn the human relationships from having a part time job. Particularly relationships with senior people are very precious. If we do not have a part time job, we do not have an opportunity to communicate with, for example, ten senior people. Communication with senior people is essential for us because when we get a job two year later, most of people are senior to us. And we learn a right way of speaking by serving customers. We learn the hardship to get money. In these reasons part time job is profitable experience for us as a preparation of entering adult society. In the view of earning money and cultivating humanity part time job is important.",B1
"I agree with this statement, and I actually do a part-time job after my classes. I think it necessary to do a part-time job. First, we learn many things in working. I think that the part-time job is a chance of learning to fit into society. College students will become a member of society in the near future, so it is very important for us to learn the society. The most important thing I have learned is that many kinds of people live in the world and I have to broaden my outlook. Besides, college student is a grown-up, though he studies in university. So we have to take care of ourselves little by little. When I began to do a part-time job, I know for the first time the difficulty of earning my living. And I realized how much I owe my parents. Moreover, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. We have a lot of time to spare in our school days. So we often want to enjoy traveling with our friends. We also want to enjoy our hobby. In either case, we need a lot of money. So we have to keep on working to earn more. Therefore, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"Some college students think part-time job is important for them but some people do not think so, they think good education is more important than part-time job, make they think college students shouldn't do part-time job.. But some college students come from poor family they think they have to do part-time job. Personally, I think part-time job has advantage of it, makes college students have responsible, makes they know it not easy to make money, makes they meet many new friends and makes they have ability to planning they life. Part-time job is a good way for good leaner students; I mean they will have a free time. But I think college students shouldn't do part-time job because I think college students should learn hardly for their future. Today, if you have low grade you will get badly job. But I don't say that you have no part-time job, do it a little from you free time, take more time with your lesson and do high grade. If you get high grade your life will be better. Today many college students and many high school students have part-time job. They spend many times to make money, and then use it nonsense. It makes their time useless but it better than they use their time with bad thing.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Right now, what is being done at some restaurants is having a non-smoking zone and a smoking zone at separate parts of the restaurant. However, smoke travels, which defeats the purpose of having the separation in the first place. Eventually, smoke would still be smelt at the non-smoking zone. It can be argued that the smoke would still be much less than what it would be if there was no separation between the two zones. Nonetheless, being someone who really dislikes cigarette smoke, smelling it in the air when I clearly am sitting in the non-smoking area actually greatly affects my mood. Therefore, I think that restaurants should either completely ban smoking or if it doesn't have a way to ensure that the separation between the two zones is effective, allow it altogether. That being said, it might not be economically feasible to have restaurants that allow smoking without having the two zones, because it would totally be a turn off to non-smokers. These restaurants' customer base would be greatly limited to smokers and non-smokers who do not mind the smell of cigarette smoke and the adverse effects it has on one's health. Hence, I think that all restaurants should just ban smoking. One might say that this complete ban would bring inconvenience to smokers and this can be seen as a form of discrimination. I beg to differ, though. Smokers can always go outside of the restaurants for a smoke before or after meals. In addition, smoking brings with it a negative externality; it brings harm to third-parties who breathe in the second-hand smoke. It is an act that should not be encouraged; in fact, it should be discouraged. In conclusion, I feel that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. ",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I am smoking by three year. But I never smoke in restaurant. It is very rude behavior that smoking in restaurant. I don't stand for rude behavior. I'd like to express why don't ban smoking in restaurant. First. I'd like eat food in clear environment. Are we both thinking the same thing? If that is the case, we ought to ban smoking in restaurant. When I was young, I hate to smoking person in restaurant. My family is same thing Father is be outspoken in criticizing to them. I am helped my father behavior. Second, smoke is very harmful in healthy. But the cigarette smoke is giving other people more than harm. If they were smoke in restaurant. They are compensating for damage. I know that smoking is hard to endure but other people don't want scent your cigarette smoke. If you have a think you endure to smoke in restaurant. Finally, if you smoking in restaurant, I could smell the cigarette smoke in my clothes. Are you dry my cloth? In conclude we must have forbid to smoking in restaurant. That is, the only way to keep a people relationship. If someone smoke in restaurant, the police a levy a large fine to him. We are considerate of others feelings",A2
"I don't think so. There are many smokers in Japan. They smoke to relieve stresses and people go to restaurant to eat meal and to relax. In fact, when I go to a cafe, there are often some office workers resting and smoking. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, they can't relieve stresses there, and in addition, they may feel unsatisfied. It is nonsense. There are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats in most restaurants to let nonsmokers and smokers more comfortable. In that case, restaurants should keep the air completely clean for fear of not being complained about smoke by nonsmokers. If smoking is banned at all the restaurants for the purpose of making smokers stop smoking, it seems to be better to ban selling cigarette. There will be little change even if smoking is banned only at the restaurant. Exactly, people may be able to eat meal deliciously by doing that. But smokers go to other place to smoke. For example, they smoke on the street, and people have a trouble of their throwing away cigarette butts. Such a thing will repeat. I think that the most important thing is decreasing the number of smokers gradually rather than keeping out them from restaurants.",B1

"With social development, smoking forbidden takes more and more important place in building the civil society. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is bad for health, and smoking in restaurants put bad effect to other people. Also, we need to build a more harmony society. First, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is harmful to our body, especially while smoking in a restaurant. As we all know, cigrette equals poisson. But we can't ban cigrettes, for the contribution to the economy given by the cigrette company. So what we can do is to stop smoking in restaurants to protect people from second-hand smoke. Second, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant may annoy other people. From my perspective, smoke in public is rude, for smoking is a kind of private behavior, and many people hate the smell of smoke. So smoking in a restaurant may let people feel unhappy. Last, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because we need a more harmony society. According to what has been mentioned above, smoking makes other people feel uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is against what we are seekingâ€”a harmony society. In that case, to get a better image, to build the civil society, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, due to smoking in restaurants is harmful to our body, our mental and our society development.",A2
"I agree with this statement. There are some reasons as ground for my opinion. One reason is that college students who have part-time job can experience 'working adult'. In the future, almost all the college students must work in society, and display their ability with all their strength, have responsibility for what they do all. But, in this state of conditions, if there isn't any opportunity for making preparation to enter the society, they will be less likely to adapt themselves to society. So, having part-time job is need. By doing this, they can develop themselves for their future. Second reason is that by having part-time job, college student can money for their own purpose some freely. Before they have part-time job, they accept money from their parents. Of course, It is said that they independent from their parents. And so, when they use money for their own purpose and pleasure, there is limitation in amount of money for use and they usually feel guilty. So having part-time job is need. By doing this, they come close to the state of self-support, and get the chance of controlling a use of money by themselves. Last reason is that by doing this, they can become acquainted with other people newly. To encounter other people bring us much profit. Person who they meet in part time job is sometimes important friend throughout their life. Getting this chance is very essential and delightful. Considering these ideas, I agree this statement.",B1
"It seems that every college student wants a part-time job nowadays, which I think is not necessary. No one can deny the fact that doing a part-time job makes you nearer to the real world. Without having their parents to depend on for advice and guidence, fresh men need to improve their abilities of living and deciding things by themselves. At the same time, gaining some work experiences and sharpening their skills before graduating can be help in this competitive society. Also, popular as the conceptâ€”â€”part-time job is, more and more students believe that the traditional kind of college lifeâ€”â€” sitting in classrooms studying all day is just out of date. They tend to go out, seeking a chance to get an cool job. After all, making money on their own sounds extremely exerciting. However, at the negtive concern, problem arises that different from some developed countries, (where students commonly take part-time jobs and from where the word part-time job came)the money part-time jobs can provide in China is so little that almost no one can actually live on it and keep setting aside an appropriate amount of time for learning as well. So money is not the key of its popularity. For many of us, a part-time job may only add 10% to our pocket money. Another hidden problem may be serious. As part-time jobs apell millions of college students, some people manage to use their passion and make traps to get them in. They often pretend to offer you an good job, talk you in and persuade you pay all kinds of procedure charge. My roommate was beguiled of 1000 yuan last term without hesitation! The part-time job market is far from safe for we college students. From where I stand, part-time job can provide some help for poor students and improve abilities in some degree, but is never necessary for everybody.",B1
"I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job, but I think it is important for some college students whose bursary is not enough. For someone who want to have a lot of experience of doing jobs I think it is good idea to have a part-time job because it get both experience and money, but it is not good idea to so serious with part-time that it effects studying. If whatever reason make you have part-time jobs, the important thing that you should remind yourself is My present main job is studying and you should divide your time properly. You should select the part-time jobs that don't make you more tire. The part-time jobs that you select should be in your free time and your time must transcend for studying outside class. Moreover, it is good if you get a part-time job that is compatible with your major. For me it is not important to have a part-time job. Because I think that the most important thing that I must pay most of my attention now is studying and I should my best with my studying to get a great job in the future. In term of experience, college let students have a period to practice the job when the students are in year 4 of studying. I will get the experience when I reach that time.",B1
"Smoking is a bad habit. And unfortunately this is also becoming a habit of our society. The number of smokers especially in Pakistan is increasing day by day. And it is an alarming situation for every one of us. The youth of our country is one of its highest. It is injurious for our health. Smoking has very adverse effect on our health. Many people join the smoke additive people become of their bad company. When they become inhabitant of smoke they gradually turn into a drug additive person which ruins the whole society. He cares for nothing and lives in the world of fanatics. Restaurant is a public place where many people come for enjoy themselves and to eat delicious food. They come with their families look for finding a good environment there. Now days we often see that many people in restaurants are smokers. They are smoking there and are polluting the environment. They are disturbing the other people contently sitting in the nice place for pleasure. The just behave friendly towards the other people. Therefore smoking should be banned in restaurant because it is not only bad for the health of the smokers but also for the other people sitting at that place. The reason is that the stander of that restaurant would become low. And nobody would like to go such places where smokers are sitting and polluting the environment. In this way the economy of restaurant will decrease day by day. Families would not be able to come in restaurant for the sake of pleasure. Hence, the after effect of smoking is very disastrous whether it is done on road or in restaurants. And it should be banned in restaurants and at other places. Because without leaving this habit our country can't progress.",B1
"I agree. I realize that a lot of people will disagree with me, but I feel that students who have part-time jobs usually work better with their degree studies. Perhaps it is because they are normally more organized than some of their mates or they have just gotten into sound routines when it comes to balancing work with study. Some just couldn't be bothered working anyway, because they just want to cruise through their degrees and have parties every day. Nothing wrong with that, if they pass, but I think the ones that I have seen who are also working, seem to take their studies more seriously and dread the thought that they might even fail one subject. I am not saying that this is true for all students, it is just my opinion based on the comparisons that I have made between different categories of students who I happen to know personally. Another thing that struck me was that there course averages seemed to be slightly higher not for any one particular subject but generally speaking over the course of their degrees. I also think that for a lot of students these days, they understand what is happening in the world, the economy, the job market and they know that if the want to get anywhere in life, they are going to have to work for it.",C2
"I agree with the opinion, but I want to change the words in Japan to in the world. And I have three reasons why I choose this. First, by smoking, we can not find the taste of food well, so if someone smoke in the restaurant, other people around him can not find the taste of food well. So if we appreciate the fact that we can eat food, we should not smoke in the restaurant. Second, smoking is bad for health, so if someone smoke in the restaurant, other people around him are made bad impact from him. Especially, smoke which other people take in is worse than smoke which person who smoke directly take in, and people who take in smoke which is from smoking person is likely to be lung cancer. So people who smoke should stop to smoke before other people say to you I wish you stop to smoke. Third, in the place where many people gather, there may be a person who do not like cigarette, so people who smoke should stop to smoke to make a good mood. Consequently, I agree with this opinion. But I say again, the words in Japan should change to in the world.",A2
"In some countries, people are no longer allowed to smoke in many public places and office buildings. While some countries are having a discussion smoking should also be banned in restaurants or not. In my opinion, if smoking is not allowed in the restaurant then it is quite good rule. There are some reasons to express what will support my ideas. They are as follows: smoking is not good for health. If a person who has the habit of smoking then he or she can have breathing, lungs and heart problems. The smoke of cigarette is also very harmful for health. If people smoke in public places then it is not only injurious for the smoker but also for others who do not smoke. For a healthy life, smoking is not good. The smoke of cigarette has toxic metals like Cadmium. If human body contains excess of cadmium then it creates many health problems like bone and heart diseases. But smoking in the restaurant will cause both the smokers and surrounding people facing with those problems more than public places. Because most restaurants have more narrow areas and less air flows than public places. The people in the restaurant will be able to get more toxic metals than the people who are outside the building. The restaurants have no fresh air inside the premises and there are many who do not smoke, but they are forced to inhale the smoke let out by smokers, so nonsmokers can suffer from nausea due to lack of fresh air. As the result, for the safety of humans it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurant as well as in public places and office building.",B1
"Recently, the students who combine studying and working are increasing. I think this case is going bad. First of all, student's part-time job prevent them to concentrate on their study. Of course I understand, getting a part-time job is not only reason to disturb study but, it is one of obstacles for study witout no doubt. To illustrate my poin of view, When I was in college, I have some friends who had a part-time job after school. They almost worked 4-5 hours a day and easily get exhausted. As a result, they didn't get enough time to study or to do homework and even they had to choose sleep during class-time to supplment lack of sleep. As I mentioned above, teenage students's part-time job has negative effect on their acdemic achievement. In addition, college students can esaily be extorted by employers because they are too young to know a lot about the world yet. I am aware that there are many kind employers but still some adult let young people overwork. They only provide minimum wage for students that sometimes even low than regulation. And instead, they ask students work hard watching closely whether they get lazy or not. Taking all those things into accounts, college students should not have a part-time jobs that hinder them to achieve academic goal and squeezed by bad employers. There is old saying in Korea, ""The most beautiful person is who is engaged in what they should be. "" I do not have the slightest objection to this word and it is about time that students should realize what really important in their school days.",B2
"People come in the restaurants for amusement and enjoyment. They come for heaving healthy food in a healthy envoirment. Smoking is a serious issue of time nowadays. Its smoke is very dangerous and harmful for our health. Tjis smoke which contains many anti health chemicals and are responsible for lung's cancer and other disorders related to breathing system. So, it shows that it is very unhealthy activity. In restaurant, there should be healthy atmosphere. All should be clean and pure. So that people come there again and again for having comfort and enjoyment and a healthy bread and butter. But smoking is really injurious to health. It smoke not only effect the person who is having a ciggerate but also to the person who is sitting near to him. This smoke mined in air and air becomes polluted. When the people sitting in the restaurant are breathing they take in that polluted air and as a result their lungs are contaminated with this harmful smoke. This is what smoking is giving, nothing but only cancer and other infection. So, I agree that smoking should be strictly banned in restaurants so, that health of people can maintained and their life can be secured.",B1
"It is not necessary. I think the part time job interferes with school hours and not do anything serious in both could cause both the poor should be. The bad grades came out and did not fully work. The work will make us too tired and do not have time to read books. Now our mission is intended for students to have good grades can have a good job and secure. If we do both simultaneously. We may lose the opportunity to good work at the future. It will cause negative effects in the long run when we graduated. However, if families have financial problems, we should be able to raise funds to help with that or loans for education. In the future, if we have to do a good job, we will be able to take care of our parents. But if we do not have a stable job, it will not be able to feed them our best when they get old and may be a burden on them. So I think that there is no need for the part time job during being student. What should we do now is commitment to a stable course for the future. It would be beneficial over the long term and should make us more successful in life.",B1
"Did you ever see No smoking in this area or Smoking is prohibited here? As many of you know smoking is bad for your health also secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. So many people designate non-smoking area and They disadvantage for smoker. But smoker's right important than non-smoker's right. They will say, ""I'm the one who smokes. Mind your own business! Cigarette is an item of personal preference and the government collects taxes from smoker. In spite of that many other countries are also striving to decrease the number of smokers and have developed a variety of anti-smoking policies. Where smoker is's right? Are they criminal? I think that the government has agreed to lift restrictions on smoker and they're Induce smoker to decide to stop smoking. So restaurants divide the area in to two sections. One section is non - smoking area, the other section is smoking area then they're not going to complain to the government about this. Also smokers should try to keep a non-smoker's right. Then the government doesn't collect taxes and developed a variety of anti-smoking policies. And In this way, there will be less people smoking and it is possible that this dispute might disappear.",B1
"I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurant in Japan. Most people in Japan have known the serious harm of smoking, such as cancer of the lungs, but in fact there are many smokers in Japan. Of course smoking is no good for our body, but for heavy smokers, I think that life without cigarettes is nothing other than pain. If smoking was banned at all the restaurant in Japan, smokers would be under great stress, because many people go to restaurants not only to eat dishes but also to take rest. Smokers' rest means having a cigarettes. I do not smoke. And I feel irritated when I'm in a secret room and other person in the room start to smoke. But even so, it's not right to take smokers' rights away. I think it is desirable to make smoking area and non smoking area more strictly at every restaurant. There are already smoking room at restaurants, but it is not enough. Smoking area and non smoking area should be separated more reliably. By doing so, smokers and non smokers will be able to go to restaurant without any reservations.",B1
"Nowadays, many students have a part-time job. They do the part-time jobs not because they can't afford the tuition or their living expenses but they want more money so that they can buy more luxurious things they want. I don't much agree to have a part-time job. There are three following consequences if they have a part-time job. First, for college students, take our major for example, we have lots of projects to do. Accidentally, for some subjects, even if we don't have so much homework to do, we need lots of practice to understand. So if we have part-time job, we can't pay attention on the works and studying. Basically, it's easy to get bad grades and fail the subjects as well. Second, making friends is important. In order to maintain a good relationship with friends, we have to spend time with them. However, if we work too much, our friends may leave us away. The last, there are many clubs and campaigns in college. Attend clubs and campaigns, we can learn many things as well as make more friends. For those who spend much time on part-time job, they can't participate in these activities. To enjoy the life in college and learn more things you can't learn after leaving the college, and if you have enough money, just don't spend too much time on working. We will have more time to work after we graduate isn't it?",B1
"Restaurants are public places for common people to coming and enjoy themselves. Peoples are coming here and take dinner, lunch. But any where smoking is a bad thing. It is very dangerous for health.

Restaurants are public place every one is come here most of the people are smoker. The smoke of the cigarette is dangerous and came most of the diseases.

It's smell is very bad and peoples are hated this who don't use the cigarette. It is necessary to reduce the smoking in restaurant,. Because it is a public place and every one is come here most of the people are not liked the smoking. So it is the duty of Government. Government should be based on smoking in the restaurant. Smoking should be banned on restaurants peoples are fully enjoys here with families.",B1
"I agree with this statement. Smoking in restaurants will definitely have an effect on the environment of that restaurant. This in turn can affect the restaurant's customer satisfaction, especially families with kids or non-smokers. This is because second-hand smoke can also be detrimental to health. Moreover, most coffee shops and bus-stops in Singapore already banned smoking. This is to discourage smoking and also to help prevent non-smokers from coming into contact with second-hand smoke. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, it would help to achieve this aim even further. On the other hand, by banning smoking at all restaurants in the country may result in restaurants losing customers who smoke as they now would not have the freedom to smoke in the compound and may turn to coffee shops, that allow smoking, to dine instead. Currently in Singapore, there are an increasing proportion of non-smokers relative to smokers thus the focus should be put on non-smokers. Although banning smoking in restaurants will make them lose their smoking customers, this policy would be able to attract non-smokers, which is a larger number in Singapore, to dine at restaurants. Banning smoking would do more good than harm as smoking causes more harm to the human body in the long term than the temporary mental enjoyment during smoking. Therefore in conclusion, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. ",B1
"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job. There are several reasons. First, college students need some money, for example having lunch or eating dinner with friends. Although studying is the most important thing for college students, having a good time with friends is also important. Students enjoy playing with their friends everyday. Second, a part-time job brings up college students. By working, college students learn social skill, manner, and common sense. A few years later, all the students will be required such things. College students must practice by working as part-time worker. Third, a part-time job is the important chance to make friends. In fact, my coworkers and I are good friends. Talking with the seniors is very interesting. I enjoy part-time job with them. Fourth, college students should know the importance of the money. No man wastes the money that he earns. To learn the use of the money is very important. Thus, I think that college students should have a part-time job. A part-time job needs a lot of time, but that is never futile. There are some people who don't have a part-time job. If they start working, they surely grow up in various aspects.",B1
"I cannot agree more that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country for two major reasons. For the first, smokers do not have any right to disturb non-smoking people while having a meal. Once people smoke in a space, the smell prevails in the space for a long time no matter how much effort is made to remove it. The smell and smoke can reduce other people's appetite and make them feel bad while eating. It is proved that eating something in a bad mood can cause health problems. Even though smoking and non-smoking areas are separated, there is likely to be the smell of cigarette since it leaks while the door is being opened or closed. Secondly, smoking not only pollutes the air in the restaurant, but also can make the place unhygienic. Food and ingredients can absorb the smell and smoke, which is definitely not good for both taste and hygiene. Besides, ash is generated while smoking and often moves in the air. As the ash is not easy to see since it is small particles, people might not recognize the ash falls on their food. Consequently, they may come to eat the ash with the food. How horrible! Therefore, smoking should be prohibited at all cost in every restaurant.",B1
Smoking is one of the curse of the societies. Like other evils none of the countries of the world is save from smoking. It is becoming a sign of fashion. But some of the illiterate people in their bad companies used to smoke just to pass their time and talking through the nights. Youth has adopted smoking just as a fun. Education places are providing best conditions to do so as there is no check and balance. However smoking should be avoided in public places like restaurants. Smoking is very dangerous for one's health. Its smoke also effects people breathing smoker's smoke. Restaurant are dinning places and should not be used for such purposes. People along with their families in restaurant find difficulities in their visit. It should be banned for teenagers. The sale of cigarretes should be restricted. Media can play an important role in prohabitation of smoking. Gaurdians and parents should keep an eye on their children that they may not fall in the curse of smoking. Seminars should be conducted for public awareness. Those who had fallen in hell of smoking should be convinced and awared to leave it. advertisement of smoking materials should not be so attracted that unawared immature youth got attracted towards such bad and injrous habit.,B1
" In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public places. No mattter what reason you may possess, no matter how willing you are for smoking at that moment you are in the public place, as a result, you can not smoking there. On one hand, smoking in public places is an unmoral behaviour. As we all know, there are usually many people in public places. And I suppose there are lots of people hate somebody who smokes in public places, not only for the places not belong to his or her only, but also for the healthy environment. The smoking activies actully seriously injure the smokers' organs especially for that lung, says the statistics from the WHO, there is more than one third people died in lung cancer simply caused by that smoking. Not only the people who smokes suffer this disease, but also the people who breathe the bad air--the smoke, will face the danger of catching the lung disease. What is more, the smoke coming from the cigarettes is bad for the environment. And it is linked to the greenhouse effect to some degree. We all need a better place to live in, so forbidding smoking in public places is a way of protecting our environment. In the end, I still say that smoking absolutely should be banned in public places without doubt, not only for the smokers' health, but the publics', and to be more, for a more confortable life, a cleaner sky, an enjoyable air. a more beautiful earth.",B1
"I agree that it is important. Students quite often think that everything should just be given to them on a sliver platter. Especially the ones that do not have to pay for tuition because it is being paid for by their parents. Having a part-time job would teach them that they have to do some work to get paid and that when they enter a company, their company expects them to do good work and perform their jobs correctly in order to keep their jobs. This would teach them some kind of work ethic and to have some responsibility. They would soon come to understand that they have to do this consistently and therefore, have some discipline and pride in the work that they do. If they don't do a good job, they will get fired and that is just the way it is. Having a part-time job while they are still at college will get them started on the right track towards keeping a full-time job when they get their degrees. If they get fired while they are still at college then it won't be as bad as getting fired from a full-time job and they can learn from the experience, continue their studies and move on.",C2
" As a college student, we should not only study hard but also enhance ourselves in kinds of aspects and widen our horizons. We can take part in all kinds of activities in the college. We also should take a part-time job to practice ourselves. It is known to everyone that we pay all our attention on study when we were in high school. Because at that time a high grade is the only purpose. Now the situation is different, only learning knowledge in books is not enough for us. We will step into the society after we graduate. so we must have practice skills. Taking a part-time job is a good way to practice us. It not only makes some money for our tuition but also enrich our college life. What's more, it is also a good experience for us to learn to communicate with others, which is important for the future work. In conclude, taking a part-time job is very important for college students'. We college students should take advantage of our free time to learn something which we cannot learn in books in order to become a useful person for society not a book warm. Taking a part-time job is a ladder for us to work in the future.",B1
" There is an ongoing debate concerning around the issue as whether it is important for college students to have a part-time post. As a newcomer in college, I think that working out during vocation is an admirable experience for us, for the following two reasons. First of foremost, students in university have a great amount of spare time, some students will drop themselves into internet bar to spend their time after study. Of course, it is insignificant to waste our valuable time in this way. So, though work, we can be prevented from addicting to computer games and we won't feel boring in spare time. Secondly, for the young generation like us, doing part-time job means we can get working experience and reward. We can slowly become financial independent and ask less money from parents. We should know that time in university is so short; every one of us will finally get in society. It is obviously that we are laying foundation for our future through working part-timely. Nevertheless, part-time isn't always perfect. We must admit that as a young adult, we are easy to be cheated. So it is commonly reported by newspaper that university students were cheated when working out. There is still some risk exists. So, we should learn to protect ourselves when working out of school. It is also a skill we can't learn in our textbooks. On balance, I tend to believe it is significant for college student to do part-time job.",B1
"Having a part-time job is important for university students. There are mainly three reasons. Students can obtain experience from having a part-time job. Most students need to work after they have graduated, and it will not be easy to work if they haven't had a job before since they have no experience. Having a part-time job is a straight-forward way for students to get some working experience. Most employers prefer students with working experience because these students can get used to the job faster. Having some part-time job experience will give students bonus when they are applying for a job. Students having a part-time job will treasure what they get from their parents. Before having a job, it is too abstract for students to understand that earning money is not easy. If a student has a job, he will know that working is not relaxing and he needs to work hard to earn money. Then he will know that his parents are not easy to earn a living and thus he will treasure what he gets from the parents. Students can earn money from part-time job. University students are adults, so they should no longer spend their parents' money. Having a part-time job is a way for them to earn what they need and they can release the heavy burden on their parents. From the above reasons, it is important for university students to have a part-time job.",B1
"I feel that having a part-time job for college students can have both its benefits and disadvantages. For example, having a part-time job trains the student to manage his or her time well, as well as to prioritise his or her duties. The student can also learn how to multi-task, a skill which can be advantageous when he or she starts to work. In addition, the part-time job may be relevant to the field of work that the student is interested in when he or she graduates. Internships will be an example. It allows the student to learn and apply his knowledge according to what has been taught in school. In addition, having a part-time job also means that the student is able to earn extra allowance and learn how to appreciate money instead of depending on the allowance given by parents. There are drawbacks for college students to have a part-time job as well. Firstly, the student may not be good in managing his or her time well. If the student cannot juggle between studies and the part-time job at the same time, he or she will end up doing badly in both the job and school. It is important to note that not all college students are bad in managing their time. Perhaps, having a part-time job will train the student to learn how to juggle his time well and this will not lead to an imbalance between studies and work. To conclude, I feel that having a part-time job is not necessarily important for college students. It has its advantages and disadvantages but it all boils down to how the student is able to manage his or her time well. ",B2
"It has been a hot topic for a long time whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people take it for granted that smoking should be banned, while there are still others who disagree with it. As for me, my favor goes to the former opinion. I have some reasons described in the following. As we all know, smoking is very harmful to our health. What is more, smoke can cause all kinds of disease that it may make a man die. For example, there are a great many of people die of smoking every year. This is the result of smoking. Another reason t for smoking should be banned, especially at the public place, such as restaurants, hospitals, and so on. And it is clear that restaurant is a place we have lunch. If someone next to you always smoke when you eating food, you probably cannot start it., leaving the lunch and wanting to go. As stated above, what should we do? There is no doubt that we should exert all ours energy to ban smoke at all the restaurants in the country. Now, let us start and make progress together!",B1
"Nowadays, a lot of people pay attention to smoking. Smoking makes some people unpleasant and even unhealthy. So the government makes some rules. We must not smoke in some stores, streets and schools. Especially smoking in store is taken notice. Some people disagree with it, but it is very good for most of us to make it. I think so, too. Because smoking doesn't bring useful thing for me. Moreover it brings bad things. For instance, first we spend a lot of money for cigarettes. A person who smokes ten cigarettes in a day spends about 5 thousands yen in a month and 60 thousands yen in a year. Second we also are likely to take serious disease, cancer and stroke, by smoking. This is proved medically. It is very dangerous for not only smoking people but also people who are around smoking people to smoke in narrow place, for example in store. Third, there are a lot of garbage by smoking. Lastly cigarettes smell very bad. In the narrow store, the smoke is shut down and it smells but much more. If the government makes a rule which ban from smoking on all stores, these things is better and some people may stop smoking. So I agree with banning from smoking on all stores.",B1
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Of course, I know that there are many people who smoke every day. However, I think it does not need that people smoke at restaurant. I will show you my opinions. I do not smoke because I do not like the smell of cigarette. When I go for a meal with friends who smoke, I cannot smell and taste meals. I cannot stand the smell of cigarette. I want to eat delicious meals without the smell of cigarette. I do not smoke, so I cannot understand why people smoke at the table. However, it does not mean that smoking should be completely banned at all space in the world. I do not smoke, but I admit that there are people who smoke. However I think there are many people who do not like the smell of cigarette. So, when they go to restaurants, I think they smoke outside the restaurants. You may say that there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at many restaurants. However, both seats do not completely be separated. So, sometimes cigarette smoke flows to nonsmoking seats. Even though smoking seats and nonsmoking seats are separated at some restaurants, I think people who smoke should smell and taste meals without the smell of cigarette. I think it is bad manners to smoke at the table. Because, cooks want to make people happy by his cooking, they cook hard. We should appreciate his cooking. I have heard that people who had smoked get fat as soon as they stopped smoking. It is because they can smell and taste meals more without the cigarette. So, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.",A2
"In my opinion. I think part time job of Thai students are very good, because it help themselves and parent. If their family are poor them must work part time after finish class. Past time job are very necessary for some Thai student, because poor family. It does not easy for someone, but it easy for diligent student, because them must look for money for themselves. I agree with part time job and it is best idea for pool student. However study is the most important than part time job. It have time enough should make, but if not time should not make. Sometime working part time cannot help them, because working help look for money only, but it cannot help good study. If we look into point important of part time job, for example, look for money, using time and save money. After finish work them must do homework and get up to university working part time can make them have not time enough study. While them friend shopping, but them must work part time it very different. I would to talk past time job, it is necessary for some student for example. For pool student and them would like to help parent.",A2
"Today ours human being have more things to addict. Some thing are good and the others are bad. But bad thing must also attractiveness by peer pressure such as alcohols, weeds and cigarettes etc. The easily thing that you can take them in any place and every time that you comfort is cigarette. When you walk on the street you can find the person who was smoking along the ways you would see at least one person. Because there is no smoking prohibited. I will give you and example what plave that have smoking. Restaurant, the place that have every generation of human come in it. Actually who was come to this is come in with family on holidays. What do you think when your family come to restaurant and found that this restaurant allow to smoking. Is this still holidays? Smoking is killing your mood from eating and talking with your family. But it is not important than it kill your family when they breath smoke. In my opinion the government must be approve the laws that smoking prohibited in public. It could be the best if the first place that the laws need concern are restaurant, park and university.",B1
"I do agree this topic because I think teenage is the powerful age. They can do more than they expect and this age can learn fast so it's easy to do many things. I think students should not only study but also learn life through the experience after school by themselves. The value experience is out of class that they should learn because teacher can not give you the real experience. The advantage of doing part-time job, they can earn money by themselves everyone know time is money. I think working for money and experience is the better way than letting time fly for nothing. But it's important to divide suitable time to do everything such as study time, work time, relax time etc. If you spend the time in the wrong way it may impact to your study especially your exam. I think study should come first another is just the way you should learn in your lifestyle. Besides you can get money from your part-time job. You also get useful life skill such as how to work with co-worker, how to manage your emotion, how to make relationship. These experience will make you braver and stronger. And your parents will be proud of you.",B1
"I do not think it is important for a college student to have a part time job. The immediate responsibility of a college student is to his/her studies. I believe that having a part-time job has its perks and advantages such as learning about responsibility and commitment and earning extra money to put into their savings, but having a part-time job also has certain disadvantages that outweigh its advantages. One disadvantage is that it takes up the time of the student. Having a part-time job commits the student to his/her employer. The implication of this is that the student has no choice but to attend to his/her employer. This will give the student less time to focus on his/her studies. Other than that, it tires the student physically and mentally. Usually, college students are given night shifts for their part-time jobs, since they have classes during the day. In a country like the Philippines, where it is difficult to get from one place to another and where the traffic situation is horrendous, you can only imagine the effort it will take to get to school, get to your workplace, then get back home very late. This adds stress to the student and may make him/her inefficient in studies and in work.",B1
"Some people may think that smoking is a behavior, symbolized as a mature person. Some people may think that when they are smoking, they can release their stress and heavy burden for a while. However, smoking is harmful to not only smokers' health but also others'. Therefore, it is actually not mature if you smoke in order to look mature. You do not care about your health. Besides, you do not care about the people around you. The real mature people will take care of themselves and others, because health is the pyramidal cornerstone of life. In addition, if you want to release yourself from tension and stress temporarily, you can chat with friends, see a movie, listen to music, have a journey and so on. There are lots of things can replace smoking. Since smoking can do nothing but do harm to everyone's health. Let's just quit it. It is hard to quit it, nevertheless, if you have been addicted to it for a long time. It is like the drug which makes you very uncomfortable when you do not take it. Worse yet, you may go crazy. At this moment, all you need to do is to keep your perseverance. As long as you stick to it and pass the most difficult time, you will win the better life.",B1
"Millions of people die every year from lung cancer caused by smoking. Many countries prohibit smoking in public areas. However, some people without discipline still smoke in the public areas even if they know that it is prohibited. Smoking in public places such as, restaurants, bars, caffe's must be banned. Restaurants are place for eating and not for smoking. People who smoke in restaurants affect other people who are not smoking called the second hand smokers, and yet they suffer most from inhaling the smell of a cigarette. We all know that many people smoke nowadays so it's only common to see people smoking everywhere they go. Some smokers don't agree with banning smoking in restaurants or even bars but they should also consider the health of others. They should be considerate of the people who do not smoke and for the people who have lung problems such as asthma. Many people today are dying because of lung cancer caused by smoking and or second hand smoke. Someone that smokes knows the risks of smoking and second hand smoke and therefore they should be aware where to smoke by and when it is appropriate to smoke and when it is not. Therefore, I agree with the banning of smoking into public places. A smoker's choice should not affect the health of others. People should be able to enjoy public places without being subjected to smoke. The right to smoke does not mean smokers can subject others to their harmful smoke. People say that they have the freedom to smoke if they want to but they are forgetting people have the freedom of life which smokers take away from them. Smokers should respect this policy not only to obey the law but also to set good example for the younger generation.",B1
"Agree with that should not be smoking in restaurants around the country because the restaurant is a restaurant for dining. A public restaurant to anyone who does not supposed to smoke inside the restaurant. The bad will happen, it does not happen, but with male smoking only But it will affect the people around inside the cylinder with the people. The opinion that smoking in restaurants. But the disadvantages that both the internal and external The image of social outsiders look. The impact that followed. The owner should be made no-smoking signs in restaurants or public places. Smoking is not allowed to see the sign prominently or a restaurant owner should be prepared places for smokers to sit it. It would be better for him be smoke in restaurant. A good government should be a law banning smoking in restaurants or public places that should be advertising to the negative effects of smoking and the distribution more pronounced. And there should be more stringent penalties than ever. To the environment in general society and individuals will be happier to see people smoking, quit smoking. All people who don't smoke will be happy too that they don't smell tobacco and don't get hurt from smoking.",B1
"I believe it is important that all of college students have a part time job during vacation. The biggest reason is that a variety of experiences are good for all of college students. Also, students who have a part time job can prepare for the future in advance. I believe students who have a lot of experiences as a part time job will be able to work very well. Next, having a part time job can reduce a lot of burden for student's parents because they make money in their allowance. Even for me, I did a part time job at LG service center during last summer vacation. Therefore, I made much money during 2 months (about 2 million won); I didn't receive an allowance from my father during 8 months. Finally, having a part time job can meet a variety of friends. For example, I did a part time job in Phoenix Park during 2 months 3 years ago. Then, I fortunately met a lot of people, we became dear friends there. In my opinion, I think all of students would better have a variety of chances in much way. For these reasons, I believe that having a part time job is better.",B1
"Part time job should be necessary for college students because it gives many benefits to students or young generation. In college life mostly youngsters or students have polite or soft mind. Mostly elders opinion is that if somebody saved his mind in college life they saved their mind in whole life. job after class will be very helpful for students to save their selves to go to on wrong way. All bad habits comes if a person will free and have spare time to serve upon them. so when a student serve his whole day in any work so he will never suffer in any bad habit and never go to any wrong side. Another profit of part time job is that a student can become responsible or self dependent or a person can become punctual. With the help of job they will feel their responsibility of his duty. Fulfil orders of their bosses and complete their all duty work will helpful for them to become responsible. By fulfill office work or responsibilities they will start to realize their real life responsibilities or become mature. Go to job on time and does every office work on time will helpful for them to become punctual. Student can become self dependent with the help of job because they earn money from job and they can use this money to fulfill their needs and they will also serve that money on family matters. people have many academic and co- curricular expenditure. Now a days study became very expensive and mostly parents can't afford the expenditure of their children's study. so, student should care about all these problems which faced by their parents. So, they can pay their dues or fulfill their academic expenditure by their own earning. so, on this way they helped their parents or become self dependent. CONCLUSION: By discuss all points we find out that part time job is necessary for college students.",B1
"Nowadays, there are many college students in Taiwan have part time jobs. Why do so many students want to have a job and what kind of jobs do they work? Do they want to earn money or to have some special experience? I don't have any part time jobs, but I want to find one. In my opinion I think if I have a part time job, there is something I would get. First, I can earn money to afford my schooling and my daily expense. Second, through working, I can learn something that would not learn in school such as facing the customers and your boss. At last, I think part time job just like a small society, everything would happen. In my daily life, some classmates of mine also have part tome jobs. Some of them work in cram schools and the others work in restaurants. These jobs are most working students have. Some students also go to abroad such as New Zealand, USA, and England. They work in hotels or farms. I think that also special part time jobs. Not only earn money but also improve language speaking. There are so many jobs can students have, just find one in your learning age. But everything has to be careful.",B1
"I think the college students should have a part-time job because they can learn to work as one portion in society. For example, they will learn how difficult is it to earn money and will not spend money idly. I don't have a part-time job now. But I had worked at super market for one month. In spite of short time, I learned how to handle cash register, earn money, say greeting, behave to customers and etc. There may be an opinion that if the college students have time to work part-time, they should fill up more student life. But today we can have a part-time job if there is time just a little. So they can enjoy student life and have a part-time job. I think that it is better changing various part-time jobs than remaining one part-time job all the time because we can learn various things. For instance, we will find our good point and bad point and the work that fitted oneself. For these reason, the part-time job has many good points for the college students to grow up the adults. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"I agree to the non-smoking restaurant. The restaurant is a public place. If you smoke in many people will be exposed. The people inside the restaurant will be harmed. Will be weakened because the taste of cigarette smokes. Smoking is deadly to children and pregnant women. Would you like to smoke about now? If a restaurant allows smoking in the smoking to the health of people who do not play any more will not come to the restaurant. The restaurant will be full only of smokers. The restaurant will be filled with tobacco smoke; restaurant staff will become addicted to tobacco smoke. Later to leave the restaurant staff, guests also will not come. The restaurant will be shut down, more and more. Cigarette smoke is very dangerous. Once infected and sick people, and to die is exposed. Smoking in restaurants and other public places, not to subliminal. Those who smoke do not smoke should be induced. In order to help people this is never a good Seems like there is reliable.

"I agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons why smoking in the restaurants should be banned such as it annoy other people, it is impolite, it is dangerous for people who sit nearly the person who smoking and it is illegal too. It can annoy other people because of its fog and smell which makes other people is not satisfied, it can annoy people who are eating in the restaurant. Smoking is impolite too because the restaurants do not the place to smoking, if they want to smoke they should go to the smoking place or other place that does not have people. If someone still smokes the cigarette at the public area it can show their personalities which it is impolite. Smoking is dangerous for nearly seat people because in cigarette has Nicotine and Tar which make lung cancer decease for people who smell cigarette's fog. Therefore, smoking in the restaurants in the city should be banned because it is bad for people health who can smell its fog. Moreover, smoking is illegal, there is the law to control people to do following that people should not smoke in public area, if someone breaks the law they will spend fee commission.",B1
"Now many college students want to have a part-time job. But is it important for them to do a part-time job? Some people may think it is vital for them to know more about the society. However, in my opinion, I don't agree with this. I think it is not quite important. Firstly, the reason that so many students want to do the part-time job may be is just that they want to make money by themselves and have more experience. They may work in some fast food restaurant. And the pay is not very high. The part-time job can occupy a lot of their time. So it is not good for their study. Some jobs may ask them to work at night and it is harmful to their health. Secondly, as a college student, the major of the duties is to learn the knowledge. Actually, most of the college students have no special ability or techniques, so their jobs mostly are likely to be waiters or something else that can't help them to improve their professional skills. Thirdly, because the jobs are not close to their professional knowledge and the jobs are somewhat tired and the payis low, they maybe lose heart. In fact, a lot of universities have provided students with many chances to take part in practice. The practice not only won't occupy a lot of time, but also give students enough experience. In short, if one has a lot of free time, he or she can do a part-time job. But it is not important or necessary for college students to do it.",B1
"I agree that it is very important for students to have a part-time job while they are in college. This is because a part-time job is valuable preparation for the future of the student and will also help them to expand their skill set in the ever increasing demands of the modern business world. We learn in business school that a lot of students enter the workforce unprepared to meet the high expectations and required work ethic in many large corporations especially. Since I personally want to find some work in a large corporation, I think it will be necessary to have strong part time experiences, and I have thought so for a long time. Therefore, I have served at three different internships, and when I graduate at the end of this fall of 2011, I am confident in my previous experience will serve me well and I can land a really great job with really great benefits. Then, I will be able to enjoy that good position for many years to come, so my part-time job will have served its purpose perfectly. For any student like me, a part-time job is absolutely essential and is in a prudent preparation for the future.",C2
"There are two reasons to why smoking should be banned in restaurants. The first reason would be because of health purposes. A lot of people have already died suffering from diseases caused by the smoke. And it is not a quick, funny death. The death will be a slow, painful one - torturing one's mind and soul. So many organ dysfunctions can be the result from smoking cigarettes, pot, and also weed. Pancreas, liver, lungs, kidneys and some other body parts can all be shut down after consistently smoking for some time. Smoking in restaurants should be banned because the air inside the restaurant is tightly packed. When smokers light up their cigars, the smoke will tend to spread inside the room, therefore, polluting the small, full of foods area. I do believe the smokers tend to think they are cool when they are smoking, light up a match, put it on the smoke and blow the smoke to someone's face ain't cool to me though. It's a form of disrespect. Some are smoking usually for the sake of being relaxed. They will find living difficult old years of age if one is a heavy smoker even if it is during his/her young years. Moreover, there are people who will suffer more than the smoker itself. These people are the ones who inhale the smoke after the smoker exhales it. We call them the second hand smokers. You see, there is no benefit when smoking cigarettes. To prevent these kinds of tragic incidents, government should ban the production and supply of cigarettes, pot, weed and all other kinds of guilty pleasures in their local civilization. They should also prevent importing these.",B1
"Smoking should not to happened, it should be completely. Now, It has number of the many people are smoking include female so it is differ from the past. At present, smoking has too much in the all age, and gender. We can see who smoking in many students at the present. It should not happen because smoking can decrease age and it make people dead quickly than the past. We should to fight, told to student and people who smoking that smoking can be body damage to a person smokes and person stay near them. It will destroy everything in your life. First, your body is damage may to be cancer in the future. Second, your family and who was near you will receive cigarette smoke and they can not take it, until they stay away from you. After that, your money is finished with the cigarette. The last, you are with nothing left, you will alone with your cigarette. So, for your good left, you mush control yourself and you should turn back to take care yourself. You can stay away from it continually and told to yourself always that don't to smoking for yourself and who your love.",B1
"The cigarette is a drug that is dangerous for everyone both users and people around them. There many diseases that smoking is the main cause of them. Nowadays, there are many organizations which try to stop smoking such as the pictures that paste on products, the television's program that promote about the dangerous of smoking, the signs that you can meet in public places, etc. You can see that signs in many places such as parks, department stores, gas stations and restaurants. The restaurants are a place that people always smoke. It should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the city. The restaurant is the place where many people both adults and children come to. It is a place for family. It should be a safety place. Some restaurants may have non-smoking room but most ones do not have. You may think that follow me when you have meals; you want to have good location and view. If someone smokes, its smell can make you unhappy. Furthermore, you will be unhealthy too. It is an important problem that someone has to improve. The government must use the legal to stop smoking especially, smoking in restaurants and use it completely. It is everyone's responsibility which should do to stop smoking. We have to co-operate to solve this problem. Smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"Smoking is an ill habit. Now a days, it is very common among young generation although its roots and spread everywhere in the world. Smoking is injurious to health. Smoking is adopted by the people to sooth themselves and relax themselves but they are either unaware of it's after effects or want to get rid of this life. Smokers actually don't care to face the reality of life and run away like cowards. Young generation is more include in this evil activity due to its temptation. Smoking cause headache, nausea etc. but the biggest and the foremost problem caused by smoking is destruction of lungs years after years. Smokers become lazy and vague. Sold bread earns become fatigued and unable to run their families. Students are reduced of failure. The above discussion clearly implies that smoking is injurious in all respects to people. But smoking in public places should be restricted especially to avoid or prevent teen ages to get the temptation of smoking. Any smokers could give firstly free of cost (cigarette) to anyone for any purpose. Secondly, the smoker produced or released by cigarette contains concingocnic materials and very harmful gases which may damage the lunges of the person sitting by him. The smoke may enter through nose and then lungs. Restaurant are the place where public come to enjoy or relax to come out of their routine and if anyone is smoking in such a place the outsiders will get a bad site children could be attracted by it and the smoke limited by cigarette could cause long lasting effect on the health of their people. People should be made aware of its effects by organizing seminars and walks.",B1
"No one but longs to be a strong and healthy man. So when asked about whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. I partly agree with this idea and think that we can do something to solve the problem because of the reasons listed below. Firstly, a factor should be taken into consideration is that there are so many people crowded together in restaurants; a terrible smell from the cigarette may pollute the air in the restaurant. People who hate smoking have no way to go if they have their dinners in the restaurant when other people smoke. It is unfair for them. Second, we should emphasize the importance of health. Second hand smoking also can have a terrible influence on our body. It may do harm to our immune system. If we have meal in a room full of smoke for long, we may have some health problems too. Viewing from the two reasons above, the runner of the restaurant can form a smoking room for the smokers. The smoking room is separated from the main restaurant. On the one hand, the room can meet the smokers taste. On the other hand, fresh air is guaranteed in the restaurant. A healthier place is provided to the customer.",B1
"I Strongly agree, The smoking banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is one type of drug that is harmful to themselves and those around the body and Personality is not good. Smoking in restaurants is a very important social manners and into the restaurant all look forward to relaxing. But if there is cigarette smoke and smell. No relaxation will not feel uncomfortable to live the consequences is. Mental bad. Body is not strong. And stress. Restaurant as a place for relaxation, Most of the restaurant customers want convenience. Clean and safe. If the smoking freely in restaurants. Will damage the image of the restaurant. It is not attractive. The present this concept is very popular worldwide. But in the process successfully most countries are strong and growth. Because countries with strong and security. Will see the importance of people and self image in their countries. In Thailand, Help the campaign was successful only in part. Because the media campaign has limited and published less in Thailand. So we must help the campaign seriously. Safety for self and others And prosperity of the country. I will try to be a part of helping a non-smoking restaurant and not just in restaurants only but in Thailand, It must be non-smoking as well.",A2
"The opinions of smoking area are still hot potato. When we go to any restaurants and cafes, we can see smoking area for non-smokers. Why they make a smoking area? I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and cafes in the country. First, if people smoke cigarette in restaurant, non-smoker feel unpleasant. When I went to pub to talk with my friends, some people smoke straight at next table so cigarette smoke was flew to our table. We smelled with own nose about cigarette smoke and everyone felt unpleasant. Also, we wanted to claim to smoker at next table people but we could do this. I think that non-smoker's rights are more important than smoker. Above all things, non-smoker's rights can be respected to protect the health of non-smoker. I heard that second-hand smoking is more dangerous than smoking directly. Second-hand smoking is a big health hazard. Also, being around secondhand smoke increases your risk of emphysema. Especially, children are easily vulnerable to secondhand smoke unconsciously. Maybe, smokers argue own rights of smoking clearly. But if smokers know that non-smokers feel unpleasant and are exacerbated by them, they can't smoke in front of non-smokers anymore. I hope that no one smoke in the world will be coming soon.",B1
"Since most of the family's before face mild or extreme poverty, most of the students got part time jobs in restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores and etc in order to get proper education. They use their salaries to pay for their tuitions, books, clothes and other necessities. That is why dual roles of college students as part time workers and students have been common since our fathers ' time. I remember my father telling me stories about his experiences as a working student during his college years. He said that having the role of a working student was very hard because being able to maintain both his work and studies was a difficult task. There were times when he was exhausted from his work, yet he could not rest because he still had to do his assignments and study for the lessons. But after a period of time, he left his job in order to fully concentrate on his studies. Based on my father's past experiences, I can only say that part time jobs for college students may hinder their goals in getting good grades. Some students may say that they can maintain and excel both their academics and work, but there will come a time when their health might collapse due to exhaustion, extreme pressure and lack of proper sleep. Others may say that they will get part time jobs inside their schools as scholarship grants, but even this may hinder their grades because of the conflicting schedules. They may say that they will find time to finish both their assignments and jobs, but what if their classes are until 5PM and they have no long breaks? College students may take part time jobs as long as they can handle all the workload, manage their grades and maintain their health.",B1
"As is known to us all, college is a place where people look for further education, exchange their academic ideas and finally both enrich their selves for their future career in society and propel the development of all endeavors of society. However, college is not equal to society. College students need opportunities to get in touch with those things beyond campus and accumulate enough practical experiences for their future careers. It is precisely the part-time job that gives such opportunities to college students. Serving in restaurants, working as an intern secretary for a company, or being a salesman selling commodities on short-term sale etc., no matter what part-time job a college student chooses to participate in, she will learn practical skills to adjust to society which academic-centered college cannot teach her. Besides, it should be taken into consideration that part-time jobs do offer a certain amount of money to college students, making some financial income for college students' daily life or even helping them to afford their college study. One of my high school classmates went to a college in Singapore for further education after his graduation, in the first year, his family offered his nearly $15, 000 for study and living expense. Now he is in his senior year, with his part-time job income of nearly $250 per month on average, he will save at least $2, 000 for his family when he get his bachelor degree. During the two years' part-time job, he not only gained money, but also learn things about making contract with a company, getting along with coworker, how a restaurant is arranged and run, etc. Hence, it is important to college students to have a part-time job.",A2
"I agree with the statement. Because I believe that college students should experience a lot of things. In order to live in this world, you need some ability. And it is experiences that give you them. Part-time job provide you with not only money but also experiences. For example, when you success in the job, you can get confidence. When you make some mistakes, you can have a chance getting any solutions. And they will be your skills to do well in this society in the future. Of course there are many things you cannot experience through part-time job. But you will earn money. You could do a lot of things as trip, studying abroad, shopping or love. Part-time job is just kill two birds with one stone. for college students because not only above reason but also you have time and you are free. That is to say you give time and freedom. Why? I believe that society give you the last chance to fly away into the severe world. So you should experience many things to do well in this society. This is important. And I think the best way is Part-time job. Therefore I agree with the statement.",A2
"For the past two years, I have been working part time with an international non-government organization named One Million Lights. Although it's technically a part time job, I perform and operate under the capacity of the Country Head of the Philippines for the organization. My involvement with the organization has been very fulfilling, and has also been very beneficial. First, this part time job of mine keeps me sane. My schedule is always very hectic. Aside from the demands debate and football varsity impose on me, I also have to deal with high expectations in and out of my family. My part time job takes me to another world. It helps me forget about all my problems and channels energy into something new and productive. I guess by taking me out of my usual environment, my part time job at One Million Lights has helped me relax and view new perspectives, especially as I go through college. Second, my part time job allows me to learn new things and hone my current skills. It exposes me to new environments and situations every week. Every encounter is a new experience that I have to learn how to deal with on my own. I guess in this light, my part time job has taught me how to adapt to new things and has helped me become a better person.",B1
" All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. The college students need to work hard in their studies to get good grades. But some students who cannot afford their expenses do part time jobs. This affect their studies badly. They cannot make their way to good universities, to go in a profession of their choice. They find no time to do their homework. Part time jobs also affect the health of students. They try to do their homework and thus, have no time to sleep. They cannot take meals at regular times. Part time jobs make the students frustrated. They find no time for themselves, no entertainment, no refreshment. This affect their nature badly. Working round the clock makes them like a machine and spoil their personality. The age, they have, to enjoy and to live life like what it deserve, is gone in this period. And this time practice takes away their youth and makes them older enough, so that their lives become so dry and mechanical. Thus, students in trying to live on their own or to help their parents not only disturb their health but also their personalities and their future. There should be organizations to help such students. We must care of our future and today's students are the future.",B1
"Being around smokers is, at least for me as a non-smoker and as someone aware of the consequences of cigarette smoking to one's health, not an experience I would like to have in my every day. Walking along the streets, it's something that can be quite bothersome. But more irritating even than that is the presence of those grey clouds of toxins in places where my eating is to take place. And I am in full-support of having smoking banned in all restaurants in the country. Restaurants, or any establishment where any form of eating is to take place, are one of the places where people are most susceptible to the harmful effects of second-hand smoking, which according to studies is even more dangerous than smoking the cigarette itself. People sit down and, usually, take their time, and it is here that exposure to cigarette smoke is prolonged. Public health is endangered in this sense, and that should be enough reason to have smoking banned, at least in places where many people might be affected. I do, however, believe that more than banning smoking in such establishments is the promotion of public health awareness by making efforts to stop smoking altogether. Such will benefit not only the smoker â€“ whose health will be taking a turn for the better â€“ but the whole public.",B1
"Have a part time job for college student is effective because we can learn about it and we can understand that get some money are so difficult. Because we do part time job at least we have a little extra money so that we do not bother parents and we can set aside a little to save. We also get experience from part time job. We have a part time job in the some shop or restaurant like Mc Donald, KFC, or the other. but don't forget, we are college student, we must be smart student. when we have part time job, we also can divide time between working and study. For example, if we get time to study at the morning we can take part time job at the night after finishing our study. so, it is not disturb time to study, but in shipbuilding polytechnic of Surabaya we can't do part time job because everyday is task. that is motto for college student in PPNS â€“ ITS. because I am a student of PPNS â€“ ITS, so I can't do part time job in there.",B1
"As one of the smokers, I strongly oppose the statement. Most non-smokers think that smoking is a bad habit, so they will insist that smoking should be prohibited at all restaurants. But, I think, it's a fool idea. Today, smoking area is separated from non smoking area at most restaurants in Japan. I have never seen a person who is smoking at non smoking area in the restaurant, because he knows that all people around him hate smoking. Some smokers may get out from the restaurant to smoke, but smoking is prohibited in the public place. So, if smoking was banned at all restaurants, smokers couldn't eat dinner at restaurant. Then, non smokers should suggest that smokers stand smoking when they are at restaurant. I think it is a hard thing for smokers. People usually go to restaurant or cafe to eat foods, have a break, and chat with friends. Everyone wants to take a rest. Cigarettes must be important for smokers to relax. This statement is a selfish idea of non smokers. They often think they are victims of smokers. Such people don't understand the feeling of smokers who choose the smoking area not to irritate non smokers. So restaurants should have the smoking area to save the smokers' rights.",B1
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays many college students have a part-time job. Some students did it for keep their experience, make money or for fun. But I think part-time job not good for all college students, it good for some students only. Because if college students did a part-time job they will have effect on their study and they don't have time to read or practice their learning. For some students can not arrange their time and have a bad grade, they should not did a part-time job. But if they want to do it they will wait for a good time, for example summer, holiday or their free time. Because they should keep time for study and read book. Moreover part-time job is have a good point also. It is students can make money by themselves. And they can help their parent about income and save money of family. When they need something they can buy it buy themselves don't have to disturb their parent. Whatever part-time job is not important for college students because students must be learn and grow up follow by their age. Job will make students grow over age. And if college students have problem about money for study they can request scholarship. Today have a many scholarship for poor students and good students. I think scholarship is better than college students did a part-time job.",B1
Part time job is actually a type of job that a person carry to fulfill its daily needs either he is profferional or a student. Part time job is a limited time period job. Person does not completely depends on part time job. For the student that think that they would not want to become burden on family any more so they usually take this path to fulfill his needs but most correctly it is also take as an extra time involvement of a person to overcome poverty and needs of his family. Head of family also carries such extra time facilities to keep his family happy. Part time job sometimes has many disadvantages regarding a person individual life and also effect a society when an individual goes for part time job then he is to take extra time for his family that effects its parents and children life. Part time job also affects a well-established society that has some specific roles and principles. Such as in Europe the limited hours of week you can do a job. But if you keep breaking limitations of hours then you are breaking a low of country and its roles and that directly affects the society. Hence it is concluded that part time job must be taken in account if it is does not break low of state or society.,B1
"Nowadays, there are more and more college students choose to have a part time job. Surely, a partime job can provide cash and working experience to them but part time job would occupy college students a lot of precious time, which should be used to learn knowledge and skills in class without worries of work stress. Also the colleges or universities like the Adamson University provide students a community to fit in the real world, so that students can develop these necessary qualities and skills. I think it's definitely not a wise option to take a part-time job in exchange of losing some parts of such important opportunities of education. It's known to almost everyone that to become a college is one of the important ways to change one's life. The main task of students is studying hard so that after graduation, they may get a good degree, which offers them a better opportunity forwell-paid jobs. they will have no longer enough time to finish homework assigned or enchance their knowledge through reading books. At the same time, they will fall behind the class schedule. In other words, part time job is responsible for students ' bad study result.",B1
"Part time job I strongly agree with the topic part time job because I am working as a part time worker. I earned more money. Furthermore; I have been gained a lot of useful experiences for doing this kind of job. In other words; I knew that how I should do when I work with many people. Besides; I have a great chance to practice or work before I have graduated. According to these reasons and experiences, part time job can not only give anyone some money but many good experiences are also given to anyone who do this type of job. In the moment, one of the best ways to find any money is part time job. Especially; the students who would like to be given more money to buy anything that he or she want. It means that most students choose to take this kind of job to do to earn more money. The part time job can be many kind of job e. g. coffee's shop, department stores, book stores, Big C, Seven-Eleven, and etc. so, a lot of my friends work at coffee's shops because they do love to do and it's near their university. In addition; they would like to know how to be a professional worker or waiter as they have to do the job after they have finished their bachelor's degree. That is why they do like to do this part time job. To conclude, part time job is very useful for any students or anyone who want to earn more money and practice more experiences. Especially, students who do not need to worry their parents. In my opinion, this kind of job will give you more than what you think that nobody can give you.",B1
"Many students are having part time jobs these days. It became one of the cultures among young people. They work at cafè¾¿, fast food store, a convenient store and so on. Mostly the reason they look for part time jobs is to earn money because there are many things they want to buy in twenties. But some other says that having a part time is an important experience to learn a real world. I don't agree with that. It might be helpful if a student has a part time job just for a month. One month is enough time to learn how hard earning money is or how tough this world is. But if the student works for a long time, I think that is the time to have problems. The works they do is usually mere work not professional. They easily get tired compare to others who don't have a part time job and it also influence their grades. I think school grades, traveling, chasing dream are the things truly important to young people. There are so many thing they should care bating part time jobs. I think if you want to experience the world, an intern ship would be better than a part time job.",B2
"I am one of the angry peoples who couldn't enjoy their meals when someone is smoking at the restaurant. So if someone asks me Do you think smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants? I will absolutely say Yes! As it is known to us, smoking is bad for us. Some people like smoking very much and can't live without cigarettes even though it writes Smoking is bad for your health on every cigarette case. I have no right to command you to get rid of smoking and you have also no right to destroy my health and even my life. We should respect and understand each other. Please smoke in private instead of in public! There are more reasons for this as follows: Firstly, restaurants are the place of eating and drinking rather than smoking. If you usually smoke at the restaurant, the other customers will be interrupted and don't feel happy. In the long run, it will contribute to the decrease of the restaurant's sale. Secondly, smoking is sometimes dangerous and may cause a fire disaster. If someone throw the cigarette on the xylem floor or near the curtain, it is easy to cause a fire and lead to a tragedy. Thirdly, your smoking at a restaurant will give your friends and partners a bad impression. Everyone wants to be polite and friendly in the front of his or her friends. Smoking at the restaurant will destroy your appearance. From what has been mentioned above, we can come to the conclusion that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. It is good for the smokers' impression, the others' health and also the safety of the public!",B1
"Without really knowing much about the culture or the people of Japan, it would be a little ignorant for me to make a statement on this issue that would have any real impact. However, I am comfortable in stating my opinion that smoking is a terrible habit, and I try to avoid smokers in my personal and professional life as much as possible. Is extremely frustrating to work with somebody who has to leave several times throughout the hour to go engage in some activity that is literally killing them by the day, and I do not wish this fate upon even my worst enemies. As one continues their career in college, one expects himself/herself and also the people around them too overall become smarter and better people. Smoking is kind of a curious habit that has remained for reasons I cannot fully understand, but I hope that one day soon we will not have to worry about it anymore. The number of deaths every year from smoking is higher than the number of deaths from car crashes and other accidents combined, and the figures really speak volumes about the choices people are making which have direct influences on their very lives. If I had to say one way or the other, I think it would be better to lean towards the side of caution and just go ahead and ban smoking at the restaurants in Japan.",C2
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Some points that the only reason that this topic is being tackled is due to the health problems that smoking causes to the non-smokers but it will be unfair to the smokers if this rule happens. First off, most if not all restaurants in the country have portions in their restaurants designated as for smokers, hence giving a place for these smokers to smoke and not affect the non-smokers. Once this rule is applied to the country, there might be an economic disaster waiting to happen because cigarette is one big portion of the country's economy. In Metro Manila alone, I believe there are two cigarette factories and if this rule happens, it will ruin the lives of the workers in these factories hence bringing less investment in our country. It will create a disastrous effect in the economy of the country because just this year, the MMDA has imposed a no smoking rule to public places. It has shut down a lot of smoking spots that lessened the buying rate of cigarettes to its consumers. Adding this other rule would drastically change the minds of its consumers and makers that it might force the makers to pull back its investments here in our country, greatly damaging the economy of the country. It won't guarantee the success of the project to lessen air pollution because it is not the cigarettes that really pollute the air but the gas from cars and factories. We may all now that cigarettes do damage the lungs especially the second hand smokers but taking out smoking in restaurants doesn't guarantee that these smokers will stop. Hence I disagree that smoking should be completely banned to all restaurants in the country.",B2
"Do you know the word part time? Part time is mean free time that you have in a day. Next, what the word part time job mean? I think you know the word. It's mean working in your free time for money or any. Nowadays many people do a job after his main work because they want more money. Part time job is a good way to find it. You can be a waiter in restaurant, throwing newspaper in the morning before you go to work, sending milk, etc. That is a good part time job that I can do in main work day. In weekend I spend my time working at book storage that is good a place to make money. I earn 70 baths per hours. I do many thing there such sold a book and cleaning room. I work there at 8 am to 1 pm and then I get a job at restaurant near my home. In the restaurant I am a waiter. I earn 100 baths per hours. In 2 days I can make more 700 baths. That's sound great? I can buy everything that I want. Part time job is a good way to find money. If you think you don't have money to spend. You should get a part time job but if you don't have time, it over.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants although it arouses a huge controversy. Second-hand smoke affects health is common knowledge. It is unfair to non-smoker if smoking is not banned in a closed area. Furthermore, Restaurant is a place that children and elderly are able to get in. It causes a more severe impact on their health especially as they are vulnerable. On the other hand, smokers can go to public areas to smoke, but not at the restaurants. Some smokers claim that the implementation of smoking ban deprives of their freedom. In fact, it is not true. Stopping from smoking do not affect smokers' health, however, passive smoking affects the health of non-smokers. Non-smokers do not have choice. They suffer more than smokers if smoking ban is not implemented. There is a suggestion that setting up of smoking area from non-smoking area is a win-win situation. As we cannot avoid smoke from passing to non-smoking area, it is not a solution to passive smoking. In addition, the size of restaurants in Hong Kong is very small. It is impossible to keep a distance from smoking area to non-smoking area. Therefore, complete smoking ban at all restaurants is necessary. As we gain nothing from smoking by any means, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.",B1
"Part time job is a good idea Yes I agree if a college student takes a part time job because we can studying to discipline in your life and we can studying for stand alone, we can studying look for money and cost for life. Money is the first problem to life because in life money is special to school, study, shopping, eat, buy book and any more. Part time job for study judgment and study to adult. Part time job good to students, university student, and any more people. Student can part time job are High school for example in US students in high school can part time job become teacher private, waiters, waitress, DJ and any more, In Korea student in high school can part time job become singer, dancer, DJ, teacher private, waiters, waitress, In Indonesia student in high school can part time job become singer, dancer, private teacher, waiters, waitress, business women, business man, novelist, programmer computer, presenter. University student can part time job become private teacher, waiters, waitress, singer, dancer, bussinessman, presenter and any more but many university student part time job become singers wedding, dancer wedding, private teacher, wedding organizer, DJ, waiters, waitress, novelist, programmer computer, presenter in wedding, television or radio, artist, businessman and any more.

"In the whole world, smoking is a great problem of pollution. So I think smoking should be banned in public place. Especially in restaurants it should be banned. Because if you imagine that you are sitting in a expensive restaurant and unable to enjoy the meal due to the cloud of smoke coming from a neighbors table. It is very uncomfortable for non smokers and for your family. If your family members include grand father, grand mother, your parents etc. your family inhaling the cloud of cigarette can be very dangerous. It is bad enough that automobiles, processing plants, and other types of industries which pollute our environment. So in all restaurants, non smokers have a right to clean air as they can enjoy their meal. In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants. Because restaurant is a public place. In a restaurant smoking create a bad impact on children. Because in restaurants many children are fascinated by the act of smoking. After seeing that they try to use it, which may later develop into a habit. Smoking is also a great cause of health diseases, both for smokers and non smokers. Because it is filled with tobacco. There is nicotine in its smoke. Also a cause of a number of cancers and heart problems. For example lung cancer, heart attack etc. So a ban on smoking in all public places would greatly decrease the health diseases. Frankly I believe smoking is complete wastage of time and money. Smokers just look stupid. They are criticized and judged daily by strangers just for having a cigarette in their mouth. So I agree with it that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.",B1
 Man is a social animal no one can fullfill his necessities by living alone in this world. with the increase in population man's necessities are also going to be increased to such a large extent that he is totally confused. At one time he thanks that he should have right to live but at next moment he is totally dishearten that he wants to finish his life. Part time job is something debated to this in which a person does a work more than his abilities. Part time job is type of job in which a person mostly students do studies and job at a time they do this because they have no further means to continue their studies. Why we do part time job ? In Pakistan people are searching for food water and shelter. There is a very high rate of unemployment. When a child born parents can afford his schooling. They can afford his uniforms books and other things he require. Then with lots of efforts time of intermediate comes at this stage students are in start of dilemma. Parents have no enough sources to feed their children. Then to get rid of this situation students do part time job in the morning time they attend their classes. And after that they perform their part time jobs. Most of the students lost their lot of energy. It is said that nothing is impossible . then why we can not reduce part time jobs. Everyone has to take step at individual level. Our Govt. has to take very high step. Govt. has to provide highly qualified staff in professional colleges and reduce the education fees also. Talented students must be awarded with scholarships. Nothing is impossible. With the help of Allah almighty we can do everything. We have to reduce the rate of part time jobs so that our talented students do not waste their talent in part time activities.,B1
"Smoking is bad to every people at everywhere and anytime. Today, it becomes a part to most human life. Smoking can cause in many diseases such as cancer. Smoking not only causes problems to smoker but also to innocence people. Many people die every year because of smoking. However, smoking still becomes popular until today. Today, the rate of smokers is increasing. We can find them anywhere even in restaurants. They are harming people's life. They can't stop because smoking is like a drug addict. In restaurant, people want fresh air to breathe when they eat. Person that smokes in restaurant has no manner. We can only hope that there will be a decreasing of smokers. Stop-smoking campaigns as we see today can decrease a little. If we want to decrease the amount of smokers, we should help together. Smoking should be banned at every place not only restaurants. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is impossible to make people stop smoking. This world will be better and many people will be healthier if we can decrease the amount of smokers. Finally, smoking will harm yourself and other people if you don't stop now.",B1
"part time job is important before entering the existence necessary company, part time job is also helped on the basis of previously learned experience that bring more proficient self-development and make money also seems to send them to prevent a waste time depending on the job, but with as many people seem to be good and part time job is add to confident so when all job to do, rather than other people i am more great deal, but part time deprive individual time so many people So many people and there is little time to communicate Sometimes friends are often encountered in the story And two kinds of part-time jobs only imagine how difficult it is to catch rabbits.

"Nowadays, education is the most important for people who apply to their works in the future. Certainly most of the graduate students can do a work as they like it, had studied at their department or program in the university. Somebody may work in different task from their program and the other may be unemployed. These results may depend on knowledge level and experience in each person, for example someone has well knowledge but may be less their experience or some has low level of their knowledge but may be very good for the experience. After having graduated, the high experience man will do work better than the low experience man. So the student should find to do a little task (part-time job) for the new various experience such as conversation with people, planning the time, practice our tolerance, bring your knowledge to apply with the part-time job etc. Moreover the students will get the good suggestion from people who did work before. However we shouldn't leave our studying because we are students who have the main work which is learning more and more to get a lot of knowledge. As a result of fundamental of working base from the knowledge.",B1
"In my opinion, I think that having a part-time job is essential for college students. It provides them several advantages. For one, it will give them something to be busy about. College students are to be considered as adults already for they are expected to be mature enough to know how to use their time wisely. Instead of using their leisure time for senseless things, having a part-time job will make them more productive and more skilful. Since college students are just one step away from having a work or job already, it will be beneficial to them if they will have even a little overview as to how it is like in the real world. They will be exposed to the kind of environment that they might be in once they actually start working. They will be more aware to the right kind of attitudes and behaviors that must be practiced in their respective working area. The experience that they will gain in having a part-time job will give them an edge over the others for they may include it in their resume when they will be applying for a job in the near future. Moreover, it may be a help to their parents for they may earn extra money or income that can also help in their everyday expenses.",B1
"It is not important for college students to have a part-time job. First and foremost, it can be physically straining for the students should they take up a part-time job. Having a part-time job would mean that a student would have to travel to the workplace, work for a stipulated number of hours and then travel back home. On top of that, the student would have to travel to school and sit in lectures for long periods of time. Over time, the student would feel physically tired trying to balance out work and school. This could negatively influence their grades since the student is not in tip-top condition to study effectively. Therefore, it is not advisable for college students to take up a part-time job. Also, the time spent earning money while doing a part-time job can be used for revision instead. With more time for revision, the student would be less likely to suffer from stress due to last minute cramming for the exams. Hence, it would be a better idea to dedicate the extra time that they have to their studies instead of working part-time. Lastly, one may argue that a student can gain more pocket money or support the family through working part-time. However, if the student is truly in need of finances, one can always apply for financial assistance to alleviate their financial strain. Thus, there is no need for one to take up a part-time job while one is studying in college. In conclusion, the most important job for a student is to work hard in their studies so that they can excel and in future, they would be able to land a proper full-time job. In conclusion, the most important job for a student is to work hard in their studies so that they can excel and in future, they would be able to land a proper full-time job. ",B2
"I agree with this statement. There are three reasons why I think it is important. First of all, through a part time job we can experience and learn many things which we can not in our school life. When we graduate the college and get a job, the experiences is very important. Second, we can really learn the importance of money. Almost all of us have lived using money which our parents had earned. We might take it granted that we have money and can use it. We know getting money is very difficult. However we don't know how difficult it is in real sense. We can not learn the difficulty until we have a part time job. When we experience the difficulty, we know the importance of money for the first time, and we begin to thank our parents. Third, college students have many free times. Of course studying is the most important section of students. However, I realized the fact; even if, we study very hard, we have more free times than when we were high school students. Now, I don't have any part time jobs. When the classes are end, I don't have what to do, and go karaoke, boring or so on. As the result money disappears from my wallet. If I have a part time job, I get money and I don't have any times to use money. It is just like killing two birds with one stone.",A2
Smoking in restaurants will affect other dinners specially those children and senescence people. And it is not proper to smoke in place where foods are serving and with other people on your side. So it is just right to banned smoking in restaurants. In smoking in this place many people are harm and being a secondhand smoker tends to have more bad effect. And they should not only ban smoking in restaurants but also in all public areas. They can smoke but only in the place where no one can be harm. And there are lots of ways in relaxing other than smoking. They also use smoking in relieving stress but there are other forms of stress relieving activities. Reason for some people for smoking inside a restaurant is for their digesting food because some people said that it helps them to digest. But I think it really helps them maybe they always think that way and even though it is not true they still believe on it. Stop or making a law that banned smoking in restaurants will be useful in many ways because for me I 'm in a restaurant and someone will smoke I'll feel disrespect. For the reason that I 'm eating then suddenly I can smell the cigarette of other people and beside his is not the only customer in that restaurant.,B1
"I think smoking is a bad activity that can disturb our body and another people around the smoker. Peoples usually smoke after they eat food or drink a cup of coffee. It is the reason why restaurant didn't banned smoking at the restaurant. But, many people who not smoker banned smoking because it give disadvantage to their body as the passive smoker. In my opinion, I disagree with statement that Smoking should be completely banned at all, the restaurant in the country because it disadvantages the restaurant. The most disadvantages for the restaurant is decreases number of costumers because it decrease revenue of the restaurant and the restaurant can be closed. But, if the restaurants do not banned smoking, they also decrease revenue of the restaurant. So, the resolve of this problem is the restaurant must make smoking area and rule to the costumer. Smoking area is important because people who smoking can enjoy their cigarette and people who not smoking do not get the effect of the smoke from the cigarette. The restaurant not only make smoking area but also make a rule because if there is not a rule the smoking area not useful. It is a simple rule. If the smokers want to smoke after eat or drink something, they must choose smoke area.",B1
"I will explain about part time job's requirement. I think that we must experience a part time job. There are five reasons of my opinion. First, we will go to company after graduation. The company demands various experience because the company wants to a man with a varied career. The companies don't like a beginner. Because they don't know about an applicant's ability. Second, a part time job gives a social nature to part timer. Because when a part timer works in work place, he meets many people. He experiences many situations. Third, we can make money. A part timer gets paid for his labor. Forth, we have a lot of job for a while. We have many different jobs so, we experience various lives. After part time job, we can have a big dream and realize a dream. Fifth, we can live productive life. And we can have positive thinking. So we will live a good life. There are many reasons about part time job's strength. For such a reason, so we have to experience a part time job. Therefore, experience of the part time job require is very important to everyone. We have got to part time jobs that wanting a better life.",A2
"Smoking is a big problem in our society. In many places, we will see a lot of people smoking. Although we have warning that smoking is a bad for people' health, it cannot control people stop smoking. And it is quite difficult to be limit people. Restaurants are the places that many people want to go there for relaxing and eating food in a comfortable condition. So the restaurant should be clean and without any pollutions such as noise, smoking. Especially smoking, it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. If there is someone smoking in there, it is disturbing to other people who are in the same restaurant. For example, I saw one smoking in the food store and I felt bad and do not want to sit in that store. More over, it also makes others' health be bad too. In conclusion, we will see that smoking in the restaurants is not good for anyone. It may destroy happiness of people who want to relax and eat food in the good condition. It also makes health of another and you are worse too. Thus I disagree that allow smoking in all the restaurants in the country",B1
"I think it is good but necessary for college students to have a part-time job. It is good to have some working experiments in school. More working experiments might help you have more chance than the other to get the job you want after you leaving school. This means, it may bring you more competitive capacity than others. And you can also learn how to get along with people, and understand the difficulty of earning money. It may make you more mature. But in the other way, as we may spend almost whole the rest of our life to seek and work hard for money, I don't think it is necessary for us to start it in our school life. People always want to be adults in their childhood; and want to be students when they started working. There are many things we can do only in school. Unless there are economy problems, I don't think the time the part-time job cost is worthy. Moreover, for those who cannot arrange their time well, it is possible to spend too much time and energy on the part-time job, which cause they overpass their school grades. Thus, if there are no reasons, enjoy your college life. Don't be too eager to step in your business life, or you may regret with it.",B1
"Everyone knows that smoking is bad for people's health. It is even more serious in public, because people around the smoker also breathe the harmful gas. Experts have announced that smoking has a more serious effect on other people not the smoker, because it conclude many gas which will cause cancer. Government has noticed that, so they take some measures to protect people from suffer the disease, but it is doubtful whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Maybe someone think it's too strict. Well, let's see; if a behavior may cause diseases in a large environment, do you want it exist? Do you want to suffer diseases? Of course not. So, not only to smokers, but also to the people around him or her, it is acceptable to ban smoking at all restaurants. First, smoking is bad for people's health. It will result in troubles at people's lung. Second, when in restaurants, people are all enjoying a beautiful meal, when there is someone smoking, the smell of cigarette would make people feel uncomfortable, angry, even mad, so as restaurant itself, it needs to forbid smoking. So, as our college students, we should avoid smoking, or at least, not smoking in public. It is a primary common sense that everyone should obey. In order to protect people's health, we need to ban smoking in all restaurants. It will do good to everyone, also restaurants.",B1
"For a great variety of reasons, it is very important for college students to hold a part-time job while they complete their degrees. First, a part-time job can teach them how to be responsible, and they can also learn to work is just one small piece of a larger organization. Too many American youths do not seem to have any sense of punctuality and seem to come and go as they please. This is not such a big deal in high school or in their private lives, but when it comes time to find a fulltime job after graduation, it is very important to be punctual and be on time especially in meetings and other situations where other people are depending upon you to be there. Next, it has become apparent to me since my daughter was born that young kids and especially teenagers do not really understand the value of money or the meaning of a hard day of work. When they want something, they simply ask their parents for money, and most parents do not know how to say no. This leads to spoiled kids who will have a very difficult time adapting to the business world. Therefore, for these reasons and many more, having a part-time job can provide many benefits to the average college student.",C2
"Part time jobs are mainly observed in western countries although in Pakistan a few percentage of people are found. Part time jobs differs in situation wise. Mainly it is done by poor students who could not afford their academics expenses. part time jobs are performed in different forms i. e by working as a sales man, waiter, cashier or even having tuitions. Such kind of activity although is a source of assistant for their financial crisis but has a negative role regarding their studies, daily routines and even for their health situation. His main focus will be towards his income not paying too much heed towards his studies and health. It has few positive aspects also. It creates a sense of responsibility, a way of support to their finance. If part time job is done in their own field of subject then it will be an extra and practical help to their studies. If some one has the capability to manage his daily routine even doing part time job then its better to do a part time job then remaining free and he secures himself from bad company. The preference depends upon the individual himself. If he wants to do a part time job, he may get some time, otherwise he may want to spend this time with his family or friends.",B1
"In recent year, many scholars or even government are hoping to ban smoking at all restaurants. Many studies are also indicated that people who live in a smoking-free area can keep a health body easily. In the following essay, I will go through some advantages, which are related to banning smoking at all restaurants. First of all, the number of people who are suffering from the second-hand smoke can be reduced. According to different studies, it is mentioned that second-hand smoke is dangerous than the smoke came from the tobacco. The smoke came from tobacco is also called first-hand smoke. If the government are publishing a law to completely banning smoking at all restaurants, the opportunity of getting second-hand smoke during eating, drinking or even chatting in the restaurants will be reduced. Moreover, some people can get rid of smoking due to banning smoking at all restaurants. People are needed to go to restaurant having breakfast, lunch or even dinner. Therefore, people are forced to get rid of smoking. On the other hand, since lung cancer is the top killer within different diseases, people are not willing to get such disease. If the law regarding banning smoking at all restaurants can be published, the chance of getting lung cancer can also be decreased because people are restricted to smoke at a limit area. To conclude, banning smoking at all restaurants is having many advantages. I think smoking should be prohibited at all area in the future. Therefore, I agree banning smoking at all restaurants now.",B1
"Part time job is very important for college students. The statement was made based on my own reason. First, have a part time job will be useful for us one day in the future. We could learn how to earn our own money, how to manage our income, and many other things so the time we have will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part time job could reduce our family's financial problem even if it's just a little. Second, we must admit, sometimes, the money that is transferred monthly by our parents is not enough for our daily need. Earning money by ourselves will be a very helpful thing so we won't burden our parents by asking more money. They also can't complain about how we are going to use it because it's the money that we earn, so we have the right to manage it by ourselves. Last but not least, part time job helps us to be independent. It gives us experience to handle the problems we will face in our full time job in the future. It also helps us to learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, or how to handle the problems those occurred by them. It's also easier to find a job if we have the experience to work for the other people. For example, if we ever had a job and want to find a new job, our chance to be accepted is higher than the ones who never have a job at all. So I conclude that having a part time job is very important for college students.",B2
"Smoking in all restaurants in the country should really be banned. First of all, the main purpose of restaurants is for eating and not for smoking. Some smokers smoke in restaurants because it is their habit to smoke after meals. Some customers just smoke and smoke and do not care about the other customers. Cigarette smoke is very dangerous to one's health. We can get different kind of diseases in it. If one smoke in a restaurant, the smoke can spread there thus people will breathe and smell it. The chemicals in the smoke can also be breathed. With that, many types of diseases can be spread by this second hand smoke. It may cause lung cancer, heart disease and other respiratory diseases. Some people also get dizzy when they smell cigarette smoke. Cigarettes may also cause fire when not disposed properly. Restaurants should make a law regarding smoking cigarette. They should not allow people to smoke inside because of its effects. They should put no smoking signs inside so that smoking customers will not smoke. Restaurants can also build smoking area so that smokers can have a place for smoking. A fine may also be an effective way to avoid customer dissatisfaction.",B1
I agree with smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country because smoking isn't benefit for every one. I don't know why people still smoking although they know about disadvantage about smoking. In ciggarate one each has many toxin and these toxin make everyone to have worse health and it might be the lung cancer if you smoke it very much and long time. Smoking in the restaurant not only you that have a bad health but also every one near you will lost a good health too. If you want to smoking you should to go to outside but I think the good way to fix this problem is form a new law about smoking in the restaurant. If you smoking in the restaurant you have to pay alot money or go to the jail 2-3 month it will make to know about smoking in the public is not good. Smoking will make you look not good. I think if you want to good looking it has manything that you can do except smoking for example playing sport play the music sing a song and anything that you can do. This is why I agree with smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.,B1
"Cigarette is the most deadly stuff humans consume in the world. Smoking cigarettes cause most people die because of lung cancer or heart disease. But most people still consume it because smoker said it make them feel calm. Unfortunately they have addicted with cigarette because of nicotine. Many country has make a rule for not smoking at the some area. For make a fresh air and not harm other people (called passive smoker). Smoking is not healthy for body because most inside the cigarette is dangerous chemical. That's why that a rule for not smoking for person under 18 years old, because it make a huge effect for a child. Many must effort to stop smoking but it's very hard because they have addicted with a cigarette. Usually they use a gum for change a cigarette. It may work for some people but may it not work too. So if you do not want harm yourself, your family or other people, stop smoking right now and if you are smoker, and don't ever touch the cigarette any more.

"Part time jobs have been popular among college students. Some hope to be more financially independent of his or her family, while others deem it exciting and fresh to have a part time job experience. I think before one starts his or her part time job, he or she should be fully prepared, both physically and mentally. For those who have already fill their daily schedule with classes and extracurricular activities, the only portion of time that is left available for a part time job can be that is required for rest. In this way, a part time job is undoubtedly posing threat to one's energy and health. It has been the case that many dedicate themselves to their part time jobs while their curricula at school, which should have been their higher priority, are laid less emphasis or even abandoned. Absurdly, one might earn money that is less in figure than the cost of skipping classes, which are paid for to attend. What's more, time spent on one's part time job can be either spared from time that is meant for studying or entertainment, while the former is often preferred so that one's performance at school is affected dramatically. As a way to earn extra money and for social learning, a part time job shouldn't be a burden that does harm to your studies and health. One should take all those things into account before he or she begins a part time job career, or the cost will turn out to be so huge that one can't restore.",B1

Smoking not only hurts ones' personal healthy, but also give others some bad effect. And restaurants are public place, many people can be influenced. As a special place, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Another reason is that smoking is bad to society. Everyone hope to live in a beautiful surrounding. But smoker often throw matches and cigarette butts on the ground. And many people smoked in public. This will bring many troubles to surrounding people. As you know second hand smoke is just as harmful as first hand smoke and make damage to fetus and child. So smoking is not a personal problem.

Last I heard, Japan's voters, the majority of who are smokers, weren't too keen on that idea and cracked it down. I could have got it wrong of course and maybe it will happen. I'd support it for sure because we are used to it where I come from. Smoking bans that is. If we want to have a fag, then outside is the place to go unless they have special rooms in London for the gentleman's clubs. The only little pubs and restaurants that I were in when I was in Japan were all stuffy, cramped little places where it was hard enough to find a seat without trying to breathe as well. We need to think of the little ones you know. It's the kids we don't want to get started on smoking and it would be nice to take them to a clean air restaurant in Tokyo one day. Especially in winter when it's nice to stay indoors and stay warm without having to worry about the stink or my kids' health. Anyway, I hope Japan goes ahead with it.",C2

When student have 16-20 years old, their parents will suggest to them for only study. Thailand college student must only study and shouldn't think in another topic This reason, Thai students don't have ability in use the life in social because they never do any thing in this period.

"It is necessary for college student to have part-time job. First, through the experience of part-time job, they can find their aptitude for their future career. Let's suppose there is a college student who is interested in running restaurant. If she works in a restaurant or a firm as a part-timer and has a chance to see the real business situation very closely, she can reflect it to her process of job decision more easily. Second, doing a part-time job can help college student developing social skills such as communication strategy, making good relationship with strangers, and teamwork. Although a student works for a trivial part comparing to the entire process in her part-time job, such as photocopying, cleaning, or typing, she should have a sense of responsibility and cannot help communicating with other people. Third, doing part-time job leads college students to be independent economically from their family. Considering the fact that they are adults and member of the society, they need to be independent from the parents care.

"I agree to a certain extent. Smoking is not only bad for health which leads to heart disease and cancer, it also affects the environment. By banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country, it will bring an advantage to the non-smokers and a disadvantage to the smokers. The advantage is that it will reduce the generation of secondhand smoke by smokers and enable non-smoking diners to dine at ease without having to inhale the secondhand smoke. The disadvantage is that there will be less public places for smokers to smoke and hopefully it will reduce their frequency of smoking eventually. If there is no complete banning, some inconsiderate smokers will smoke at their tables for the sake of convenience while some considerate smokers will go outside the restaurant and find a place to smoke. However, nobody should restrict where smokers may smoke as they have their own rights and freedoms. It is not their fault for choosing to smoke as they have their own choices despite knowing the harmful effects of smoking. They may smoke anywhere as long as they do not affect non-smokers. Some non-smokers are very particular about secondhand smoke as they know the harmful effects of it while some non-smokers are nonchalant about it. ",B1
"Some people may think that university students should focus on studying; they have needed not to work yet. However, I think having a part-time job is one part in university life. There are my points of view. First, having part-time job can gain working experience. As everyone saw the news that a Chinese University master cannot get a job, we should need to build up our resume in order to show our quality to persuade employer to hire. We must accommodate to be a worker so we need to have a part-time job first. Everything needs buffer, we may face difficulty if we suddenly change own life style. As a result, we need to work partly, and then we can work successfully. Besides, students can earn some money for daily life. All of us know that the tuition fee costs $40, 000 a year, and travelling fee is not cheap too. It may be a burden for the family. Thus, having a part-time job is a very good way to reduce the stress caused by the extra expense. University students are mature people, so we have responsibility to control our personal finance, try to decrease the expense which is less than income. Thus, we can be a successful people in the future, avoid facing financial problem. In conclusion, having a part-time job is important and will not waste some much time. Students must balance their time and spare some time for working.",B1
"In order to be an independent adult, we have to work in our student life. We will get much money and experience. Learning how to live in the world.

"Is earning money and experience important for us? For university students, I think every of them should have to find a part-time job. It is not only for the money but also for the future. First of all, for every university student, they have to play $42100 for every year. It is such a big deal for a lower-income family. Having a part-time job can help to alleviate the family's burden. For me, I come from a family which is poor. It is hard for my family to pay the money involved. Although the salary of part-time job is not enough high, there is no doubt that it can help for the total amount. Secondly, a university graduate cannot fit all the requirements that the employers need. We can learn experiences during the part-time job such as communication skills through us and the clients or other useful skills. This is a prerequisite for getting a good-pay job and it just makes the life happier. To conclude, having a part-time job has a lots of benefits, it is highly recommended to do it. Just find a job now!",B1
"It goes without saying that smoking do has bad influences on our bodies. If we keep smoking for a long period, we may be addicted to it as a result of the substance in the smoke named nicotine. It is possible that we are too addicted to quit smoking as we realize that smoking is such a terrible thing, unless we have the great determination and willpower to overcome all the difficulties we may meet during the time of quitting smoking. Besides this, smoking will weaken our lungs and increase the probability of suffering from lung cancer. Provided that we suffer from lung cancer, it will make not only ourselves uncomfortable but our family unhappy and worried about us as well, and the worst one is that we may even die because of it. Moreover, when smoking, we produce a kind of material which is so-called ""second-hand smoke"". Second-hand smoke will affect people around the smokers, making their health become bad. They may also get the same disease and consequences as smokers. To sum up, cigarette smoking is really bad for our health. As a consequence, we should never smoke no matter what kind of conditions we are in. In addition, we are supposed to persuade our family accustomed to smoking to stop doing it.",B1
"Based on my opinion in Indonesia about the importance for students to work part-time Students have to learn because their parents are still responsible but they have different reasons Part time job could become an example of experience working on a part time job for students as students are less able to increase tuition fees and help the economy of such parents in Indonesia large number of unemployed and students can understand all because students can get the experience that a lot of examples for students working part-time advantage is to seek responsibility, adds to the cost of school, set the time management, until he could learn to adults and other whereas the impact of part-time work can interfere with him in time to learn, maybe a lot of tasks and the existence of extra-curricular My solution on a part time job for students should not be used, because he has the task to finish its work as a student and concentration with a lesson without thinking about work, because if he can finish his job as a student he can perform the following tasks and concentrate on the job will be undertaken after completing his duties as a student and also students can feel how wonderful the good times as a student.",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my answer. First, I think we don't need to smoke in a restaurant, because we go to there to enjoy good dishes not to smoke. Our purpose is not smoking. Second, I'd like to say that we can't enjoy tastes of dishes when we smoke, because smoke taste is really stronger than dishes. I think we can't have a good lunch or dinner even we go to a restaurant to enjoy dishes. Third, smoke is not good for health of the non-smoke people who come to a restaurant. Non-smoke people must breathe smoke when someone smokes in a restaurant even if non-smoke people don't hope it. Non-smoke people must lose their chances to have a good lunch or dinner because of smoking. And smoke is not good for our health and taste of dishes, especially for children of growing up. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Because we don't go to a restaurant to smoke, we can't enjoy dishes when smoke and smoke is not good health of non-smoke people especially for children.",A2
"I agree that smoking should be banned.. Because many people didn't smoke in the restaurants. People feel uncomfortable when they breathe. And it's bothering them. Can you imagine, when you are eating and there is someone besides you are smoking? It must be uncomfort right? So I agree that smoking must be prohibit in the restaurants. Sometimes there is a baby or a child in the restaurant, and they must caught because there is someone smoke in there. It's not good for their health. Smoking in the restaurants is selfish. Why don't go outside and smoking in the outside of the restaurants. Sometimes they don't think the impact of smoking in the restaurants. But it's not good for their health. not only for their health but also for people around them's heath. So, some restaurants have a smoking area to solve this problem. Where the smokers stay there to smoke. It is very efficient because the smokers stay with the smokers also. But some restaurants did not provides the smoking area. This is the problem then. If you disagree the statement above, you must make sure that all of restaurants in this country have a smoking area. And all of the people can feel comfort.",B1
"I don't agree that smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country because it is not fair for the people who are smoking. People who like smoking go to the restaurants but are banned to smoking. How they felt? Where they can go having a good meal? Another reason that I don't agree is the government doesn't bane people smoking. Because of that why can we completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The government allows that people keep smoking but want they don't smoke in the public. I don't think it's logic. It is just really unfair for me when thinking about people want smoking anywhere. Although smoking is really bad for people, you don't bane it completely; you can't bane people smoke in where they want. If you allow them to smoke, you have let them smoke everywhere. You make them don't smoke in the restaurants, and it is against the law of personal right. So I don't agree that be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I agree that should be completely banned smoking in the country. If every people don't smoke, the earth and people in the earth may become healthier. Our life may become clearer; it's not only in the restaurants.",B1
"Smoking should be banned in all public places in every country right now! The sooner the better because I work in the health care industry and I get to see first-hand, the affects of smoking and the damage that it causes. The number of deaths in New Zealand has risen sharply in the past two years and also the number of smoking related health issues. People are not forced to smoke, it is not compulsory and the number of deaths that it causes is completely preventable. All governments, including the Japanese Government are also aware of the medical statistics that show clearly that the death rate is climbing and illnesses caused by smoking, even passive smoking, are at an all time high. I fail to understand how any responsible government could allow this to continue and turn a blind eye or wait and see what the next survey/poll results are. It's disgusting that smoking is allowed in public eating places, polluting the very food that people are paying to eat. More and more non-smoking restaurants are popping up all over the place and we teach our children in school about the dangers of smoking, yet governments are reluctant to take a stronger position on this issue and just say no more. If a pack of cigarettes was filled with twenty terrorists or even suspected terrorists, how fast would governments act? To me, there is no difference to a pack of twenty smokes or a pack of twenty terrorists. They are all killers and a danger to the public.",C2
"Smoking has been a serious problem for too long a period. In the whole countries, measures have been carried to prohibit smoking in many public places, such as restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, I'm definitely in favor of this rule. What has been taken into consideration in this rule is first and foremost the health of people. Smoking has been criticized for decades. As is so often pointed out, smoking for a long time is likely to resulted in lung cancer. However, there are certain quantities of people who just cannot give up the ""terrific"" feeling of taking a cigarette, even though they are clearly aware that they are risking their health. It's not other people's business if they only smoke alone, but when they're smoking in public places, especially restaurants, more concerns should be taken in. Numerous statistic shows that ""second-hand"" smoking is more harmful than smoking directly. Therefore, when a person is enjoying his cigarette in restaurants, where people may not able to stay away the smoking immediately, s/he is putting the people around her/him into danger, including those who never lay their hands on the cigarette. So, it is reasonable to ban this behavior which is in no regard of other people. In the second place, the smog and smell produced by the cigarette may make people feel uncomfortable. Usually, a popular restaurant is crowded with people, which has already declined the quality of the atmosphere in these places. If the smog given out by cigarettes adds to it, many people can barely step enjoy their dishes. Besides, the smell is also not pleasant to those who don't smoke at all. Take myself as an example, I can't help sneezing even by a slight smell of the burning cigarette. It's definitely a catastrophe to me if I have to put up with the smog during my dinner. In conclusion, I'm fully convinced that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the countries.",B2

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because not only is smoking harmful to smokers themselves, it is also equally detrimental to second hand smokers in the restaurant. As most restaurants are indoor and air-conditioned, the smoke will be contained in an enclosed area. The smell of smoke would be overpowering in the restaurants and that would definitely put off the non- smokers who are dining there. Also, banning smoking at all restaurants in the country is a good way to show that the country emphasizes the importance of public health. This ban protects non-smokers from taking in second-hand smoke at public areas such as restaurants and minimizes the exposure. Smoking is known to bring about detrimental effects such as respiratory problems, increased chances of getting lung cancer and many other health issues. Banning smoking at restaurants reflects that the government wants to raise the awareness of smoking and discourage smokers. Additionally, smoking ban will help to increase the indoor air quality in the country and proper ventilation can be maintained. Even though the ban might result in loss of business in the restaurants, I believe that such a large-scale and nation-wide movement will allow the pros to outweigh the cons in the long run. ",B1

"I hate smokers. Smokers and its smoke are horrible. I do have my own reasons as the foundation from my opinion. I am a biotechnology student, and I know what is inside the cigarette itself. I am reluctant to imagine that smoke is entering my body and interrupt the whole system inside because cigarette smoke contains four thousand chemical compounds, 200 of them are poisonous which 43 of of them triggers cancer. There are two categories of secondhand smoke. First, the mainstream smoke, the smoke that comes out from the mouth of the smoker, after previously smoked and passed through the lungs of the smoker. Second, the sidestream smoke, the smoke that rises from the base of the cigarette before it is runs out. The toxic chemicals from the smoke of this type are more harmful than mainstream smoke. The sidestream smoke contains carbon monoxide five times greater than the mainstream smoke. Carbon monoxide itself, as we know, is a toxic gas that is quite effective in crippling the ability of blood to absorb oxygen. That's just one of many effects that can be caused by cigarette smoke for active and passive smokers. Imagine if you as non-smokers are affected because of irresponsible people who smoke selfishly. That is why smokers should be banned completely not only at the restaurant, but also in other public places.",B1
"We all know that cigarettes contain nicotine that makes smokers addicted in smoking. Even though they know that smoking is bad for their health they cannot resist the habit. Hence, I definitely agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants nationwide. The effect of second hand smoke is usually proliferative in the confined area like the restaurants. Smoking in limited space has a great effect in the body system of a person not only the smokers but also the people around the area. The health of an individual is compromise if smoking is allowed to practice in the restaurants as well as in the public places. Even the innocent people around the smoker inhaled the second hand smoke that gives worst effect in the body. Aside from this, the air that circulates inside the premises is not cleaned. Pollution is one of the biggest problems our world faces today. Smoking, being banned in all restaurants will lessen the pollution. It also helps our environment to become less polluted. Undoubtedly, smoking has a bad effect in the health of an individual either smoker or not develops many diseases. Besides, smoking in restrained area like restaurant does not give beneficial to the health of an individual. Banning the smoking is an excellent idea to lessen the pollution as well as to learn the smoker to control the habit of smoking in the public places.",B1

"About this topic, I think that it is not very important for college students to do part-time job. As we know, more college students tend to do a part-time job. Someone even has two or three. Though every coin has two sides, I believe that disadvantages of doing a part-time job outweigh its advantages. Some people guess that doing a part-time job can acquire many benefits, such as income, living experiments, etc. However, it pays us a large quantity of time and energy for the jobs. Doing jobs must be tired; it is not good for our health. In addition, colleges are the place where we learn knowledge. People usually believe that studying is the main task to students but not earning money. I really agree with it. Last but not least, doing part-time job can not earn a large number of money. Nevertheless, it cannot deny that we may be succeeding with lots of income in the future. Thus, knowledge plays an important role in our life. From what has been mentioned above, we can easily come to the conclusion that do part-time job is not a good choice to college students. We should focus more on study now.",A2
"Three reasons that we must not smoke The smoking has been a topic problem. Many people know that smoking is not good for us, but the number of smoking people is gradually increasing. The age of smoking is lower and lower than before. The problem of smoking is come to the fore. Therefore, I want to tell you why we must not smoke by three reasons. First of all, smoking increases the risk of cancer. As you know, the cancer of the lungs is the typical harm of smoking. Besides, the various cancers can also happen easily. Secondly, smoking is a cause of sterility. Nowadays, smoking rate of women is increasing gradually, so the rate of sterility by smoking is also increasing. The study found second-hand smoking is also a cause of the sterility. Third, smoking has many bad effects to children. Many fathers smoke at home, but smoking has bad effects to children's growth, respiratory organ and so on. Especially, It is the worst to the children who have atopy. Women's smoking rate is increasing gradually. Besides, the children's smoking rate is increasing too. We have to suggest ways about smoking problems. We must think that smoking increases cancer rates, sterility and children's health problems.",B1
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion a part time job in a college is very important for me because money from my mother, father or my aunt is not enough. There are many things I want to buy not only for my education in university degree but other thing also such as hanging out with my best friend, buy cosmetics, or shopping on my weekend because I want to be a fashionable. When your friend can buy everything that them want surely you are envy immediately, but you cannot do that. Why not? Because you are poor. So you find every way to have more money and part time job is one of your choices. Unfortunately some student find wrong way and do something wrong to get more money without care about moral and their family. Bad thing will not happen any more if you can manage your money and your thinking is significant also. Influent of money is not effect for you anymore.

"I don't agree Topic B. I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. What all student have to do is study hard. We pay university tuition at university in order to go university. But university tuition is expensive. Most of the students don't have a lot of money. So many students receive university tuition and living expenses from their parents. If students' parents do not have money for paying university tuition, students don't go university and take a class. Even they cannot see their friends. To go university, many students seek jobs. Or they drop out their university. If students have a part-time job day and night, they can't continue to take a class because they can't spent time in studying. All university students will lead to the world in the future. Many people said that ""If students don't have a lot of money for paying university tuition, they can receive scholarship in the university. "" But what many students receive scholarship is difficult. Because scholarship is little money than university tuition. We need to remember, a duty of all students is to study hard.

The trend of smoking is increases fastly. Different institutes have published the reports about health. In every country everyone have great prejudice against smoking. Smoking produces an excitement in our nervous system. Particularly a mentally and physically depressed man have desire to smoke. But smoking is effective our mind adversely. The people who are smoking and use drugs are always suffer from cough and cold. Due to smoking our eyesight and digestion are damaged. It weakness our will power and many people becomes heart patient. Against the smoking media have perform its responsibilities. In our society smoking is very common. Everywhere we see the people who have smoking mostly of them are chain smokers. Smoking is very common in every street. In restaurant we almost see the smokers. Due to smoking in restaurant vulgarity must be produced. In family restaurant the families are irritated due to smoking. Everyone dislike the smoking. Smoking is bad for every human. It damages the lungs. It is harmful for other with the smoker. Cigarette should must be banned in shops and in restaurant it should be banned.,B1
"I am strongly against smoking, so I agree with this proposition. This is especially so as restaurants are usually confined areas and there is a higher chance that second hand smoke would be inhaled. Studies show that second hand smoke causes more harm than the damage done to the smoker. Smoking is harmful but smokers tend to be overconfident that harm would only fall upon others, and not upon themselves. Restricting places where people can smoke may aid in discouraging the frequency of smoking, as well as discourage non smokers from picking up the habit. However, restricting smoking may harm business, especially for bars or restaurants that caters to the overnight crowd. Food and beverage business is a competitive industry in Singapore, and while the governmental bodies have been encouraging entrepreneurship, this may be a great blow to some businesses and reduce their already marginal profits. Fights may also ensue when owners try to stop customers from smoking. If this proposition is to be past as law, it is important that enforcement could be carried out smoothly and successfully. Hence, I would suggest that the proposition be changed to include only family friendly restaurants, and not all types of restaurants. ",B2
"For the question if part-time job is important for college students, my answer is it depends on their social status and decision of their parents. For those students that belong in high-class society, it is not necessary for them to take any part-time jobs. They will just finish their studies and work or manage their own family business. For middle-class like me, some take part-time job for their own allowance, to help their parents for the expenses but there are also parents who never let and will not allow their children to take part-time job because their reason is they want their children to focus in their studies then find a work after they graduated college. For students that really need to work for their tuition, allowance, book fees and other expenses in school and in their houses, it is important for them to have a part-time job to help them for their expenses and to help their parents who working so hard just to enroll their children in a great school. Having part-time job can help us be responsible, know how to budget money and having part-time job during college can build our character. We will know how much the value of the money that we get from our hardwork. We will know how and we will spend it in important things. Lastly, college students that have part-time job don't need to ask for money from their parents for their own needs and wants like a gadgets, clothes, and everything else and that are less burden for their parents.",B1
"Having a part-time job is important for college students. As a matter of fact, college students should be encouraged to have a part-time job in order to gain working experience and learn from a different environment. In college, the most important job for students is study and work hard to pass or to attain a better academic performance. However, under the circumstances of our education, it is rather hard to obtain certain skills and knowledge only in the campus. For example, most of the college students work as a server, because they can learn to socialize with strangers and practice problem-solving skills given that servers should deal with different kinds of customers every day and manage immediately the problems that might happen at any time. Being a student, we often accept information from professors rather than taking control of the courses. Having a part-time job will help us gain a sense of responsibility. The most common phenomenon for college student is being late for courses. When we have the pressure of a better performance on the job and of being an employer, we will be more mature and knowing what is right to do instead of escaping from responsibilities. As a result, college student should have a part-time job to learn to survive in the society, and by what we learn from the experience, we can perfect our lives and knowledge.",B2
"Smoking is should be banned all restaurants because of the harmful effect to our body that we breathe in. Also of its effect in the air that creates air pollution due to smoke that has no good affect at all. For those who are addict in smoking therefore should be in all restaurants they have a policy that there are place that smoking is restricted and place where they can smoke so that people who are eating do not destructed by the smoke. In all the country I think it is more important that banning the cigarettes makes more people to live long life than this 20th century who have the most number of smokers that kills more people and cannot expand their lives in the age of 50+. In case of restaurants banning is not so effective to stop the smokers because they'll find way to smoke after they eat because it is their habit but if cigarettes is absence in the restaurants, definitely few customer will arrive because most of the customer smoke and free smoke in restaurants if few and countable because it is also their assets to engaging in business and to find ways how to earn more money.",B1
"A part-time job is a good way for a student to learn many things that they simply cannot learn in a classroom. For example, by having a part-time job, I was able to learn about how to manage my own money and how to plan my finances for the entire month so that I know how much I need to make for rent and for food as well as for other expenses like entertainment. Also, I feel that I've become more responsible as a result of working part time because it has taught me how to manage my time and taught me how to prioritize my tasks in order to complete them in the most efficient way I can. This is a good skill that I simply did not develop well from college alone, so for students like me that need some extra ways in which to learn, part-time work is great because a can help you see the world from a new perspective and help you approach the same issues from different ways that will help you learn a skill that you needed to but couldn't previously. In conclusion, I think that having a part-time job is a great way for students to learn things that they may not have encountered if they stick only to studying for their classes.",C2

"Excellent idea! How soon can it be set up? Honestly, I'm surprised that it has taken this long for Japan to consider this ban. Smoking related deaths and sicknesses in Japan are increasing, not decreasing and the number of illnesses that can be attributed to passive smoking, are also on the rise. While I guess that there might be a huge backlash at first, people would adopt the idea soon enough and a ban can only help the health situation in the long run. Too bad if the smokers disagree because really, no one is telling them not to smoke, just where they are not allowed to smoke which seems perfectly OK to me. Why should others be inconvenienced or be put at risk if they don't want to suck in secondhand smoke? If people are working near inflammable substances and there are smoking restrictions in place, nobody seems to mind and everybody understands readily enough. For me, it just makes perfect sense to do the same thing in restaurants and public places because chemicals from smokes can kill and cause disease which makes it high risk just to go to a restaurant and eat out. Let's make the world a safer place to live in and start by cleaning up the air that we breathe.",C2

College students that have a part-time job, will be fun because they use their free time to make them and get friends. Especially for summer, it is so long time to have a part-time job and many companies are interested with this. And it helps their family to save money. Such as job of service that is popular job for college students because it is easy and many positions. College students that have a part-time job, will increase experience in social, team work. Such as, in KFC, everybody needs their duty, manages their time for work and plans their money for everytime. That is a way to leader of social. Working be team is basic of human lifestyle. People need social, talking, learning and cheering. These show communication, colorful of life, really important for life. A part-time job is so important for life of college students. One person has a past-time job for many reasons. So, the college students can't miss it.",B1
"College students are those who study in college. Generally, they still depend on their parents for their living. But, not all of them like that way of living. Some of them want to earn money by themselves. That is because modern lifestyle nowadays requires quite some amount of money. And sometimes, the money their parents send is not enough. On the other way, there are some college students who want to live independently, so they do not have to depend on their parents, like, forever. So they try to earn money by themselves. Some college students want to experience how to work in the future, when they graduated from college. One of the ways is to do a part time job. A part time job does not require too much time, but they still can earn some money to buy their needs and get the experience of working with other people, so they can get some training too. They can learn how to manage their time more appropriately, because they have to do their assignments and study for tests too. The other benefit is they can learn how to manage their own money. If they spend it wisely, they will have more money at the end, and they can have their own savings. That is why a part time job is important for college students.",B1
"Some people think that ban on smoking at all the restaurants is bad. But I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons why I think so: other people's health, bad smell and clear environment of restaurants. First of all, other people's health is very important. But, if some smoker smokes at food restaurants, other people's health can be bad. Especially, if there are pregnant women, the old and babies, it can be very harmful to them. Second, people get angry if they smell bad smoke. Cigarette's smells very bad and it can make people feel unpleased. The people have a right to breathe good smell at food restaurant. Third, if heavy smokers smoke at food restaurants, the restaurant's environment can be dirty. The tobacco smoke can go into the food and the remains of cigarette can go into the food. Also, the food restaurants' furniture will be dirty because of cigarette. So, because of the three reasons, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I agree because, first part time job make you spend your free time in the right way. Somebody kill their time by go shopping or traveling all of activity lose your time but if you get the job in the shop or restaurant. That's earning your money. Second it can improve your skill if you only meet the small social and have no accommodate so the job would help you to meet new many kinds of people that's might be good for you. Third it's improved your patient and can make you grow up; the job sometime might be hard or not comfortable; if you can pass it that would be great. Fourth you are in the college that's mean you are not the little child. The part time job can help you parent and you would be proud to your self that you can earn your pocket money by your two hands but in other word your mother would not reprove you any more about your new shirt or new shoes. And the last reason some learner have not much time to have an exercise so do the job would help you to move your body and use your brain the result is your health is good. I think it is the good way to spend your time on past time job and don't forget to study hard too.",B1
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because having a part-time job will enable a student to experience what real life is like, and not be molly-coddled in the safe academic world. The point of going to college is to get an education, while academic knowledge is important, street smarts should not be neglected too. A part-time job is a good way for students to be more sophisticated about how the world works. Part-time jobs let the students earn pocket money too, which is a good way for students to learn about finance and also, lessen the financial burden on parents. Therefore, with the two main benefits explained above, gaining more experience about the world and earning pocket money at the same time, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, the statement is not clear whether it is important for students to have a part-time job at all times or just sometimes. The latter position makes more sense. While having a job will no doubt benefit a student in terms of expanding his or her horizons, the basic duty of a student is still to academics. Hence it is better if the student only works at a part-time job during school holidays and the less-busy time of school, but focus on studies during exams. ",B2
"College life is full of colorful activities. There are many alternative choices for college student to arrange their schedule. Though studying is still one of our necessary assignments, most college students hold the point of view that it is also important for them to take a part-time job. As a saying goes Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. College is thought to be a bridge combines the school with society. We are facing to work after our graduation. First of all, we may learn much more knowledge and accumulate social experience from the part-time job out of the book. Besides, taking part-time job can improve our social skills. Once we walk into society, we have to build relationship with different people. So during the part-time job, we may have suffered a lot of social problem. What's more, we can make more friends during the work. Many friends of mine have taken part-time jobs, such as waiter, postman, tutor, etc. They are all excited about their work. My roommate Amy told me in a high spirit when I interview her about part-time job. She said, I've ever been an English tutor for a half year when I was a freshman. I took a bus to the family once a week. The day before the work, I spend a whole night to make full preparations. My student Jim was a cute boy and his parents were friendly to me. Not only can I review my English, but also I get my own paid every week. It was a satisfying job. If time permits, I suggest college students taking some part-time job. And you will benefit much from it!",B1
"Today, many college students have part-time jobs. Some people think that a part-time job is important to college students because they think is essential part of the campus life and do good to our future. The other think that part-time job waste our times. Well, in my opinion, I don't think part-time job is important to us. I have two reasons. First, as a college student, our main duty is study. We only have 24 hours a day, we only have about 30 days a month, we only have 12 month a year, We only have 4 years in college. So time is precious, time is important to us. If we spend much time in doing part-time job, we have no time to study, that's not good. When we graduate from college, we may be too busy to study. So we should pay more attention to study, not part-time job. Second, as a college student, there is a little chance to have a meaningful part-time job. Think about it, you go to find a job such like waiter. This job has no relationship with the knowledge we learn. They do this job just for money. That's not a good phenomenon because we only can learn little thing from the job. Although part-time job has some advantages for us such like help us know this society and help us gain some work experience. But as a saying goes do right thing in right time. As a college student, we should put study at first part of our lives. So I think it's not important for us to have a part-time job.",B1
"These days, a lot of students have part-time jobs. On the Internet and newspapers, many companies are looking for students to work for them. I don't think, however, it is a good idea for students to work part-time while they are going to school. I also don't think it is necessary, because parents support them and pay for their expenses. In addition, having jobs has some negative effects. First of all, education is difficult and complex. To learn and get good grades, students have to study hard. They have to get up early to attend classes, and do their homework at home. It seems to be easy, but it is busy and hard. If students are working part-time after class, they are going to be tired, so it impacts on the next day. It will have negative effects on studying: they won't concentrate, and they will even be able to doze in class. Finally, it will impact on their grades. Next, having part-time jobs interrupts a student's home life. Nowadays, family time tends to decrease. In addition, having work incites this phenomenon. For example, if a student has work after school, he can't have dinner with family. It means that students don't have enough time to spend with families. Finally, if a student works part-time, he may miss out on the fun of his life. He won't be able to play with his friends and enjoy his own spare time. In other words, if a student spends time on working, he can't enjoy his life. I think that a period of students is the freest time except studying. This is because their parents pay for their expenses, and parents help everything that they want. Therefore, students have to concentrate on studying. In conclusion, students' duty is studying. They have to study rather than work because having part-time jobs has some negative effects as above.",B1
"I agree because they can learn some basic financial skills such as budgeting, get some organisational skills and generally get to know what it is like to have to go to work. The big thing for me when I was working and studying was that I learned that I had to be responsible but more importantly, act responsibly. I could not just take off and go to parties with my mates when I felt like it. I did have some trouble with time management at first, but after my first few stuff ups, I managed to get it right, for the most part anyway. I was given no slack from my lecturers either although my boss was pretty good to me. I hear a lot of kids complaining and crying about how tough it is and I always think that they have no idea what tough is. My idea of tough is living in Afghanistan or Iraq or even Africa where people are shooting at you or you are dying from hunger. Now that is doing it tough in my opinion not working part-time and then sitting in an air-conditioned room at university or college with a fast food cafeteria downstairs. But then, I guess it is all subjective to our own experiences and opinions.",C2
"Everyone know that smoking is bad for their health. So why is someone still smokes? Well, probably because they think that smoking is smart or it can make them relax. In case of restaurant, Does smoking must be banned ? It's extremely sure! The restaurant is a place that many people come to have a breakfast, a lunch or a dinner. They can be cute baby, smart boy, beautiful woman or old grandfather. Surely that they don't want to be harm from smoking. Everyone don't want to be close to a person who is smoking, because it has a bad smell and it is bad for their health. But, how can we do if they really want to smoke? Well, you can build a private room that used for smoking. You can decorate the room with anything that will be beautiful. This room must be far away from people that come to have a meal and it must be far away from the toilet too. May be this is the best way for them. Smoking doesn't give you any benefit. It doesn't give you only a bad health, but it will waste your money too. So, you must not smoke!",B1
"I agree this statement. Because restaurant is place where people eat food. Smoker can smoke other place except restaurants. So, smoking in restaurant is should be banned. I don't smoke now sure. And, I won't smoke. Smoking is very bud for our body sure. But, it is good taste for us. So, we can't patient smoke. And, I claim that smoking should be banned in all public places. Sure, people who are smoking have power that they can smoke. But, people who are not smoking have also power that they can avoid bud smoke. Setting boundary line is difficult. All people wished that they want to be comfortable. Smoker must patient their dream that they can smoke everywhere for that. And, smoking is very bud for our body I said again. So, all people should stop smoking. If nothing smoke in the world, everyone is comfortable. But it is only dream. So, smoker should have manner in the least. I and people who are not smoking wish that public place contain restaurants is all banned smoking. It never is that we are all comfortable. But more people is careful, more people is comfortable. We should act for public. We should act for other people",B2
"I think this statement is very good for many people. I think we should not smoke at restaurant. Because some people don't like smoke. There are many kinds of people and families with children at restaurant. Smoking make many people get uncomfortable. I think smoke have us don't taste and smell food. It is no means to eat and impolite for cooks. However, some kinds of people want to smoke at any place, only restaurant. They don't have any bad feelings for people who don't smoke. So I would like to both groups have good times. Recently, smoking area separates non-smoking area in many restaurants. But some smoke come non-smoking area. In this way, it is no means to separate. It is admitted to smoke at some restaurants, strong air conditioner should be had in them to remove smoke and change air. So I think we should separate smoking and non-smoking area completely. For example, to make two flours or to build two buildings. But they are very costly and it needs wide ground. It is difficult to realize. It is the easiest way that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. But I want to find better way for both groups.",A2
"I agree because it gives students several opportunities. First and foremost, I believe that it gives students responsibilities and obligations that must be met. Then let's not forget that they are also getting real job experience. With the job experience makes money and also any additional job skills that are necessary to perform their tasks. What usually carries over into college is that they learn to prioritize their workloads, organize their studies so that they may assimilate information in a more orderly and easier to remember process. Unless they are stressed out, their ability to focus is usually more heightened and they tend to maximize their time more efficiently. When they leave college and their part-time jobs, they usually do so having acquired not just learning skills or information, but tools and techniques that will carry them in good stead regardless of what job they get. If by chance they should find themselves in between jobs, they may be able to seek different kinds of work that their skills base may be transferred to. We know that many skills are transferable and see this in the business world quite frequently so this should be no different in a newly graduated student's case.",C2
"I agree totally with this statement, as I believe that the society will benefit from this movement if it is implemented. It has already been widely recognised that smoking, both direct and second-hand, has dire effects on an individual's health. Such impacts will also result in high social cost for the society in general in the forms of lower productivity and less healthy populations with higher incidences of lungs-related diseases, which will then warrant higher need and urgency to divert national budgets towards healthcare treatment from other equally important sectors like education and nation building. The urgency for its implementation is especially emphasized in the context of the restaurants, where family outings are usually conducted. Children are widely known to have a weaker immune system, and hence are more susceptible to the harmful effects of second-hand smoking. Yet given the addictive nature of smoking, I do not deny the possibility that this movement might face some objections from the smokers themselves. However, I still opine that Singapore will only benefit from the banning of smoking in its ground in the long term as smoking is too much a negative externalities to its economy and society as large. Moreover, quitting smoking will also improve the lifestyles and health of its population which can then free up extra resources for other important sectors in Singapore that we would like to develop on. No doubt this will be a long-term measure, but restaurants are a good starting point for this movement. ",B1
"I don't like smoking. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, it is true that smoking gives serious damage not only a person who smoke but also a person who is near from his or her. People who smoke get lung cancer than people who don't smoke. Second, I think the most serious problem is smoking at the restaurant make people who don't smoke feel very uncomfortable. Break fast, lunch, and dinner is the time that all of the people enjoy eating and relax. And a restaurant is the place where people enjoy eating and relax. At the same time, however, a restaurant is not the private place but the public place. Perhaps some people relax when they smoke. But I think smoking in a restaurant is bad manner. To enjoy eating all of the people, each person should stop smoking. So all the restaurants should make a rule that bans smoking. If people want to smoke, they should go outside and enjoy smoking. These days smoking banned day by day. I think it is good moving for all of the people to make comfortable environment and good health.",A2
"In today's society, more and more college students have part time job after school. In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time. I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. We will also have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help teenagers find their ideal job more easily in the future. And the teenagers can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in their future working circumstance. Teenagers can also expand their interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I have read an article; it said, Without friends, we will not do anything perfectly. Interpersonal relationship is really very important in our working place. In summary, perhaps many people will think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help teenagers ' future become much better, no matter in the attitude toward money, in getting working experiences, or in interpersonal relationship.",A2
"Smoking was practiced by Native Americans in both North and South America as far back as 100 A. D. Tobacco was originally used by these people in religious ceremonies, but later it became common to smoke for pleasure. Cigars are also rolled in tobacco leaves while cigarettes are rolled in paper. The leaves used to roll cigars must be thin, smooth, and of good color for the best cigar. According to the study, chewing tobacco increased the risk of heart attack two-fold and smokers had a three-fold increased risk of a heart attack compared to people who had never smoked hate smoking. I don't understanding smoker. They are why smoking. Smoking is very bad thing. Smoking is hazardous to your health. It certainly wasn't worth the money we paid to see it. I hope to government outlawed smoking in all public buildings and street. I want high taxes have recently been imposed on cigarettes. Many smokers are remembering informant fact. Don't forget active smokers are passive smokers too. It's very disgusting and stressful. Hang out with people who don't smoke. I don't really understand any person who smokes. I can't stand it when people smoke as they walk down the street. The air is already polluted, so I don't understand why people want to smoke",A2
"As is known to us all, many college students choose to take a part-time job in their spare time and this is a common phenomenon in our life. But here we need to talk about whether part-time job could actually do good to our college students. As far as I am concerned, I believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. First of all, when we take a job, we could get a chance to learn to be independent. In the same time, we can use this chance to try to get along with others. What is more, as result, we can also get our financial reward and work experience as well which may be helpful in our future life. Furthermore, to take a part-time job provides us with an important opportunity to put what we have learnt from books into practice. However, every coin has two sides. There are also some disadvantages. Firstly, some students may spend a lot of time doing part-time jobs so that they just neglect their studies and this will affect their studies as a result. Secondly, some students may be cheated by others, because they don't know how to take good care of themselves and how to distinguish between right and wrong. In a word, I agree that students should try to get a part-time job which could help them to know something about society, but they should keep a balance between job and study.",B1
"The discussion with my partner gave a valuable result. We were in the same way that government should ban smoking in the restaurant. The reason is very clear. we all know that smoking has a bad effect for smoker itself and for the passive smoker. Therefore, it is the government's responsibility to decrease smoking activities through the program of forbidding to smoke especially in public area. Restaurant is one of public area that should be enjoyable, comfortable and safe for the customers or visitors. When someone smokes other people will be disturbed. In addition Indonesian people have a bad behavior. They will smoke after having meal. They will not be relaxed if they don't smoke after having a meal. So, the people, especially men, mostly smoke when they are in a restaurant. It will possibly disturb other people. In this case, restaurant have a big advantages especially for smokers that usually like getting together with their partners by having some meals and beverages. When they have a spare time, they will set an appointment to go to a restaurant (for example) and then have a chat. At this time, they often smoke in there. It's a common behavior. Therefore we can not let it happen it will reduce the comfort of the restaurant.",B1
"I think part-time job is very important in some students. Because they are very poor. So some students will have to pay expensive fees earned directly. For this reason, it is very important for campus students. If part-time job not, because they can't afford to pay the tuition fees. Other students that doing part-time job spend to buy clothes or to play with friends. Know the importance of money and can spend some free time more interesting. And while part-time jobs are also usually experience social advance. So I think it is important to campus students. But many people say'it does not important. 'They say, rather I get a scholarship to study and better.... Of course, if I can get scholarships, good grades, but it is not easy to do, and you can study while working part-time enough to think we can get a scholarship. Of course, I think a part-time job is to decide for you. And when they do not work part-time for any reason. They are also a part-time job is its own reason. Paying tuition, Savings money or buying clothes, etc. Because of these good things, I think you need a part-time college students are. So I agree on this topic.",B1
"Smoking is a common thing in most restaurants and other public places but should it be completely banned at all restaurants in the country? It must be banned in all restaurants because health and smoking is hazardous to other person's health, it is harmful to a pregnant and it discolours walls. In the first place, smoking is bad to other person's health. Second-hand smoke can shorten a person's life span. It causes cancers and respiratory diseases both to children and adults. Second-hand smoke has more toxic chemicals and has a higher possibility of causing cancer than the smoke a person inhales himself. In the second place, it is bad for pregnant. Smoking causes a bad effect to the woman's unborn child. If the woman inhales others smoke, she can pass the toxic chemicals that smoke carries and unwanted diseases to the unborn child. Lastly, smoking can damage the walls of the restaurant. Smoking contains toxic chemicals that can discolour the walls of the restaurant. The restaurant must look admirable to attract customers. If the walls are discoloured, it could be an added expense to the owner of the restaurant because the owner should repair the damage wall. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants because of many different reasons. Smoking can cause hazardous effects to other person's health, It is harmful to a woman's unborn child and it is destroys the walls of the restaurant. Smoking is addictive and a lot of smokers cannot stop it. Smokers should know where the right place to smoke but restaurants is definitely not the place.",B1
"One thing I know is smoking does not do anything good to a man's body and even to the environment. Millions of people die because of different illness caused by smoking. There's lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and many other serious illnesses that can cause one's death. Stating these facts, many people still engage themselves in smoking. That's why some countries banned smoking in public places. Smoking in public places especially in restaurants is definitely a NO, NO. One, it is surrounded by many people and they may acquire second-hand smoke. Next is, there may be children in that place and it is not a good example seeing elderly smoking in front of them. Smoker might reason that they need to smoke after they eat so they can avoid having gastritis. Restaurant is a place where people eat and not for smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from fume and smell. It's not good for people to smell smoke because scientist and doctors says it is more dangerous that if you inhale a smoke from the smoke inhaled by another person, which is called second-hand smoke. It is said that non-smokers exposed in second-hand smoke increase their risk of lung cancer. The government of the Philippines starts banning smoking in public places. In my own opinion, smoking must be banned in restaurants and even in other public places because it affects people's health even those who are not smoking. But this will also affect the democracy of the country, people's right to choose and do whatever they want as long as they're responsible for what they're doing. But above all these, banning of smoking should start in our home. Parents should be the first one who will lecture their children that smoking is not a good practice.",B1
"Should we ban smoking at all restaurants? No, of course. First of all, we all know that smoking is unhealthy. But why so many people like taking cigarettes? Because they are in addiction. If we ban smoking in everywhere, no people can take cigarettes. The air quality can be improved. Moreover, less students will simulate the others to start taking cigarettes. However, people may forget to consider one fundamental flaw in the argument. Certainly, no one can deny that official forum, there is no conclusive corroboration to support the argument. Most bars are ignore this suggestion. What is more, people disgust this suggestion. This suggest are not effective. Finally, we should consider one alarming adverse effect of the scheme. The government does not allow people to bring more than 19 cigarettes back to Hong Kong. This suggestion will lead the existence of illegal cigarettes are more serious than ever. Also, customer should leave the restaurant when they need to take cigarettes. It is very troublesome. Therefore, we should have second thoughts about the argument smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. This is NOT the best policy. It is beyond dispute that recent debates have aroused much public attention to the matter of the suggestion. Personally, I agree that the idea of smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants brings more harm than good. It is my opinion that the suggestion is a destructive view.",B1
"It is important for college students to have a part time job. With the development of society, we, college students, should do more to adjust it. And having a part time job is a good way to improve our ability. University is a place which can give you a lot freedom. And you can choose to do what you want to. But we still should have a plan for our future. We should strength the ability of communicate and so on. The part time job gives us a chance to improve. So it is important for college students to have a part time job. It gives us a chance to touch the society, to learn about company and know more about people. On the other hand, part time jobs also can help a lot of students whose families are not very well. It may relieve their parents' economic burdens, and solve many problems. Nowadays, more and more college students forget their aim and lost their direction. Part time jobs give such a chance to make their lives clear. This encourages us to do more plan for our future. So in my opinion, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. And it has a good sense.",B1
"Now the quantity of smoker, especially smoker of adult always growing. This condition is serious defiance for effort to improve status of public health. The habit of smoke increase the risk of various disease such as heart disease, lung cancer, impotence, high blood pressure and other. Cigarette smoke also dangerous for non smokers that around of smokers. Once a person becomes a smoker, would be difficult to end this habit, either physical or psychological. Because the addictive nature (make someone become addicted) cigarette. Many people know about dangers of smoking, but not many who are concerned about the dangers of smoking. The warning on every pack of cigarettes apparently not enough to represent the disease that threaten the smokers. The climate not smoking must be created. This is should be implements simultaneously by all of us, who wants to achievement of the Indonesian nation state and a healthy and prosperous. Smoking cessation efforts should be the duties and responsibilities of all levels of society. Business information an counseling, especially among the younger generation, also can be associated with narcotics hazard mitigation efforts, the business school health, and general of public health education. The community role model figures, including officials, religious leaders, teacher, health workers, artists, , it is fitting to set an example by not smoking. It should also limit the opportunity to smoke in public places, and workplace; regulation and control of cigarette promotional advertising; post the health warnings on cigarette packs and cigarette advertising. For the prevention of smoking habits in children and adolescents. Parents and teachers play a major role to supervise, provide correct information and most importantly do not become an example of behavior of individuals who are addicted to smoking habits.",A2
"In most modern colleges, academic pursuits and achievements alone do not meet the goal of a holistic education. Other than co-curricular activities, internships and community involvements, the part-time job seems to be one of the ways for college students to pick up or practice skills beyond the classroom. The part-time job can be seen to be a sort of a school of hard knocks, where students get a taste of the working world by regularly embracing volatility and adapting to new situations. It also provides a side income to students. However, a part-time job does not appear to be of such importance when we consider well-off students who do not require the additional income. Students may also wish to focus on their studies in the school term, and only turn to short-term jobs in their vacation instead of struggling to juggle both work and studies simultaneously. In other cases, students may find that the opportunity cost of taking up a part-time job is too high, especially if the time can be spent on an internship that is of greater relevance and potential benefit to the mastery of his or her major. Some exceptions are however acknowledged. In times when a student faces financial distress and finds difficulty in covering college tuition fees and basic living expenses, this necessitates a source of income. It is financially wise to grow capacity before budgeting, and one of the ways for the college student to do so is to hold a part-time job. In this situation, a part-time job is a necessity, and its importance ranks equally high or even higher than other priorities of the student. ",B2
"Today, I want to talk about this topic as the affirmative side. First of all, what is the part-time job for the college students? I think it's the good opportunity to touch our society before we go out the society. From that, they can get the skill, for example, communication with their customer, cooking, or how to teach something to someone and so on. Moreover we can actually feel social situation, and know the significance of earning money. However some people said that students have to work hard and late, and the environment in their workplace sometimes bad, for example smoking, drinking or something like that. So they disagree this topic because the part-time job will be obstacle for students to study. Surely the main thing for the college students is studying in their college days. I admit this point. But I believe it doesn't mean all students have to do is only such thing. After the graduation and going out the society, we need not only knowledge we can get in universities but also other skill. Only knowledge it's not enough. When you work in your company, you must negotiate with your clients, and keep the good relationship with your colleague. Such skill can't get from only universities. If we can get the basis of such skills during universities, we can quickly fit our society when we start working. So to compare advantages and disadvantages, I believe the part-time job is important for college students as the preparation for working actually in our society.",B1
"Although smoking is an unhealthy living habit and many people see it as a social cancer which threats both the smokers themselves and other people's health, banning smoking in all the restaurants is quite unnecessary and irrational. On one hand, if this practice targets at encouraging more and more smokers to quit smoking, that would be too strict. Quit smoking is a long and bitter process, it's impossible for those smokers to make it overnight, banning smoking in restaurants makes their life not convenient and may hurt their feelings because I think restaurants should be a place to relax, where many people ease their pressure by enjoying smoking. On the other hand, if restaurants aim at protecting other costumers' health, complete banning on smoking is not necessary at all. Like the minority of restaurants in the world, we can separate smokers from ordinary costumers and place them in an independent kitchen. To conclude, although smoking is not welcomed in public places, we can make it too strict. However, we can set some rules to limit them, but not totally ban smoking.",B1
"Smoking has been a serious social problem for a long time. In our country, several millions of people smoke every day. What is worse, everyone on the earth suffers the air pollution. We should take immediate measures to forbid the smoking before our earth is destroyed thoroughly. Every day, a large amount of people have died of lung cancer because they smoked a lot when they lived. As we all know, smoking kills our health gradually so that our bodies become weaker and every organ come down until we can not breathe and walk. Smoking is such a horrible killer that we can't see. Smoke is not only harmful to person, but also plays a much worse effect on our environment. When one person is smoking, people around him will have the second-hand smoke at the same time, which can leads to serious disease like cancer. On the other hand, smoke contributes to the greenhouse effect which makes our earth become hotter and weather is changeable. Maybe it seems to make no matter as we see today, but in 10 years, we must regret and can only cry to hate ourselves. Look the dying people, look the declining animal series, and look the grey environment. I strongly propose that we mustn't smoke any more.",B1
"I think that it is a shame that so many people feel they have the right to impose their opinions on others. The more rules we have placed on our behavior the less free we are, and I think it is common knowledge that both the United States and Japan are free countries. Citizens should be able to do as they please as long as this does not interfere with others. This situation is very similar to the people trying to ban guns. Most owners and users of guns are very responsible people who are properly trained in the use of guns, but there are a few bad people who are ruining it for us all. It seems that there are some very inconsiderate smokers out there who aren't doing much to help nonsmokers be accepting of their habit and may be doing so by smoking in restaurants and other public places. If smoking was banned in restaurants and restaurants in Japan I don't think it would be a huge deal because they can always still smoke outside. The thing that worries me is that the next step will be to ban smoking outside as well and this would truly be a breach of civic freedom.",C2
"To smoked in the restaurant? Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think agree. Smoking has to ban in the entire restaurant. Because smoking is harmful any people. People is happy to eat food in the restaurant, but if have a one guy to smoky. I think any people are very unhappy. It is very not politeness. I think have to a rule to do in the country. If have a rule can let people know smoking is wrong in the restaurant. So I think should a rule in the restaurant. I think can to reduce very bad exemp for child. The public place is every people have to do. Many people don't like smoke taste. To smoke is very bad especially for child and student. To smoke is a very bad exemp. So we can't to learn this bad to be used smoking. If I also don't like to smoke. Because smoking maybe let our health is bad. If you go to see in the hospital. You should know to pay attention your health everyday. So everyone can't to smoke in the public place not only in the restaurant. We should know this rule. It is not to cause the other people.",A2
"We have got to know about harms of smoking recently, because many media report it. According to them, there are various harms. For example, smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer. Another example, when the woman during pregnancy smokes, the embryo receives a bad manner. And, in addition, smoking decreases in moving ability and the skin grows old. Smoking after one agrees to these harms is individual freedom and we don't have any right to get them to quit smoking. But in places that an unspecified number of people gather in such as restaurant, it is necessary to prohibit smoking. Because, as we have already know, those who breathe the smoke that rises up from the top of cigarette suffer more serious harm than those who smoke actually. It is what is called passive smoking. If people smoke and injure their health, they have no one but themselves to blame, but it is ridiculous of people who don't actually to receive the harms. And restaurant is the place to enjoy dishes. So it is problem that the good smell of dishes which chefs made with their whole heart is deaden by the smoke of cigarette. It is bad manner to chefs and dishes. In brief, by prohibiting smoking, more people are able to have a good time in restaurant. This is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.",B1
"Smoking is a habituation for some of people. A part of people say this habituation is bad. In fact the smoker in the world is not a little number. I completely agree with the statement of smoking should be banned in the restaurant, because restaurant is a general place for people. Why should be banned? Smoking make a pollute and make the concentration of air will be dirty by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Both of them and the other concentration included in cigarettes also make our respiratory system will be broken, especially for our lungs. We know that smoking is not only bad for the active smoker, but also for the passive smoker too. We will get in disease in our respiratory system. One of the diseases is cancer. In the restaurant, automatically people need nice services. If the owner let the smoker to smoke their cigarettes there, it will be make the other customers complain. A part of people who have asthma, will disturbed their breathes. In other side, we also have the some negative effects. People who have smoking habituation will be unfreedomly to smoke in this restaurant too and that iss limited their place to smoke's area. It is fine if the other people have different comments and it does not matter if they want to smoke in the restaurant, but it is better if the owner of the restaurant give a special room for the smoker.",B1
"I am a smoker. When I was nine teen years old, I took tobacco from my father's pants. That time, I just felt curiosity about tobacco. So I smoke heavily from then on. I got caught smoking in the restroom by my mother. My mother was very surprised. She told me ""quit smoking"" but I couldn't control my patience. So I became a smoker. I tried to smoke myself into composure. Smoking is very bad for body and nonsmoker. Although I know this fact, I smoke without a break. When I was 21years old, I could stop smoking because I entered the army. Just 30 days, I couldn't buy tobacco, so I could cut smoking forcibly. That time, a few days after giving up smoking, I started to suffer from withdrawal symptoms. But 30 days after, I went to furlough, I started smoking again. For this reason, I couldn't control myself. I think my patience is very poor. Above all things, if you cut the smoking, you need to learn to be more patient. Lacking in patience people never succeed in quit smoking. Here are some method raise your patients. First, eat candy instead of smoking time. Second, when do you feel withdrawal symptoms, let's do exercise!! These are so subjective. But many of people that use this method when they feel withdrawal symptoms. Do your best for stopping smoke. I hope that you feel better soon.",B1
"Personally, it's important for college students to take a part-time job. One reason is that college students are not as busy as middle school students. They have more leisure time. Perhaps some students don't know what to do or they may be addicted to the computer games. They just don't how to use the leisure time. So taking a part-time job can make them feel a little more comfortable and help them make the leisure time more useful. Taking a part-time job also has many other advantages. The one who take a part-time job can gain more experience on getting along well with others. They can also make more friends easily. All these can help them become more acceptable when they seek for a job after graduating. So having a part-time job can help students be ready for the future work. Another advantage is so important that can't be ignored. Taking a part-time job can get more money. This advantage may be the first concern of the students. Someone thinks that making money can make them be independent from their parents. And they also have money to buy what they have dreamed for a long time. Concerning about the advantage to take a part-time job, it's important for college students to take a part-time job.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, and there three reasons to show that I agree with. First, smoking harms your health because if you smoke, you will be a cancer or other diseases that will make you die more quick than people who do not smoke. Second, if you smoke in the restaurants, it will disturb of harm other people who want to go to have a good meal with their family or their lover and don't smoke. I think you will kill people even though you do not want to kill or destroy them. Third, smoking will destroy the atmosphere in the restaurant; you have to think that if you go to the restaurant what you really want to do ""eat"" that is the purpose when you go to the restaurant, so if you want to smoke at the restaurant, you should not go because you will destroy the atmosphere of eating at the restaurants where people use for enjoy eating. For the reasons that are smoking destroys your health, harms other people who do not smoke, and makes a bad atmosphere at the restaurants, so you must not smoke at all restaurant anyway.",B1
" Recently, many countries put forward the policies of banning the smoking in public places, which means the government begins to put much attention on this problem. In my opinion, this banner is beneficial to the citizens' health. And we all should protect this pure environment from the harm of smoking. As we all know, smoking does a great harm to lung, and will raise the rate to have cancer disease. So no matter where should we smoke and do harm to ourselves. Not only can smoking do harm to smokers, but also the second-hand smoke can be harmful to the people staying at the public places, because the second-hand smoke can cause a large influence on our body. If a child is on the scene, the damage to his little body is even larger. It may lead to a malformation! So how can we endure a person in a public place like restaurant smoking without any misgiving? Last but not the least, the pollution of cigarettes is also one reason why we should ban smoking. Regardless of the process or the result, the pollution is both large. When we get the step to protect the environment and advocate green-products, this problem must be handled as soon as possible. After the statements, we can see the importance to ban smoking in public places! Let us pay more emphasis on the problem.",B1
"Most people are still working even though they know it will be bad for their health. Unfortunately, not only the active smokers but also the passive smokers will receive the negative effects of smoking. This is the main reason why smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Both active and passive smokers share the same deathly risks, including, but not limited to stroke, heart disease, brain damage, and cancer. These passive smokers would be saved from these deadly issues by not allowing people to smoke at all restaurants. It can also disrupt human respiratory system by inhaling the smokers. Besides, there are bad impressions about smokers. their teeth are stained, their gums are rotted, and the odors of smokers are unpleasant. These conditions discomfort the passive smokers. As an example, a passive smoker like me would prefer to eat in the non-smoking section at any restaurants. Non-smoking sections are usually cleaner than smoking sections. Smoking section contains smokers and tobaccos ashes which will discomfort me. It would be better if there is a rule that banned smoking actively at all restaurants rather than creasing a smoking and non-smoking sections. Since there are many passive smokers at al restaurants, smoking should be banned.",B1
"I think that most people would agree that having a part-time job is a good option for a student. I've had a part-time job since my first semester of college and I have learned a lot from working there. Most of my friends complain that they do not want to find any part time job because they are already very busy with their schoolwork and their social lives. It is true that having a part-time job sometimes makes it difficult to find time to do everything that you want or need to do, but putting yourself in situations in which you're a little bit uncomfortable is one of the best ways to grow and become stronger as a person, student, and an employee. What's more, by having a part-time job I can make enough money to fund all of my personal expenses such as food, rent, and entertainment. The fact of the matter is that my friends who do not have money cannot have as much fun as I have or have as much freedom as I have. It sometimes seems sad, but money really is power. If you have a part-time job, you can make money, you can gain skills, and you can make professional contacts.",C2
"Smoking means smoke the tobacco in folding paper called Cigarette. Our society have some rules and regulation to live in it.

"Smoking harms the health of smokers and nonsmokers to health. According to research, indirect smoking is more harmful than direct smoking is. Therefore, smoking in public places should be made perfectly. Those who do not even know that the damage is not right. In addition, there are many family restaurants. Despite signs of smoking in restaurants, there are people who smoke. It makes people frowned upon. Children should not be exposed to cigarette. Guests come to enjoy its meal unpleasant feeling because of the smoke should also think. A lot of people in a restaurant require consideration of smokers. They go to places other than restaurants could smoke a cigarette. The restaurant is a place to eat is not the smoking room. Smokers know the risks of secondhand smoke, yet the problem continues a consideration that is lacking. If the problem is solved yielding a little. Non-smoking and smoking areas in restaurants and it is essential to put them strictly regulated. Nonsmoker's rights, too, is important, but should respect the rights of smokers think. Must find ways to live together. Effective manner while minimizing the damage should understand each other. Do not wait for the victim of a selfish need special attention.",B1
"Part-time job is a job that doing at free time. Many people have a part-time job to get more money. It is usually done by college student. At my college, Institute Technology of Surabaya (ITS), many college students have part time job. They get part time job if they have a lot of free time. But, they don't get it if they do not have a lot of free time. They usually take part-time job after their lesson done. There are many purpose college student take part time job for examples they take it to increase their money. They can use it to buy some books, to buy their daily need and to pay school fee. They take it not only to increase their money but also to train their soft skill. For example, if they get part time job at restaurant, they get ability to service much people. It is good for their soft skill. It will help them when they had work So, part time job is important for college student with have a lot of free times and have good control of time. But, if they do not have a lot free time I should not get the job because it spend times and decrease study's time for the college.",B1
"I really agree with the statement ""Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country"" because smoking is a bad thing. It can harm everybody. In nowadays, many people still smoking. Moreover, Smoking not only harm smoker but also harm another people. Smoking is banned in many places. Smoking is so dangerous and has many disadvantages. Sometimes many children maybe smoke follow their parents or people around them. It is not suitable model for those children. Moreover, smoking can harm the environment too. It causes the Global warming and Green House Effect. The restaurants are the public that serviced many people. If smoking is not banned in the restaurants, it will have many effects to all people or all sides. I think that the government should do something for stop smoking such as, plan the project that can banned at all restaurants in the country or tell everyone that smoking has many disadvantages especially teenagers etc. Furthermore, Smoking cigarettes are drugs that can harm organs in your body. So, I think everyone should be stop and banned smoking. When someone smoking or something bad happen not only you sad but also another people especially parents will sad because smoking causes dead. So, Don't bring the bad thing causes you lost your lover. You should stop smoking or banned it before it's too late. In summary, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned in every places!",B1
"Smoking is a common activity in everyone's life. No matter who smoke, you cannot always avoid it. And the attitude to smoking is varied from people to people. In my opinion, smoking should be limited but shouldn't be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking can make people relaxed sometime. Especially for many businessmen under heavy stress, they need a convenient way to relax themselves. Smoking just can help them and keep them in a good condition. Secondly, for sure, smoking may be unhealthy to the smokers and the people around them. But smoking or not smoking is a private choice; we can't completely forbid it in all the restaurants. Just set a special place for these smokers in the restaurants can solve the problem too. Thirdly, if the smoking is banned completely in the restaurants, it must lead to terrible destroy in the cigarette industry. Many workers may lose their jobs and it will influence the economy of our society. So in conclusion, smoking should be limited in the restaurants but not banned completely in the restaurants. We just try to have a special place for smokers in the restaurants now and it will do less harm to non-smokers.",A2
"It is important for college students to have a part time job because they can gain experiences, developed their skills and personalities and earn money in the part time job. Part time job can develop them by practicing what they learned in the schools. They can have academic knowledge and hands on experience. Students can develop confidence, communication skills, time management. They can earn money and buy the things they want. They can use it for their future use, tuition fees and personal needs and socialize. Students with part time jobs learns to be reliant on their families as well as it is good preparation for their independent life in the near future. The most important thing to remember in having a part time job for college students is their ability to balance academics and their part time job. while having a part time time will develop financial independence, it may however defocus students from their studies. Many college students like me especially those who are financially under priviledged struggle to make both ends meet. The tuition fee and other school related expenses may always be a problem so to address this it is important for college students to have a part time job. 205",B1
"Almost all of my friends in college have part time jobs and so I think it is very important to have one too. By having a part-time job, I have the freedom of disposable income, and that allows me to go shopping or go out to eat with my friends whenever I want to. Although my parents pay for college, I do not think they should have to pay for all my day to day expenses and so I'm trying to do them a favor by supporting myself a little bit. Also, I really don't like the rich kids whose parents do everything for them and I think it is important for us to learn how to live and be responsible adults so that we can go out into the world one day and know how to take care of ourselves. There are plenty of ways to find a part-time job that doesn't get too much in the way of studying or hanging out with friends and you can also make many new friends if you have a part-time job. Finally, in some cases a part-time job can get you experience that you can use after you graduate. For these reasons I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.",C2
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by doing part-time job, they can find earning money very hard. So, they use their money seriously. And the college students have much time. So if they want travel abroad, they can make money by doing part-time job for their own. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work. Secondly, if they do a part-time job, they can meet people of variety generation, from children to senior adults. So they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they do a part-time job, the more evaluated they are. For example, their salary per hour is maybe up. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can know their suitable future job such as teaching children, or serve customs in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers. And they teach junior high school students studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. It is an important thing when they work. As above, they can know society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students have a part-time job.",A2
"One of the pollutions that close to us is toxic fumes from a cigarette. A cigarette is a small roll of finely cut tobacco leaves wrapped in a cylinder of thin paper for smoking. I have seen the smoker since age that I can remember the things. I am second hand cigarette smoke. I don't like this but I can't avoid every time. People know that smoking is bad for everyone but cigarettes can be sold in every market and every shop and they are convenient to buy by everyone who has age more than 18 years old. I think it is wrong to do like this. If we want to stop, we will destroy all of them. My uncle told me that the old day, the teenager smoked for fashion. They believed that smoking make they're cool. And I think nowadays they still like the past. Some smokers smoke because they were serious. I think they have another solution but they don't try to do. A person in my family is addicted to smoke. He smoke and smoke. In a day he smokes more than a pack of cigarettes. I don't want him to be like that. Now he's very weak and dowdy. His healthy is extremely bad and not as lively as before. This's one of the illustrations about smoking. I would like the smokers concern their health and care their self along with their family. Please, stop smoking before smoking stops you.",B1
"Smoking is an absolutely disgusting habit, and I have no sympathy for the people who choose to destroy their bodies by smoking cigarettes. The fact that smoking is allowed at restaurants in Japan is simply astonishing given the otherwise forward thinking and technological advancement in that country. In a Japanese history class, I learned that Japan is usually quick to import the customs of other countries and adapt them into their own unique Japanese way. Many states in the United States of America have already banned smoking in public places including restaurants, and this would lead me to believe that Japan will eventually do so as well. It is simply a matter of time until enough people realize that it is simply not acceptable to have a habit that can directly affect the health of other people around you especially people you don't even know. It would seem that any sensible person would not want to give a complete stranger any kind of health problems especially ones as serious as the ones that accompany smoking and second hand smoke. If the Japanese follow the pattern of their own history which has already been established I think that it is only a matter of time before they follow the example set by the United States and ban smoking in all the public restaurants.",C2
"As we all know, college is the bridge between schools and society. Therefore it's in great need that we college students take some part time jobs. In China, students are used to the school life. They are just connected to classmates and teachers and can get money easily from their parents. They will feel uncomfortable when they are suddenly faced with the society. They will feel tired when they have to earn their own life. However it will be rather different if college students do some part time jobs. Firstly, they will have four years to get used to the rules of modern society. That will make the adaptation smoother. Secondly, they will be able to communicate with business friends instead of classmates and teachers who are always supporting you, which make their future development easier. In a word, a man with four years' working experience is always more attractive than a freshman. This is the major meaning of taking part time jobs. In addition, taking part time jobs can earn some changes to improve your financial level. I can buy something I like without asking my parents for money. That will make me feel more independent. To be brief, it's of high value to do part time jobs.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completed banned at all the restaurants in the country. It's because smoking don't feel good to some people including me. I went to a restaurant with a friend who often smokes. When we had a dinner, he smoked and his smoke blew in my face, so I felt bad. Tastes of the dishes became bad. If all smokers were to be able to care about place and others, we don't need to make rules. I can't understand that why young people become smokers although it is clear medically that smoking is very bad for healthy. Moreover passive smoking is also bad for us. In Norway and in some states of America, Australia and other countries, all the restaurants ban smoking. It's because passive smoking wreck employees there. So making legislation to ban smoking in the restaurants and hotel is important for non-smokers and also for smokers because it might make them keep from smoking. Young people who become smokers might decrease. Compared with the West, Japan falls behind for campaign against smoking. So I feel happy that the mood of no-smoking spreads in the society and that people around me are more temperate in their smoking. Therefore, we need to have a legislation to ban smoking.",B1
"I think college students should have a part-time job in their college life. It can learn a lot out of the class. For example, you can learn how to talk to the customer or hoe to face the problem you face. And you can earn money by your own. I think even school can teach you how to learn the math questions or how the history is, but it can teach you how to face the question in our daily life. Maybe someone will say, you can't learn a lot from part-time job, but I think the job can give you more than money. When I enter college, many people just study, study, and study. They didn't do anything out of class. I think it's not good, because they just know a part of school life, they didn't see more about world. In my college life, I did some part-time jobs. From cram school to restaurant, I think the experient is so great for me that I can't tell everyone. My boss also taught me a lot, because their experiences are more than me. I am glad to meet them, and I think I won't forget it until been an old woman. So I just know college students can learn a lot from part-time jobs, and if you don't forget you are a student, you will be great in your study and your part-time job life.",A2

Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because it is a public place. Not all the customers in a particular restaurant are smokers. Second-hand smoke is more dangerous. It causes many diseases to people and to our environment. If they keep on smoking in public places like restaurants it will have bad effects to the health of the other customers and also to the business. They might not come back because of the bad environment causing by the smokers. It causes pollution. Our environment also has its right. It will decrease the customers coming from a particular restaurant. And smoking to public places attracts young generation to do this. The government should do something about this issue because it is not just about the health of the people it is also about business. Banning smoking in public places will give justice to non-smokers. We live in a democratic country so people who smoke have also their rights. They can do it by isolating themselves in order not to cause any problems to others. A smoker's choice should not affect the health of other people. Anyone is not permitted to cause harm to people's health. Banning smoking in public places will also benefit the smokers.,B1
"Probably each of us has experienced a situation, when we were sitting in a restaurant and someone near started to smoke a cigarette. We became unwillingly second-hand smokers. This is happening to me very often and every time I wish smoking would be banned in public places. Restaurant is a place for rest and not gets disturbed physically and mentally. If it got banned we can save ourselves from a number of diseases, can have a reasonable environment which is suitable for families in restaurants. Smoking in restaurants is a disruption to everyone's meal, not just the smokers. The dividers that restaurants owners provide do not keep the smoke from spreading to non-smoking areas. Ventilation along with dividers may be a way to solve the smoke problem. A lot of people argue that smokers have their rights and that we live in a democratic country, where everyone can do whatever he wants as far as he does not break the laws. According to these people legalization of a law, which prohibits smoking in public places is against the personal rights of the smokers. After all, they are not violating the rights of the others, because the non-smokers can leave whenever they want. But would it not be more reasonable for the smoker to leave when they want to smoke a cigarette? In my opinion it would, because the smoker wants to do something that limits the people around him and not vice versa. It is known that smoking is unhealthy and causes cancer. But not many people try to stop the spreading of it. In conclusion I would say that many smokers gradually give up smoking if they have to overcome complex obstacles each time when they want to light a cigarette. Consequently, banning smoking in public places leads to decrease of smoking generally and especially of young generation. Better health and lower medical cost are the results.",B1
"I agree with topic A because an allowance from parents may not enough in some month so we should have a part-time job to get more extra money. For all students who are not rich enough how do they buy their new clothes monthly if without more money that over used from their allowance. For example you must buy something for your friend in the end of a month but your mom could not give you dollars to buy it because it too expensive and not important to buy, so what would you do? Of course you need more money you should work to get money for many special ceremonies like farewell party, Freshmen night hosted by your faculty. All these ceremonies make you to get wonderful dress so you can use money from your job to buy it easily which is better than beg from your mom. Sometimes not only that special ceremony there are many things to but for your education at university like books pens if you can buy it by yourself you and your family will be pround of you and love you more than the last time you have ever paid by your mom's money.",B1
Nowadays people who are addicted to smoking are losing ground. Secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. A warning of the danger of smoking is printed on every pack of cigarettes.

And don't expose children to secondhand smoke. Because Children has no level of immunity. Also Smoking can increase the risk of developing heart disease. Many American cities and several states have restricted smoking in private and public places. So Korea's government emulates America's policy. Cigarette smoking is responsible for about 90% of deaths from lung cancer. Smoking can seriously damage your health. These days it's tough being a smoker. Because a smoking area is going down more and more. Smoking may reduce blood flow to the discs and cause them to degenerate. Smoking is bad for your health. So Nowadays The number of smokers is on the decrease. But Adults raise their eyebrows at the idea of students' smoking. Smokers often have raised blood pressure. Health is a national power. So I disagree students' smoking. As a result Smokers have higher chance of getting lung cancer than nonsmokers. You can quite Smoke.,B1
"I agree with this statement. I think college student should have a part-time job. Then, I want to express why I agree. First, college students need a lot of money, because they have many things to do. For example, to live alone far from family, to study abroad, to take part in a club and so on. In addition, they also spend much money on only learning in college. In order not to depend too much on their parents, they should have a part-time job and get some money. Second, by having a part-time job, they will be able to get not only money but also important things. They will be able to make new human relationships and get some new skills. Those things will surely help them when they are in trouble. Finally, if now they can learn how to work and how to earn money, they will be able to work smoothly when they get a job. Almost all of college students will start some job after graduate college, but some of them will fail in something and worry about the failure. But if they had experienced similar situations before, they will be sure to get through the difficulty. To have a part-time job is very useful for them. Since, I think, to have a part-time job is very important for college student. Actually I have a part-time job now, and I get some money and learn many things. I want to make good use of what I learn from a part-time job.",B1
" As we all known, the argument against smoking become normal. Nowadays smoking has been shown to be dangerous to our health, living environment as well as our life quality. From the survey about smoking in 2002, it's said that the number of smoker in China reached 13 hundred million, which took up a large number of the population. What's more, recent research has shown that non-smokers can 30 percent of smokers all over the world, suffer health problem if they spend long period of time with people who do smoke. So, people who smoke in the restaurants will do harm to people who are non-smokers around them. Those non-smokers all hate it. However, smoking undoubtedly helps many people to relax, especially when they are relaxing with friends in the restaurant. Though smoking does lots of harm, somebody would also argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. In my opinion, people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smoker but surely they should be free to smoke where it is suitable. I suggest that public place like restaurant should seta special room for smoker to enjoy their ""bad habits at will.",B1
"Absolutely I agree with the point. Restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smokes will destroy the warm atmosphere. And this also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that whether smoke depend on personal preferences, this is selfish behavior. It will make other people be unhealthy. The important thing is smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like those people who smoke in public place. As is known to all, smoking just make people increase the risk of cancer. And those second-hand smokers will be more influenced than smokers. Especially in public places, smokes are extremely harmful. Smokes are poison gas. If there is no one smokes in restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokes give up smoking so it is also benefit for them. A professor called Peter in HK university saidï¼‚one cigarette can kill at least 50 miceï¼‚. You know, smoking just make people feel boring but no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this well themselves. We have an obligation to make people more health life.",A2
"I agree with the idea because I think it is really bad to smoke in the public, such as restaurants. We all know that there are still many people smoke in the public, nowadays. It has many bad effects for all the people, not only yourself, but also the others. On the one hand, though people are finding it entertaining to smoke, it does harm in several ways. You will breathe bad air. In the same way, it will have bad effects on the people around you in the public places. From a professional standpoint, smoking in the public places makes everyday bad. On the other hand, it does harm to the atmosphere, and it will affect the environment, too. We all know that there are many people in the public places, so it is hard to make the air clean. After a long time, the air will become worse and worse. Maybe it can cause some diseases. In a word, it has many bad effects. We should control ourselves not to smoke in the public places. In conclusion, we can't smoke in the public places. Because there are many bad effects. Apart from the two bad effects, there are many other bad effects. So let's stop smoking in the public places.",B1
"Our great leader and founder of Pakistan QUAID ?E-AZAM said that Students are the back bone for our country Our country Pakistan is not very good in economic. People have not enough money to study their children's. So they don't to cause to go their children's in schools and collage. In our country the percentage of poorness is above 75%. Peoples have not enough money to cause to go their children in collages. They cannot afford the expenses of study. Those children who want to learn they do part time jobs at some places and afford the expenses of their studies. So the part time job is necessary for collage students. Due to doing jobs their confidence level is also increase which is very good for them. They have much power, confidence and strength to solve the problems. They can face any difficulties of their life. But for the collage students the jobs are those in which they don't work hard. If their jobs are tough than they do not take a proper time to their studies, which is very dangerous for them. Jobs are easy and cannot take a lot time of them. In this way they don't take a proper time to their studies. In some cases, parents of the students pressurize their child to earn money to support their family and they became a heddle in the way of their child. Parents do not pressurize their children's to earn money if they want to learn? Now our government has free the education up to metric level and provides the scholarship to girls. Now education became free up to metric level. They also provide books to students. So students can easily get education up to metric level. Part time jobs are done, when they are in collage and they don't afford the expenses of education. So part time job is necessary for students.",B1
"It is common knowledge that smoking is detrimental to health. Although smoking is a personal choice, it can become a public affair especially when the smoke is inhaled as second-hand smoke, which is equally harmful as smoking directly. This reason in itself is substantial enough to call for a ban of smoking in public areas. In Singapore, the prohibition of smoking has gradually been extended from hawker centers to void decks. However, there still remain areas that the law does not cover. One of these areas is the bus stop, especially when it is crowded, one person smoking can easily cause irritation to all the other people waiting for the bus. Of course, one may say that it is unethical to ban smoking in public places. After all, smoking is a personal choice, and by placing a ban, it is tantamount to infringing upon the personal rights of that person. However, it must be noted that in this case, the right of choosing to smoke is not infringed. The smoker still can smoke; just that he is limited to smoking only on his own property. Smoking in restaurants not only causes health hazards, but also poses a risk to the cleanliness of the food served as well as the general ambience of the restaurant. Surely no one wants to eat in a restaurant that has smoke all round? Thus, it is not unethical to ban smoking in restaurants. In fact, it is ethical, because only then can the good of the majority by maximized. ",B1
"I agree with that because smoking is not good for health. It not good for yourself and anybody around you even they don't smoking but if they smell it, it cause of a cancer for them or any other decease. Smoking in restaurants it disturb everybody who come to eat it can make they upset with that. How do you feel if you don't smoke but have to smell it. For me, I always have an headache when I smell the cigarette. I really don't like it but I just don't know how to stop people that are smoking. Smoking will destroy your body it makes you like a zombie. Your eyes and your lips will look awful and terrible. You mouth got very bad smell too. Both men and women, if you smoke, you never look good with cigarette. Restaurants should banned smoking all in the country. There should be rules and fine if someone breaks the rules. No smoking in restaurants is make an atmosphere better and everyone will come to eat more. May be the restaurants will allow to smoke outside but people who smoke shouldn't smoke in the publish area they should smoke in private area for make sure that will not avoided the other people.",B1
"The prohibition of smoking is expanding from day to day, and it is bringing an uproar among smokers. While many people choose to ignore these protests, I believe it is unnecessary to ban smoking in all restaurants, for smokers deserve the right to smoke and it is better to lead them to stop smoking on their own will rather than forcefully banning them. First, smokers deserve the right to smoke as much as non-smokers have the right not to inhale smoke. As citizens of democratic countries, smokers as well as non-smokers should equally be granted to act as they please, as long as their conduct does not invade the interests of another individual. Then, one may argue that smoking is harmful to the health of second-hand smokers. True as it seems, this argument is insufficient to support the complete banning of smoking in restaurants. Alternatively, we can always separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers. When there is a way to guarantee the rights of both sides, it would be unfair to pass an act only in favor of non-smokers. Second, when we want people to behave in a certain way, it is much more mature to lead them to do so voluntarily rather than compel them. A strong support for the ban would be that it also works to the benefits of smokers. However, the way they come to a stop should be that they choose to do so because free will has a significant meaning. Specifically, they should be educated to perceive the possible consequences to their health and realize the financial burden of smoking, but never forced. In short, helping smokers truly realize the advantages of quitting would naturally promote healthier views and lead to fewer smokers in public places more efficiently than simple bans. In summary, for the sake of equal rights for smokers and a mature method of helping them, the idea of banning smoking in all restaurants should be rejected.",B2
"Part time job means earning at the free time. With the passage of the time the value of the study is increased and most of countries meet the price crisis. Most of the students do job at their free time to fulfill the needs of their expenditures whose parents cannot afford. Students, who are interested in learning and belong to poor family, do part time job to fulfill his need. Most of the countries are underdevelopment and Pakistan is such a country most of the population of Pakistan is poor they cannot afford the expenditure of the study of their children. But they have great fond that they taught their children. Anyhow, Part time job is benefit or not be. It is not benefit because it has a great effect on study. The attention of the students toward the job his attention is fully divided. He gives very short time to study. Due to it his progression in study is weaker day by day. . He remains busy whole day and does not give much time to his family. It is benefit in that respect due to the part time job students knows the importance of earning and they expend money accurately at right time. The experience of the students is enhanced by the job they well aware the social values. If a student do job by teaching the other students its knowledge and experience is increased and he is able to meet the requirement of his life. Through part time job he was able to serve country and nation and he become more patience. He spends his life as a person of well experienced. Thus, part time job is necessary for all the students.",B1
"I think it's important to Alba. But it is important to attending university to study Does not interfere with studies, as many will think its okay to Alba.

"I agree this statement. Because part-time job give us precious experience. And, we need money to live. For example, I work in JUKU. I experience precious time. Education is reception for me before. But, education means giving for me now. Education is very difficult. I realize this now. First, I worry that I work in JUKU. Now, I don't regret that. Making money is also important point for us. I was given money by parents before. So, making money is also giving me a few proud. Sure, I am not independent and can't live without parents. Junior high school student is difficult for me. I usually can't realize what they think. But, they give me energy. Maybe, some people think that part-time job prevented students from studying. It is right idea, sure. Some people can't concentrate in their study. But, other people can work in part-time job and can study hard. Maybe, it is minority. But we should not ignore them. Both studying hard and working hard in part-time job is difficult for young people. Little by little, we will be used to being this. If we used to being this once, we may are strong as adult than before. So, part-time job is important for us.",B2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They should try to understand our society more and more. So they can know a part of this society to have a part-time job. Now I have a part-time job. I work at kaiten sushi in Osaka. I work there for half of year, but I could know many things. The things I knew are three subject. First, I could know importance of the money to stand on my own feet. Before than now, I have received money from my parents. In those days, I thought it is a little. So I always thought that I want to get much money. Now I work to get much money. So I can do many things. But I understand to get a lot of money is very very difficult!! Second, I can communicate many kind of people. In my college, I am not able to communicate varies people, because the college students are similar. But in my workplace, there are many kind of peple. For example, the one man is high school student. And the one woman is musician. And the other man is the elderly. Finally, part-time job is not real bussiness. So schoolwork and a part-time job are compatible with each other. College students must study the first. So a part-time job is the best work.",A2
"I think that they forbit our smoking in restaurants. I have three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not healthy. It is known that one cigarettes shortens our life seven minutes. A fact that the smoke of cigarettes injure our health is proved scientifically with today's medicine. Smokes don't stay outdoors. But, smoke is filled indoors such as in restaurants. So, it makes people do'nt want to smoke smoke. A number of people don't like smoke of cigarettes. So, in restaurants, a lot of people dislike smoke of cigarettes too. It is hated by many people who don't want to smoke. It is not good fact morally. Secondly, cooks want us to enjoy their cooking with all of our senses. We enjoy cooks with firstly eye, secondly noses, thirdly touch, fourthly tongue, finally ears. If it smelled smoke of cigarettes in restaurants the good smells of cooking is made by cooks is spoiled. Thirdly we should enjoy not cigarette but tasting delicious cooking or funny conversations with friends or family. Their smoking time prevents us from enjoying those pleasure. When we were in restaurants, we had better enjoy the atmosphere in restaurants as much as we can. And so, I think they should not smoke in restaurants",A2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can get a lot of techniques and knowledge through part-time job. After we get a job, they sometimes helpful to our job. Now, I am working part-time in sushi shop. There, Owner usually says that fine greeting and smile are very important. We must think most about guest. Under employment, it is not changed. Also, recently NEET is increasing. I do not think they are not going to get a job, but they have anxiety about technique and knowledge of jobs. They once have a part-time job, the anxiety may be cleared. Therefore NEET will be decreased. Decreasing NEET is good for future of Japan. So, I think part-time job is good for college students. In fact, through working as part-time job, I am developed. For example, a year ago, I am very shy. I could not speak stranger. But now I am able to speak stranger, of course guest. Also before I begin part-time job, I did not smile very much. But in the sushi shop I forced smile. Now my smile has increased in my daily life. Last reason is that through part-time job, we can meet a lot of people. He or she may be best friend or partner of our life. Talk with their, we can get new knowledge. It is important for college students to have a part-time job for these reason.",A2
"I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons about that. First, they need money. It cost a lot of money to enter a university. Of course, it is not they but their parents that paid the money. I believe they should pay back the money more or less to their parents, and some students want to go to a graduate school. In addition, generally, college students spend much money. For example, the money for buying nice clothes or shoes, hanging out with one's friends and playing club activity. For another reason, they can learn how the society is. Part-time job enables them how to make a good relations with other members or their boss. They attain kinds of skills and learn how strict and severe rule is. They will also learn how difficult they make money. You may say that if you do part- time job too hard, it causes bad effects to study in university. It is true but, actually, they have a right that they can control their own shift to some extent. If they want to earn a lot of money in a short time, they should work as a cram school teacher. Besides, I have a lot of friends, who work really hard, and get a great school records. That is why having a part-time job is necessary for college students.",B1
"Part time jobs are those small jobs which students at college level do along with their studies. The students are bound to do these jobs because they have no other way and their parents are poor so they cannot afford their children dues. The student does jobs in different small places. Their health is affected by doing part time jobs. They cannot study seriously. Their result goes down. With the passage of time when the burden of work increases on them. They become sick due to the work. They cannot take leave for even one day in college the lessons are left and salary is lessoned. So they cannot rest they have to go to college in morning and job in evening and after that they have to study. The students who are only studying have better results than the students with jobs. The government is doing nothing for these students and N G O or any other institution is working on this project. Government should collect funds for these students who are facing many problems in society. The youth is damage and is in danger. If they cannot seriously study obviously they will not have better jobs in future and cannot participate in the development of their country. In Pakistan a country, which is underdevelopment this country is facing many problems and students are facing this type of problems due to poverty. We should also do something for it.",B1
"In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, students gain work experience before they enter the society. In this way, they can find what they are really interested in. By touching a variety of part-time jobs, they make their own decision. On the other hand, if they want to study graduate school, they can easily know what they want to major in. In addition, having a part-time job is helpful for university students' time management. For instance, they have to strike a balance between school and work. Also, this will help them to handle their business orderly and further have free time with friends. Finally, students know the difficulty of making a living. Most of their expenses are given by their parents so they don't have to worry about tuition. Take my friend for an example. She is the youngest one in her family and she relies on them or friends very much. Whatever she does, she used to find someone to help her. Although she is an adult in law right now, she is still childish. If she has a part-time job while study in college, she would be more mature. In brief, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because they can gain experience and learn how to make their time management, they even become mature after taking the job. Above reasons, it is necessary for them to take a part-time job.",B1
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. I think that college is not only a place where we study but also where we make humanity. Humanity is made when we have communication. And a part-time job is a good chance which we have a communication. So I agree with a part-time job. However, there are many kind of part-time job. Not all part-time jobs have a good effect on us. So we have to choose a part-time job carefully. I think that there are three conditions of a good part-time job. First is money. Most of us have a part-time job to get money. If we can get a lot of money, we will call it a good job. Second is a member of the job. Good communication requires good members. If there are people who don't have humanity, probably you are unwilling to be concerned with him or her. As a result, you can't have communication. Third is detail of the job. It is important that we choose a job that we can use our advantages. For example, People who are good at communication should choose the jobs which have many communications. And it is also good that people who are poor at choose the jobs as a practice. In the end, experiences of a part-time job have a good effect on us. So college students should have a part-time job.",A2
"It's not important for university students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs reduce students' time to study. University life is not easy, especially for the students who want to get a good academic result at the end; 24 hours for study may not enough for them. If it's true, how can a student have extra time for part-time job? Part-time jobs make student less concentrate at their study. Applying part-time job may not be successful; students may search a lot of information of job recruitment, apply a lot of jobs, and go to interview one after another. It not only wastes students' time, but also wastes their energy. Somebody may argue that job experience is important for job-seeking. If it was true, university should change its name to job training center. The main concern for university students should be knowledge chase, and this is also what employers consider. Part-time jobs experience does not impress employers in good ways, as opposite, employers consider students with part-time job experience had less concentration at their study, especially for who had bad academic result. Some university require students to do a job, which is related to their course, before they graduates. That's true, but it must be a full time job, such as internship, not a part-time job.",B1
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students only study but also experiment a lot of situation. A part-time job has the things that I do not get in the college life. I talk about me. I have the part-time job in Book off. I learned a lot of things. For example, I learned that being said Thank you is more pleasant than I think. I learned importance of money and do not use little money than the time which I am a high school student in. I learned how to use correct Japanese languages and how to deal with a register. I communicated with all kinds of people and I increased the chances that I talked with old people in. I knew a lot of things and I increased friends. If I do not have part-time job, I do not learned a lot of things and increased the time which I do nothing. But, I think that it is bad to work part-time too much and not to study. I think that a working student should work part-time moderately. So, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",A2
"I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. In China, there are quite a large number of students cannot afford their tuition. For the reason of attending college and daily life, sometimes they have to find one or more part-time jobs. Of course, there are still large numbers of students have no problem with money. But I think for them, taking a job doesn't mean to earn money but to earn more experience. College is just like a small society. Having a part-time job at college can help us enter the society easier. And I think only when we start to make money we realize the difficulty in it. We know for our parents making money is not that easy too. We are adults now and we should act as an adult. Even though having a part-time job can benefit us a lot, we still should pay attention to it. Firstly, it's important to choose a job fit for us. Say we are now at collage and we can't spent all day at the work. What's more, we mustn't forget our study. Make sure our study is developing smoothly and then we can spent sometime at the job. I think most collage students may have the experience of taking a part-time job, maybe long or short, maybe one kind or many kinds of. I indeed appreciate my part-time job as a family-teacher. Being a student for so many years, it's cool to sometimes become a teacher!",B1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons I think so. By the way I have a part-time job. I wrote reasons which base on my experience of part-time job. At first, I can have a experience of society by having a part-time job. When we do something, we have commitments. In part-time job, I feel it strongly. We can't get money easily. I did hare work and then I could get money. I can learn importance of money. We, university student, can change part-time jobs so we can be a man who sale bread or clothes and then be a man who deliver news paper or pack or a man cook crape or okonomiyaki, teacher of private school, a shop boy of first food or coffee shop and so on If we were thirteen years old, could we change the jobs easily? I think the answer is no. Changing jobs is not easy for a businessman. Second reason is that we can meet many people at part-time job. I made friends with many people at part-time job and some one go to different university, some one is different age, some one is from different part of Japan. If I didn't start part-time job, I would never meet some of them. Things talked by different university student or different age person are very interesting to me. I can know what I have never known. Third reason is that getting money refers to help my parents and we can get money to do what I want to do by getting money. I can buy books and clothes, bags. It follows from this three reasons that I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",A2
"About being in a restaurant about smoking is a problem. Restaurant as well as smoking in all public areas must be. If you do not think that is enjoyable to yourself. Passive smoking and risk of harm to others illustrates. The perils of secondhand smoke A lot of people who do not know it, you need to stop smoking in public places and restaurants to think. Nice and tasty food to eat are we doing when we smoked at the next table will be happy. If you feel bad to do good to each other's it do not think it. And you want a pleasant atmosphere in any restaurant. However, a side table filled with smoke from a cigarette you will feel if you do not want get into a restaurant. Cigarette smoke is harmful to children and the elderly too much. Damage compensation if we go to them, how would you do? To do this requires non-smoking. And the smoke itself is harmful to the body of rotting lungs. So these are my thoughts. Booking agent for the health of each other in order to agree that smoking in restaurants. Thanks for listening, in my opinion is an awful lot.",A2
"Smoking should be complete banned at all the restaurants in the country. Whether smoke or not in the restaurants has been a topic for people to argue for a long time. Following is the reason why people agree to ban to smoke. Restaurant is a public place, especially a place for people to have meals. It is stated that smoking has many disadvantages both to the smoker and people around him or her. So, If someone smokes in the restaurant, it will have a bad affect on the surroundings. For example, some people feel disgusted with the bad odor. Besides, the pollution that smoking cause may lead to the unfresh food customers eat, decrease the quality of having meals. Also, smoke will influence other people's health, especially pregnant women. To take care of people who don't like the odor of smoke and their health, it sounds good to forbid smokers. However, some might think this way is not fair to smokers. It is inconvenient to them, in fact. It will affect the business of restaurant, either. But if the restaurant can provide a special small place such as a room Where people smoke will not bother anyone else, this way would be much easily to do. To maintain the sanitation as well as offer a comfortable place for people to eat, smoking should be banned in the restaurant.",B1
"Nowadays, having a part-time job has been a trend among college or university students. Some consider that it is important for college student to have part-time jobs; while others hold the opposite attitude towards it. In my opinion, I think it is crucial for college students to get a part-time job, and I have several reasons why. To begin with, by doing the work assigned by the boss, students can gain experiences from their part-times. During work time, a student may face a lot of difficulties such as troublesome customers, lazy and irresponsible colleagues, mean and strict supervisors, to name but a few that they might not confront at schools or homes. From dealing with these difficulties, a student can acquire valuable skills on interacting with people properly, finding the best solution to solve a problem, the bright or dark side of human, and among others which later on will definitely be useful when they enter society. In addition to gaining experiences, students can also earn some money in order to help their parents pay their tuition. What's more, there might be extra money for students to spend meanwhile they don't have to ask their parents for more money. Doing a part-time job is certainly something that a student will benefit from. Of course, there are drawbacks for college students to do part-time jobs such as declining grades or lack of concentration on courses. However, I believe that a student is mature enough to determine what one's priority is and enjoy both his or her college life as well as part-time job!",B2
"I agree with this statement because there are two reasons. Firstly, a cigarette does harm not only smoker, but also people that are around smoker. And secondly, smoke disturbs comfortable eating time. It is said that smoking shortens smokers' life. Person who often smokes is likely to get severe disease, for example cancer, and die in his early age. If someone smokes in official space like a restaurant, smoke of cigarette spreads around smoker, and people around him are also damaged from cigarette. Unfortunately, harm which people around smoker receive is much bigger than harm which smoker receives. Bad smell also spreads during smoking. For smoker smell of cigarette may be good, but it is quite bad for nonsmoker. Smoke makes nonsmoker uncomfortable. At restaurant many people, from children to senior, enjoy eating dishes. They are enjoying both tasting and smelling nice foods. But with smoke, they can't enjoy special eating time perfectly. Smoke prevents nonsmoker from smelling delicious foods. Like this, smoking causes trouble to many customers who don't smoke. So Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoker should smoke in private space, should not smoke in official space where there are many people who don't like smoke.",B1
"Having a part time job imposes both positive and negative effects on a college student. On a positive perspective, working part time at a young age prepares a student for real life after schooling. He/she is trained to be more responsible as he/she progresses in his/her job. When a college student works part time, he/she also achieves a sense of fulfilment in what he/she does. Once he/she sees a pay check with his/her name on it, the sense of achievement he/she gets is unparalleled. Moreover, a college student who works part time can foresee and ultimately discover what career would fit his/her skills; if ever his/her skills do not fit his/her ambitions, he/she can then focus on developing the skills needed to match that ambition. Money-wise, a college student who has a part time job can easily assist whoever is financing his/her studies. On the other hand, working part time can also make a student less focused on his/her schooling. Although he/she is preparing himself/herself for the real world through work, a degree matched with honors and achievements is what an aspiring employee would need to get into a proper job. In addition, a college student may be discouraged to pursue his/her degree if he/she entertains the thought that the job he/she has can already sustain him/her.",B1
"I am of the opinion that while it may be financially beneficial for college students to hold a part-time job, it is not of paramount importance that they should be employed. As a science student, my schedule is usually packed with lectures and tutorials during the semester. What little free time that is available to me will usually be spent with my family and my friends. Having started my final-year project about three months ago, my leisure time has dwindled to a bare minimal, such that even a simple dinner with my family is now a luxury that I hardly get to enjoy. Given the demanding schedule of college students, or at least that of a final-year science student, I feel that it would be difficult for college students to hold a part-time job. A part-time job requires a certain level of commitment and the lack of time is something that makes it extremely difficult for me to hold a part-time job. While the additional income would no doubt come in handy, I feel that the job of a college student is to learn as much as he or she can during the course of study and to channel his or her energy mainly to the pursuit of a degree. This itself may be viewed as a form of commitment. From this perspective, part-time jobs may be viewed as a form of distraction. ",B2
"I think this is It is good for students to have part-time jobs. I think this is very common that students do part-time jobs while studying in foreign universities. It's obvious that if you don't work, you will have more time to study, but doing a job can get you some income to survive or get some pocket money without depending on parents. Research has shown that those students who work while studying tend to understand and grasp their studies much better than those who are not on job. They understand the nature of business and get a practical learning about how things are done. For example if a student is studying telecommunications and works at a call center, he will understand each and every thing much better. However students working while studying should definitely not divert from their studies and keep a balance between their studies as well as job. Types of part-time jobs that students at University of Florida do includes Child care, landscaping/maintaining garden/gardener, swim lesson instructor, house cleaning, tuition (tutor), office assistant, management assistant, delivery jobs, lifeguard, sales assistant, recreation assistant, web designers, violinist/musician, mailing letters, dishwasher, IT technical assistants, tour guides, book keeper, delivery work, receptionist, creative writers, drivers, photographers, graphic designers.",A2
"Smoking must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It's not should be banned, it must be completely banned. As you know, there are so many smokers live in our world. And also there are few non-smokers live here. But you see, there is no place for non-smokers. Smokers always smoke almost everywhere, they smoke in bus stop, terminal, toilet, school. . . It's difficult to find non-smoking place. Why always minority has to endure by majority? It's not fair. You know, we always heard about that secondhand smoke is not good. But if smokers smoke inside, it's worse than smoke outside. Especially, in restaurant? Uh-oh, never. There are pregnant women in restaurant. It's the worst thing to fetus. I know, I maybe a little extremist but it am about ethic problem. Well, maybe it's just the matter about one cigarette, however; more think about it. What about if your child is deformity, and you are not a smoker and your spouse also, and it's not your fault? Who could recompense this matter? No one. Your fault is just eaten with your spouse or alone in the restaurant which is allowed smoking. So, what do you think? I think that's why I insist smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants.",B1
"Agree with the smoking ban in restaurants. It is the restaurant of a service many people both young, adults, elderly and also the recess. If allowed to have smoking in restaurants. It may be a nuisance to others is very and the smell of cigarette smoke, it also resulted harm people nearby as well. Which is not beneficial to them. Therefore, banning smoking in public places or in restaurants is benefit for all people.

"As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. Smoking in public is prohibited. Now, in many public places are set special smoking-room, giving people who want to smoke providing a place. In my opinion, this is a very good method to prevent people from smoking in public places. Why we all say that smoking is harmful? Although in some smokers opinion, smoking is to alleviate the pressure of work, can let their spirits up. But, smoking has serious threat to people's health. Our health is very important. We can reduce our stress by many other ways. For example, we can go out to travel or chat with friends. These are some useful method to release our minds. Then, Smoking let us spend a lot of money. This is a kind of unnecessary spending. If we donate these money to the hope project, it will be how meaningful. Smoking in public is very immoral. Because, while your smoking in public, other non-smokers also can be affected. We should consider for others because this is very important. For the sake of our health, we should try to minimize the number of smoking. In a word, smoking is harmful to our health.",B1
"Where loose bell bottom pants and spikes haircut is fashion now a days, our generation is also attracted towards a notion called being COOL where putting cigarette in your mouth& blowing up its smoke with tilting lips is admired. People use it as a fashion and a passion. When someone is used to something it is called addiction, Mostly people start smoking accidentally or to show off in your friends' e. t. c. but later they are caught in habit of it. They have to smoke then for satisfaction. This causes huge wastage of money, energy and time also and hence a person becomes useless slowly. Smoking causes many diseases. Throat and lungs cancer are the most common ones. Cancer is a cureless disease; moreover medicines are so expensive that a middle class person can not afford it. Cancer is very fatal one and the organ having cancer becomes useless forever. The smoke of cigarette contains toxic chemicals which are harmful to smoker as well as people surrounding him. When a smoker blows up smoke and spread it all around the surrounding people are affected by it. Smoking causes demoralization of society. The noble person are also affected by it gradually they are in habit of it and hence it also causes decreasing number of moral persons in society. Restaurants and hotels are family places, people visit there for entertainment and to bring change in their daily bore routine. Family functions are also arranged in such places; smoking causes bad effects there and causes depression. Hence smoking should be banned in hotels and restaurants so that people can enjoy and live freely with their family.",B1
"Having a part-time job during university, it provides lots of personal and social benefits. Not only university students can take the advantages, but also the society. Hence, no matter what, it is essential for whose students to have a part-time job. For students themselves, on one hand, they get many of individual advantages. They earn money for their daily lives that learn to become financial independent. Also, teenagers can experience the real society before graduation. It's a rare opportunity to build up their own network, which benefits them a lot in future. Moreover, it's easier for them to set up targets after having working experience. For commercial society, on the other hand, the higher education level had, the higher salary offered. Due to lack of liquids, but, it's hard for small companies to employ educated elits. So, undergraduaters are suitable choices for these campanies. They are not only well-educated, but they also have more creativity than adults who work for many years. Meanwhile, teenagers have a chance to practice their creativity and critical thinking. All in all, based on the points I have mentioned above, it's worth and important for university students to have a part-time job.",B2
"Nowadays, we're College's tuition is very expensive I think. Not just my think, All of University student's think same thing. Part-Time-Job is very important thing of our Life. Because we should pay college tuition. But we don't have enough money, so we earn tuition. As a result, university presidents of Korea are like Money. They don't think student's grim realities of life. Now In Seoul, Some University Students demonstrated against the government Or President of University. I marched as in a demonstration of support. Lee. The Korea presidents said presidential election pledge. One of them for this pledge is a half price of University/College Tuition with no strings attached. But Lee. Don't keep his promise. It is natural for They to get angry. I'm upset too. All University students have a same mind and heart. National universities led the increase by raising tuition 41. 8 percent over the past five years, the NSO (National Statistical Office) noted. I don't look so bright of Korea's University. At this rate, All of Poor University's students are hounded by themselves creditors. It's an illogical conclusion. So we prepared our future's Home, Car, Family and Descendant. In conclusion, I agree about the Part-Time-Job for Our livelihood. At the present rate of progress, Korea's national power will be decline. All I care about is feeling complete is Our National Power.

"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as it entails many benefits. These benefits include vocational experience, financial independence, and practicing time management. Such benefits are useful immediately upon graduation and for the rest of their lives. Firstly, part-time jobs bring about vocational experience to prepare college students for the workforce, where they will experience how it is like to work in different environments. They will also gain technical skills and experience for the particular vocation they are working at, which could be useful in their future employment or personal lives. Secondly, a part-time job might allow college students to be financially independent to some extent, in which they support themselves through college using their earnings. Consequently, college students would also learn to manage their finances, as they would have to set aside money for their education, personal expenses, and savings. Even if their earnings are not enough to cover the cost of their education, it would allow them to repay their tuition loans earlier or offset more expenses. Thus, students need not be in debt after their education or being entirely reliant on financing. Lastly, part-time jobs would necessarily help a college student pick up time-management skills as they would have to juggle both their education and their job. This could be disruptive in the short term, but if the student is able to juggle both effectively, he or she would be much more productive, and less likely to be sidetracked by distractions common in college life. In conclusion, part-time jobs would be beneficial to college students in a myriad of ways, allowing them to pick up soft skills while financing themselves for the later part of their lives. ",B2
"I would have to say that I agree with this statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan, if it is not already been banned by the time I write this. Smoking causes a myriad of problems for health, and some of the common ones are cancer of the mouth and lungs, heart disease, high blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. We have done an in depth study on the human body in a lab class during my pre med school, and it was absolutely terrifying but also incredibly interesting to see just how damaging smoking was to the body's vital systems. The lungs became smaller, less elastic, and full of fluids. The heart became distended, and it could not as effectively push blood throughout the body. The liver began to develop sores as a result of trying to filter out all the harmful chemicals from the blood. It really was almost terrifying to see how much of the body was affected. When you smoke, you are not just hurting your lungs, you are hurting your whole body. So, if these results come to be well published or distributed in some other manner, even though I'm sure the Japanese already know a lot about this kind of thing, it will make a big step towards banning smoking in restaurants a reality.",C2
"I don't agree. I would add however, that it could be important but it really gets down to the individual concerned based on their needs, emotional maturity and general life experience levels. Having a part-time job while attempting to study a college degree on a full-time basis is not for everyone. In fact, I would venture to state that it could be detrimental for some more than others. While there are obvious benefits to be gained from working, the downside is that not everyone deals with pressure or stress in the same way. Placing too much pressure on oneself could quite possibly lead to dropping out, academic failure or quite literally traumatize students emotionally. This is not idle theory as there have been many examples that are a matter of public record which support my claims. I held a part-time position while I was at college and didn't encounter any difficulties which could not be easily overcome. I do recall quite clearly, that there were several students on campus who were not as blessed as I was and they experienced many, many problems which eventually led to them dropping out. So again I say, while it could be important to have a part-time job at college, it is subjective to the individual's personal circumstances.",C2
"Most people say that being a college student should have a chance to try a part-time job. But I think we shouldn't put much time on this kind of thing. As a student, despite of a college student, we still concentrate on our study. Being a college student means we have to have a lot of courses to study and have plenty of books to read. We also have to finish many tasks which teachers tell us to do. So we may be have little time and energy to think about the part-time job. We should do take some social activities at the right time, which definitely doesn't say we must take those things. As we know, should and must really have different means. If we don't distinguish the position between study and social works, we may be confused about our intention of going to the college. Besides, social activities don't completely equal with part-time jobs. We should make them clear. Social works are ok, but part-time jobs are a waste of time. I know a friend of mine, who ever tried a part-time job. He said that although it sounded perfect, it was very hard to make the two into the balance. During his work, he sometimes worked longer than he imaged. Most of his tasks were tough and boring, but he had to do that. He lost a lot of time to study his work, and didn't finish his homework perfectly. As a result, his final exam was not finished as good as it used to be. He said he learned a lot through this thing. We should keep this: To study well is our duty when we are students whatever the situation is.",B1
"Nowadays, many people smoking cigarettes. But most of the smokers are high school students. Smoking is really harmful for teenagers and matures. Cigarettes are bad for your health and are not good mentally. Cigarettes are the cause of various illnesses such as cancers, and impotents. And cigarettes smokers know that already. And cigarette smokers give a negative sight. But smoking is not only bad for you. Cigarette smokers can have a joy at it and give a benefit to the nation because the price of the cigarettes has state tax. And cigarettes also become a favorite food for the smokers. You can choose to smoke if you want. I think to say STOP SMOKING is not good idea. If the smoker does not give damage for another people, I think we need not to say like that. We can make them a lot of smoking area for the smoker and the nonsmoker. I smoke cigarettes too. But my father said it will be good for you that cutting the cigarettes. So I am considering quitting cigarette. I think if I quit it, I can save my money and my health. Thank you for reading my essay and I will study hard in English.",A2
"I do not agree with this statement. Full-time college students should focus on their studies. If they had any extra time, they should use the time to study so that they could realise their full potential in their studies. However, students with financial difficulty should have a part-time job to help lessen the financial burden of the family provided that the student is capable enough that having a job would not have significant effect on his studies. But this is group of people is a minority of the student population. Part-time job may also be useful for putting it in his resume if it is relevant to the career that the student hopes to do in the future. Part-time jobs could also be an exposure for the student so that he could get a better picture of how the industry is like. Although experience would be beneficial for students in the future, their results in their studies would be more important as it is still the most basic requirement that employers will be looking at. In conclusion, it is not important for all full-time college students to have a part-time job but it would be beneficial for students with financial difficulty or those who already have an idea on what his future career path will be.

"I agree because the restaurant is what Each individual person or family to family to eat together. Happy to do business or otherwise. If the restaurant is smoke will cause the atmosphere to shop completely free atmosphere. Restaurants and considered to be one of cleanliness. Restaurants need to focus on cleaning because of health related to the customer if the restaurant where the smoke when Customers come to the restaurant would be something bad back too, and may result in the body of the restaurant to eat healthy is not good. A cornerstone of the restaurant will give customers the impression that Must depend on many things. The taste is delicious and it Environmental atmosphere shop must be good. To attract customers into the store when customers will feel comfortable and all ages to focus. So, the restaurant should not smoke to interfere with the dining customers. It can cause health damage as a customer. Elderly, we should respect each other. And sometimes may be residual smoke into the food if you are smoking in the restaurant. Finally, anti-smoking in restaurants that Deemed to be correct and proper place because the restaurant is a place People that want to use something good.

"Smoking is a very harmful activity. The person who can smoke can not live a healthy life. As it is harmful for the person who smoke it also give the bad effect to the peoples which were in their surroundings.

In restaurant when people came with their families for the purpose of enjoyment to take the meal or to stay over here. To visit this area, or some other purpose. They irritated b/c of smoking. The people who smoke can also make irritation for the persons who were not smokers. Some people were elegiac they start cough and because of smokers.

"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it is not only to give money but it is one of the social studies, I think. Almost of college students can get money that they need to live from their parents. So I think that we don't need to have a part time job for getting money. I don't have a part time job now. But I can live enough now. And, college students have to study. But to have a part time job is not only for to get money. It is good social studies. It makes me thinking to get money is what and work in the social is what. And, we can learn social rule, way of talk, and more. For my example, I had a part time job in YAKINIKU restaurant. My work in the restaurant is service customer. I learn how to talk to customer and rule of meal a little. And the restaurant has many foreign customers, so I can learn English in restaurant well. Part time job have many what to learn and is very good social study. So I think college student have to have a part time job.",A2
"I'm of the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think so because I have ??? reasons. The first reason is that smoking does harm to not only smoking person but also the people around him. He is free, to be sure, to do something he wants to do. But, he doesn't have a right that he does harm to other people. Moreover, they have a right that they are healthy to live a long time. Furthermore, smoking does harm to them worse than him. I think that this action is very selfish. The second reason is that smoking has a bad influence on smoking person's health and the cigarettes are too expensive. Moreover, the cigarette's price keeps on increasing because the government will decide to add to cigarette's tax. The smoking persons pay a lot of money and are done harm to by the cigarettes. I don't think that is a very good idea. The third reason is that the most people around the smoking person feel unpleasant. If many people feel unpleasant when they are walking, they feel so when they are eating. People shouldn't do something other people feel so as possible as they could. Therefore Japanese's government should ban from smoking in restaurants.",B1
"Nowadays we can see that many of students specially the college students have a part time job after or before school.

Students also improve at multitasking and taking charge of their own life affairs. Successful handling of both job responsibilities and school workload also increase students ' self esteem as well as self confidence in their abilities. Part time job build responsibility, influence proper choices, build relationships, and even help develop self-discipline. Holding a job is a very productive and gratifying experience. The experience gained from a part-time job is priceless. Earning money in your own is a great experience. We cannot deny the fact that earning in your own is a great pleasure. There are some reasons why students have part time job. They want to explore things; they want to train themselves to earn money and to know that it is not an easy thing to earn money. They want to buy things in their own. They want to have work experience. They want to help their parents and for them to study because not all parents can afford their children to go for school. Many people think that having part time job can affect the studies of the students but I think having part time job can help the student's future become much better.

First, you can experience many things that you can't experience in college. For example you can teach math, English and science for high school or junior high school students. In part time job, you can discover your new sides. Second, we can enter new community. For example senior manager will tell you how to communicate customers, also you must tell youngers it too. Finally you will utilize its experiences for your own work in the future. Of course what you have learned in college is the most important to enter a company which you want to enter. But after entering, you may utilize what you have learned in part time job. If you don't have its experiences, you can't cope with many kinds of works or problems, for example how to communicate olds or youngers or solve some accidents which you don't think happens, however if you have it, you can act quickly and flexibly. Part time jobs have these good sides so college students work, if they don't forget to study.",A2
"Teenagers have no chance to get to know about this field in school learning English, mathematics, and Korean. To help the youth choose what they are interested in and will ultimately benefits to their jobs in the future, allowing them to work in the real world should be encouraged. Making money on their own in their early age provides educational lessons and merits ranging from gaining confidence, understanding of how market processes, realizing the difficulty of earning money and thus the necessity of saving. Getting paid for what they worked for can be a new kind of rewards of students especially those whose grades are always low. They will think even though they are not good at studying, they can be excellent at other fields being rewarded for what they put their effort. Understanding of hardness of making money and how it comes to them, the youth will learn economy and right consumption. Learning through working is more beneficial not only because some students do not like reading textbooks and taking lectures in classroom but also because knowing information as knowledge and understanding knowledge through experience is different. In this sense, letting Youngers get a part time job will be constructive experience. In conclusion, teenagers must be allowed to work as a part time if they are willing to for the aforementioned reasons.",B1
"Whether smoking should be completely banned at restaurants has certainly risen a controversy. Recently in Taiwan, our legislative Yuan has passed a law in order to ban smoking at restaurants and other public-open places. I personally support the law with my whole heart and strongly believe that smoking should be banned. In numerous medical reports, many evidence suggested that not only cigarette addicts but also people that breathe in the polluted air may die from respiration system related cancers. To be specific, people may be forced to die in an unpleasant way just because other's bad habit. I think anyone with consciousness will not allow this to happen. Furthermore, with fumes filling the atmosphere of a restaurant, harmful particles can possibly land on our dishes and travel all the way through our digestive systems. Some people might cough or sneeze when inhaling the fumes and thus spreading viruses or bacterium into the air. People go to restaurants to enjoy the great food and happy time, not to tolerate other's selfishness and get sick. Maybe those who hold different perspectives may not agree with my statement. However, I think for the sake of everyone's health, smoking should be banned not only at restaurants but every inches of land.",B2
" Whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants is always a hot topic among these years. And many European countries and America just have passed the law about smoking is not permitted in public places. Obviously, China has a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking, especially young boys and girls, some of them even are middle school students. No matter how harmful to smokers themselves. Nonsmokers argue that second-hand smoke is much more harmful to their health. It can cause cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases. As for me, I support this issue. Smoking poses health risks for both smokers and non-smokers. And research has found that second-hand smoke is as dangerous to non-smokers as first-hand smoke is to smokers. But nothing is absolute; I think all the restaurants can set an area for those smokers. We should protect their rights to smoke after all. And in fact smoking is just becoming a culture. Every country has it own smoking cultures. So completely banned smoking at all restaurants is not practical. Everything has two sides, smoking is also like this. So we can't say completely banned that smoking at all the restaurants, but to say that we can set a specific area for smokers. So that both smokers and nonsmokers can enjoy their meal and have a great joy during the meal.",B1
"Since I was young, my parents have brought me up in an environment in which smoking was never condoned. Whenever we went out and somebody was smoking nearby, my father would stare disapprovingly at the person and give intermittent snorts to show his irritation. There were a few times when he almost got into fights with these smokers as a result, but fortunately nothing serious occurred due to my father's candidness. I actually agree with the stance that my father takes, because smoking is a vice that shouldn't be condoned. It causes air pollution, and it has been scientifically proven that second-hand smoke is very dangerous. Furthermore, cigarettes contain many addictive substances such as nicotine, which are bad for one's health. I know of many family friends who have attained diseases such as lung cancer due to continuous smoking. Smoking can cause so much harm to one's body and one's family (through second-hand smoke and the burden on one's family if one were to unfortunately obtain a disease), so why do people still smoke? Most of the time, habitual smokers are those who started from a very young age. For these young people, it's mostly due to peer pressure and the ""cool"" factor. In order to fit in with the ""in"" crowd and be socially accepted, teenagers feel that they need to smoke. Otherwise, they would be left out from the ""cool"" group. Well, this doesn't really make sense, right? But I suppose you wouldn't understand unless you were in the teenager's position. ",B1
"As a part-time nurse, this question really strikes home, because I've been doing it for a long time. I've been working as a part-time nurse ever since I was in college, and it has already been a great experience. It is really satisfying to see how your work can help others, and it is really great to see the smile of a family when one of their loved ones becomes well. Similar to this, I'm sure that there are many perks to other part-time jobs, and different students will find different pleasures from different endeavors. For me, I was lucky enough to find a good husband who brings in most of that income in our household, so I don't really have to worry about having a fulltime job. If I had not met him, I would probably have been much more motivated to finish my degree and find a full time gig so that I could support myself. This goes to show then there are a variety of individuals in the world, and each individual's situation is so unique that it is difficult to make a broad or all expansive judgment that will hold true for everyone. This is another way to say that the student should decide for himself or for herself if a part-time job is a good way to spend their time.",C2
"Going through college is an integral part of life. It is part of the process one goes through in acquiring knowledge and experience in order to face life's circumstances. In living the college life, students are gradually trained to become actual citizens of the country wherein they practice their chosen profession. However, is it important for college students to have part-time jobs as part of their training? I don't think so. Although part-time jobs may indeed serve as a training ground for students before they become real professionals or workers, I believe that it is not necessary at all for students to be involved with these jobs while studying. Working in these jobs may only divert the student's time and attention away from their studies, especially for the freshmen. Fresh from the high school system, first year college students are still in the process of adjusting their time management. Aside from that, working while studying will be especially hard for those students studying in a trimestral system. I also believe that the opportune time will come when students are given the chance to practice their learned concepts at school. The opportune time that I am talking about is the on-the-job training program that students will undergo on their higher years during college. Even though I don't consider part-time jobs as a significant part of college life, I am not against it. If the students can handle their time and can benefit from these jobs such as earning additional income, they may work in part-time jobs.",B1

"I agree with this opinion. There is one reason. We should think that restaurants are the place where we eat foods with our family or friends talking with pleasantly over once more. Also all of us should want to eat foods which are delicious. But we can't eat the foods by allowing smokers to smoke in restaurants. For example, when I eat the foods with my family pleasantly and the smoke comes, I won't eat pleasantly by the delicious smell was drowned out by the smell of smoke. Actually I experienced the situation like this. When I entered one restaurant with my family, there were only seats in the smoking section. We were forced to sit down seats in the smoking section because there were few times when we looked for another restaurant. Foods had brought. Then the guests who sat around us hadn't smoked yet. When a few minutes had passed, some of them started to smoke. Just then, I smelled the disagreeable odor of the smoke in spite of that I ate delicious foods. And my parents felt loathing for the odor. After that we couldn't eat pleasantly and with good taste. I think there are lots people who have ever experienced like this. In conclusion, I think as long as restaurants are the place where we eat foods pleasantly with good taste, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1

"I agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because restaurants may be full of some no-smoking people. If there are people don't smoke, smoking in the restaurants is a big problem for us who don't smoke. And smoking is bad for health and mood; I don't want to smell the smoke when eating something delicious. Once when I was eating at a restaurant with my family happily, the neighbor just took out a cigarette and began smoking. That smell really shocked us down, we started cough again and again and couldn't talk anymore. We started eating quickly as fast as possible thinking about to get those people away. After we left the restaurant, we finally felt comfortable and started chatting again. After that horrible accident, I totally agree with that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Another example is my close friend, Dennis, who was an athlete at high school. I felt sad for him because he began smoking after graduating. His health had a big problem when he found that his every breath was becoming more and more difficult. ""You had better quit smoking if you want to live longer, "" the doctor told him. I agree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not all people like the smoking smell. Furthermore, Smoking is bad for health and is bad for mood when eating, too.",B1
"So familiar are we with the negative word smoking that people throughout the world expect to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants. As we know that tobacco is a very special kind of air pollution. Cigarette smoke highly toxic pollutants in the oil, and variety. It is estimated that smoke in the oil contains at least 750 species of chemical composition. The main components are nicotine, tar, and carbon dioxide, etc., but nicotine is so highly poisonous a substance that only the nicotine in 20 cigarettes can be deadly. It is widely accepted that smoking in public places, especially in restaurants can never be appropriate at all. Since smoking is a self-battering process, how can smokers go so far as to drag away witnessing others' lung diseases in the future? Those who sit by smokers may complain in private but hardly interrupt them out of manners. It seems that a comprehensive law concerning this problem should be put forward as soon as possible. In some districts in this country, some restaurants have already set up a nonsmoking zone. Nevertheless, far more efforts are to be made. Apart from the law, it is also necessary to improve citizens' awareness of the harmful effect smoking in public may bring to us. In a word, banning smoking completely in restaurants or other public places is the tendency in a highly developed country.",B1
"I agree with this statement. Because smoking is the murder as well as the suicide. When one smokes, people around him have greater possibility for cancer and other diseases. Who says it is not the murder? Of course those who do the murder at the restaurants are to be banned. And the penalty for it is very strict. Why smoking is excluded from the murder? In addition to this, smoking is the suicide. The suicide is the murder for oneself. It must be strange to tell the suicide from the murder. These are the same as ""right"" war. In the world, right war is impossible because it is nothing but violence. The violence can't be right. And smoking can't be right, too. That is, the war is direct violence, on the other hand, smoking is'indirect'violence. But according to the custom, these are acceptable. The murder and the suicide at the restaurants could exist. It must be strange. In addition to this, Japan is democratic country. Democracy can't go with the violence. And Japan can't have any weapons which hurt oneself or others. It is clear that tobacco is a weapon. So we should ban completely smoking at all the restaurants in the country.",A2

"My view on this topic will be that of an extremist's. Firstly, I condone smoking --- the negative effects on a smoker's health, the detrimental consequences on second-hand smoke --- and secondly, I detest inconsiderate behaviour. When a person smokes in public within reach of other people who do not smoke, this person brings a greater impact on the innocent bystanders. By this, I mean to place an emphasis on the fact that second-hand smoke is more toxic than first-hand smoke. Such people who smoke in the presence of others knowingly are plain selfish. It is a known fact that most restaurants are air-conditioned. In such an environment, the smoke will be contained and its effects are amplified. This will definitely irritate other diners. Furthermore, should diners want to smoke, they should leave the premises and go somewhere else to smoke. Thereby not causing anguish to the other diners who paid to have a good meal. Next, some diners who smoke may argue that it is their ""right"" to smoke wherever they like, and whenever they like. However, my rebuttal to this is that the meal is such a short one; possibly an hour or more. So these smokers should be able to control their urge to smoke. If they really cannot resist taking a puff or two, they are certainly too addicted and should consult a doctor. By completely banning smoking at all restaurants, healthy living is promoted. Also, if smokers have fewer premises to light up their cigarettes, then they may have greater incentive to quit smoking --- should they feel unwelcomed. ",B1
"We know that smoking is always banned in all of the place actually. Why? Because it has many bad risks for all of the aspects of our life, even though in the restaurant area in this country. And i think it is done properly. I agree with this statement to ban smoking in the restaurant area. Restaurant is one of public facilities which there are so many people who not at all of them is include to smoker. Many people take their child because restaurant is the place which so convert to getter together. So direct or indirect it can influence of comfortability to visitors. We know there are so many effect if we are include to smoker, bad effect surely. First, the most effect is disturbing the breathing, disturbing the lung, and the most scream is cancer of lung, and so on. So this is one of reason, why the smoking is not allowed in restaurant. But i think, this is not only for restaurant as public facility, but also in other public facility, may be at the market, mosque, church, bus stop, railway station another public facility. Some of the solutions is the owner of restaurant provide a special place for smoker, where at that place only for they who have a smoke. But at sometime, this rule is not followed by some people, they feel lazy to go to the box smoke. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoke and hard punishment for everyone who disobey the rule.",A2
"I disagree to smoking. So I want to show you some my thinks. First, I think you get no merit with smoking. I heard that it has more than 300 bad influents.

The answer is No. Probably you smoke from a filter, but others who are near you, makes to smoke, moreover with no filter. Do you know the influences about smoking to infants or children who are still in mother's stomach? The percentage of children with smoking parents become foolish is much more higher than the children with normal parents. This is second reason. If you want to, or NEED to smoke, You MUST smoke at smoking area. I think it is the least manor for public. And the third reason is the dust problem. I think you have seen many or some dust about cigarettes any where. Cigarettes which are end, boxes of cigarettes, lighter, and so on. Those make bad visual, bad mood, and bad feelings. I cunt believe that those people throw away those dust. In these wards, I disagree to smoking.",B1

"Nowadays in Japan people tend to dislike the tobacco. There are a bunch of places where smoking is prohibited. For instance in hotels, on streets, at colleges and not only in trains but also on platform. So only at restaurants smoking is not banned that is strange. Smoking should be thoroughly forbidden at all the restaurants. One of the reasons is that if many smoking people are in the restaurants, we would feel its atmosphere to be not good. A restaurant is a place where we have a good meal and where we spend time comfortably. Secondly some of customers who come to the restaurants are family. Sometimes the family has the babies. To babies tobacco's smoke is very bad. The restaurants should make visiting all families very happy. So smoking ought not to be allowed. Nowadays the rules of Japan gradually begin to be rigid. But they are not stricter than the rules of Singapore, America, United Kingdom and France. There smoking is almost prohibited. For instance if we are in one of the countries, it is natural that we don't watch a TV commercial. And if we walk there, we would don't look the advertisements on streets.

"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of smokers in recent years. However, smoking is gradually being forbidden in more and more public places. Restaurants, under this circumstance, become most common places for smokers. Actually, some advanced restaurants have already taken measures to prevent people from smoking while having meals. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking does harm both to the smoker himself and people in the neighborhood. It is common sense that smoking is the cause of a series of severe diseases including the lung cancer. What's more, some people around the smoker may be allergic to the smog, which can lead to the unpredictable consequences. On the contrary, if a restaurant is free of the released smog, the air around will be clear enough to enable the people inside to refresh themselves. Furthermore, banning of smoking can largely decrease the possibility of fire. As is known to us all that the kitchen in a restaurant is full of lampblack in most times, which makes it easier to catch fire than in other places. So no smoking means that the security of the people in the restaurant will be better assured. Last but not least, if only some restaurants prohibit smoking while others don't, a phenomenon will emerge that a number of smoker will chooses to eat in a small restaurant where smoking is allowed. This will cause the increasingly worse of the environment in those small restaurants. To conclude, smoking has a bad effect not only on people's health, but also on the environment. Therefore, I hold the opinion that at all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned.",B1

"The opinion, that it is important for college student to have a part-time job, has some merit. There are several reasons why this is a good idea. Firstly, a college education is a significant expense for a college student and their family. Many families do not have the capital to pay the full cost of a college education and thereby have to cover the tuition by taking out a bank loan and in some cases even mortgaging their house or business. This puts a significant amount of strain on the family finances. Therefore, if college students can assist their families with financing, they should. Even if they don't earn enough to help with college tuition, a part-time job can help them pay for all personal expenses or study materials, thereby, reducing the pressure on their parents and encouraging them to become independent, mature adults. Secondly, a significant reason for all young people, including college students, to have part-time jobs is because it is great for the economy. In many countries, including Japan, a large percentage of shoppers are young people. They are the first to take notice of changes in fashion and technology and they often want to buy the latest products, thereby reviving the economy. In addition, when college student are working at local shops their labor cost is low, so shop owners can pass these savings onto the customer. This final point is most important to me.",C2
"I think college student should have a part-time job because of three reasons. First, college students will have more experience except leaning in class. For example the students will know how to work with other people except friends in class, and if you are studying in the college that are in time that you should prepare yourself before go to see the real world. I think work part-time that is a way can help you. Second, college students will know it is not easy to earn money. The students will see a value of money, and they should be aware that how necessary to use money. College students will use money in the right way. Third, it is one way to help their parents to look for the money especially if your family is not so rich, it is important to help them by work in free time. For all of these reasons that are college students will learn more experience, will know the value of money, and help your family to look for money. Thus college students should have special work except learning in class. The best experience is something that you have to know by yourself, so one thing that will give you the best experience is part-time work.",B1
"I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Restaurants include people from all ages, from the young to the old, and they are places for people to eat and enjoy their meals. If smoking is allowed at restaurants, those smokers will pollute the surrounding air. Not only smoking is harmful to the individual himself, it also has an adverse effect on the people near them. In terms of health, innocent parties around those smokers, whom are called second-hand smokers, may become prone to sickness. Furthermore, smoke particles will be left on the body of the first-hand smokers and his surroundings. Thus, if the next person were to be in contact with these particles unknowingly, they became third-hand smokers, which are in fact much more harmful for them. In this case, not just the smoker himself will suffer from chronic illnesses like lung cancer; the blameless parties around him will also be affected. Secondly, the smell from the smoke may be so overpowering that it covered the pleasant smell of the food. Especially in air-conditioned areas, it takes a longer time for the smell of smoke to be dispersed from one place to another. This decreases the happiness level of the customers as they no longer are able to eat with full satisfaction. Lastly, it is to protect the businesses of the restaurants, which in turn helped in the growth of the economy. In the case of Singapore, most people choose to go to indoor restaurants without a smoking corner. In conclusion, for benefits in the long run, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ",B1

Taking up a part-time job is no longer child's play, for their own personal satisfaction. The purpose of schooling is to equip the younger generations with the necessary skills before they join the workforce. College students are at the end of their studying journey and should be thoroughly prepared once they step into the workforce, and to do so, it would be important for them to get a part-time job to learn things outside of the textbook. By getting a part-time job, they get a more in-depth understanding of the nature of the job and not just the theories they learn in classes. Many young graduates hop from industries to industries due to the lack of concrete knowledge and experience in the field. Hence, it would be useful if college students engage in part-time jobs which they presumed they were interested in, to minimise the time they take to find the right job. ",B1
"Today, many college students have part-time jobs. Isn't their job study? What are the benefits for students to have a job? Is having a part-time job so important? I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. First, having a part-time job not only helps students to learn how to social with people live outside their schools and families but also improves their talking skills. That would make them handle things better than others. Meeting varies persons, by the way, would open their eyes. Second, it gives more chances for college students to know how different jobs worked. That will help them to find their interest careers after graduate. It also let students know that earn money isn't as easy as they thought, and won't waste money on unnecessary things. But I only agree students to have part-time jobs in vacations, not during school days. Because college life is so wonderful that everyone should enjoy it, not to use all your free time on works. Students should pay more attention on school works and outdoor activities, such as mountain climbing and beach swimming. Although having a part-time job is important, it is still only a small part of the college life. You'll have whole-life long time for work, so don't be so worried about money now. Enjoy your college life!",B1
"Students need to get some form of employment experience as soon as possible so that they may compete in the marketplace. They would also learn some valuable skills to assist them in making the transition from college to full-time employment. Having a part-time job would give them a little more credibility when applying for jobs and teach them things like organizing their time, responsibility and accountability which are the basic requirements in most jobs. Unless students join the military, they will also require a certain amount of problem solving skills and be able to think independently. Having a part-time job would at least expose them to these areas so that they can see for themselves what is considered to be the normal standard and the minimum level that they would have to function at. Surprisingly, I find that many students are completely oblivious to even the most basic workplace 101 requirements and are in dire need of a reality check. If they had part-time work experience then they would be better prepared to handle the transition from college to work more readily. I also feel that most employers would expect that students had done some form of work or served an internship during their college years and have a grasp of the work environment.",C2
"I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Today many people feel stressed. They have to work from early in the morning to late at night and they have little time to feel relaxed. Some of them may worry about human relations. Smoking in their break time or after work is necessary for them to work vigorously. Let me show you an example. I work at an Italian restaurant. In the evening about 40 percent of customers want to have smoking seats and they smoke while eating pastas. As seeing them, I realize that nothing can make them happier than smoking after work. And people who have non-smoking seats don't seem to mind cigarette smoke. You may say that exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke could cause serious health problems, especially lung cancer. In fact, there is a close connection between lung cancer and smoking. So smoking seats must be separated from non-smoking seats in the restaurants. And smoking people should keep in mind that people who do not smoke hate to be exposed to cigarette smoke. But as long as they follow the rule, we don't have right to deprive them of their pastime. So I am against a complete ban on smoking at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"Take a part time job while we are studying is a good idea and worth to try. First of all, we can earn some money for sure. With that money, we can buy something we like to buy, especially when our parents doesn't want to give the money because their think it is not really important. In other way, we also can keep that money and start learn to give 10% from that money to God, as what He word tells us to do. Secondly, by taking a part time job we will get some skills which are good for us now and then. Actually, we will not have many times when we take a job while we studying, but with the situation like that we will be push to be independent in manage our time and make our life more effective. The experience that we get from the job will be very useful for us someday when we enter the real job world. And the last, we will have more friends beside our friends in school or college. It is very good if us can learn something from the people in our work place like as how to be success. If we want to be success, we have to learn from those people who already be success before us. So, with so many advantages like that, I think have a part time job while studying is a good idea.",A2
"I disagree with this position. First of all, I disagree on the grounds that there is no clear reason to pick on smokers. We smokers do not live in denial of scientific facts, we readily accept that smoking is not a healthy habit (it causes all sorts of lung and respiratory ailments). We are constantly reminded at work and at home that we should quit, preventing us from smoking with our afternoon coffee seems simply petty. I say this as I watch the person at the table next to me (on the other side of the glass wall now used to segregate the smokers) gulp down a massive steak dinner along with a few beers I guess I'd feel better if government went after overeating and overdrinking with the same enthusiasm as they seem to exhibit when persecuting smokers! An finally, I'm certainly not happy with the idea that smoking is bad for everybody (non-smokers included). I own a gun and like to go hunting, I'm very careful about not harming anyone in the process. I behave the same way when it comes to smoking: I make sure that my smoke does not bother anyone If only other smokers were the same way, this would not be such a problem!",C2
"Working students, college students in particular, are not uncommon sights. In the Philippines, maybe not so much, but in some other countries, yes, or at least this is what is being portrayed by the media. Whether or not having part-time jobs is good and beneficial for the students is subjective, dependent on the needs a student has to meet. But regardless of it being beneficial to some, it is not a must â€“ not an extremely important aspect â€“ for students. The main reason for this is that it might, and most probably will, result in the lack of focus on studies. If students involved and busied themselves with part-time jobs, more time will be taken up, there is demand from work separate from that of school, and this builds up to added stress on the part of the students. There is also the possibility of having them prioritize these jobs instead of education. This, of course, is not saying that it is entirely bad. One good thing students can pick up from part-time jobs is learning to balance work and studies, thus becoming more time-efficient. It prepares them for life after schooling. However, as stated earlier, it is not something important or imperative for students to take, especially if it threatens to hamper studies, and also if is not really needed.",B1
"The statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants is a good policy in theory, but in reality there are many people who go to restaurants to enjoy smoking and drinking while eating. Theses people make up a significant customer base for the food and beverage industry. I think that what law makers should do is pass the responsibility of protecting nonsmoking customers onto the restaurant owners. One way to do this is by charging higher taxes to restaurants with poor ventilation systems or without a barrier separation between smoking and nonsmoking sections. I believe that if the restaurant has taken reasonable steps to separate the smokers from non-smokers, then they have done their job to make sure that all customers have a comfortable dining experience. Instead of banning smoking, another way to stem the smoking vs. nonsmoking controversy is to increase in the number of non-smoking restaurants and cafes. At this time many popular cafes, such as Starbucks have had tremendous success with promoting a smoke free environment inside the cafe. As the nonsmoking culture becomes increasingly popular, smokers will find a ways to curb their smoking appetites while dining. Overall, the best way to solve this situation is to give customers a choice.",C2
"The smoke of tobacco has a bad effect on the health not only for those who smoke, but also for those who don't. Nevertheless, there are many people who smoke to relax themselves and they smoke everywhere. It is not desirable that people who don't smoke are harmed by people who smoke. So it is the best way to ban smoking by law. But it is expected that heavy smokers will intensively react against the regulation and the tax of tobacco will not exist if government prohibits that people smoke. In this situation, it is the second best way to separate those who hate the smoke of tobacco from those who like smoking. This idea can apply to the problem whether restaurants in Japan should completely prohibit for the customers to smoke or not. To ban smoking perfectly leads the decrease of customers who want to smoke there. But allowing them to smoke wherever in the restaurants makes the customers from having a meal there. Therefore it is good that the restaurants provide where the customers can smoke and where smoking is banned. In this case, it is important to divide two spaces completely in order to prevent smoke from moving from one space to another space. These effort make both of these type people feel comfortable when they meal in the restaurants.",B1
"A part-time job is important for student. I think the students should do it. Because it is help to student find money. Especially student in the family poor or the parents cannot pay. Because their parents have already cost much. They are help parents to save money by working part- time. Find money for buy book, pencils, pen, papers and other materials for study. In study working part-time is very difficult for student. It must control for good. Otherwise study is very bad. Demand of all student has very much. Because today competition are a lot. Whether it is a matter of personal values that are high in fashion, special Education. It is not enough for expenses. Because of this, it is yonder I have difficulties in daily life. When they are busy working part time that dose not interfere with school hours and activities at work. To find work, it must refer to the remuneration that pleased silk. Finding a part-time job is not easy. If we do not have time to go to work. And do not have money instead of baked. Today is also a part-time work among student to be extremely. Has to part-time job many forms. Depending on which one to choose jobs.",A2
"I agree with this statement. At all of the restaurants I have ever been to there is no wall between smoker's seats and smoker's seat. So I want to explain about only such kind of restaurants. First of all, I want to explain about one reason. Recently in more and more restaurants, smoking has been completely banned in Japan, however there are still two kinds of seats, smoking and non-smoking in one restaurant. I am not the smoker, so I will chose the non-smoking seats. But even if I sit on that seat, I often feel bad because of flowing the smell the smoke. Smell of the segarate is very strong. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, I have ever heard that sub-smoke of segarate is much worse than main-smoke. That means that smoking have a worse effect on non-smokers at one restaurant than smokers. I think it is unfair for non-smokers. I think smoker should smoke out of a restaurant or in one smoker's room. It is fair and reasonable. Smoking is bad for your health. I am sure that we have to discuss good or bad of smoking before thinking about banning smoking at restaurants. That is why I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants all over the world not only in Japan.",B1
"I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, I'm a fresh man in society, and I want to find a job recently. When I mail my work plan or my work experience to employer, but always no answer. I try to find a explain, it's maybe cause my work experience less than other people. Second, part-time job can train personal time management for college students, a lot of college students used to be a super man, it means college students use a half of 24 hour to sleep, play computer, night active, and so on. But they can't spend time to rest, study, or doing something good! Third, part-time job can earn more cash. College students have more and more opportunity to join a lot of party or buy something I like; it needs money to do this. More and more family can't offer much more money to their child now, that perhaps think how to solve this question, and part-time job maybe can be useful!! So I think part-time job can train college students have more work experience, or be independent. So I agree a college student to have a part-time job is important.",A2
"At my country, smoking has been banned at the shopping mall and I really appreciate it. I'm very agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country. I think it's not only at restaurant, maybe also need to be banned at lobby hotel, hospital, church, college and many more public place else. My father is smokers, and I really hate it. For a thousand times I had been telling him to stop, but it's has nothing effect. But fortunately, my father does not smoke at home, or at car when driving. I don't know why people really like smoking and I don't care if they can't stop it, it's ok for me if they smoke at a place where no one there, because I hate to see people smoke at public place around crowd people. Because it is also dangerous for passive smokers, they can get an ill just because they live around smokers people. That's why smoking is really need be banned at all public place at every country in the world. Besides that, the smoke also caused global warming right? So, smoking is also give a happiness to the one who smoke but give a lot of negative effect to the nature and also to the people around them.",B1
"I agree with this statement, it's essential that college students have a part-time job. I have two reasons why I support that statement. First, College student learn that money is important and hard to make from experiencing their part-time jobs. Before going to college, in Korean situation, many students might have never earned money. Most of them may not have certain concept about money. Making money by themselves lets them think about what money is and how they spend the money economically. It helps them to build the concept of economics and to learn how important money is. Second, Part-time job is important in that it give the students chances of experiencing society in advance. Before becoming a member of society, they can learn what society is like and how they handle some problems from their part-time jobs. In my case, I had been serving at a restaurant for 6months. From the experience, I've learned that I should behave and talk nicely to my boss although I don't feel like doing it. Also there wasn't an excuse for my mistake even if it's not all my fault. Having a part-time job is very helpful to college student in that that experience makes them shape their economic standard and concept. It helps also them experience society before being a member of a society.",B2
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is the activity of smoking cigarettes of tobacco and is associated with health risks such as lung cancer. Majority of the population does not smoke and most people dislike the odour and smoke from cigarettes. However, to ban it completely at all restaurants is too extreme an action. The concern over smoking in restaurants is due to non-smoking patrons' irritation and discomfort over the smoke while they dine. Dining is supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable affair and their experience would be marred by the activities of smoking patrons. However, to place such a blanket ban on all restaurants would be very unfair to smokers. It is also impractical as smokers would simply move outside the restaurant or somewhere nearby to carry out smoking. This defeats the purpose of non-smoking patrons wanting to avoid the smoke created by smoking. I believe that the onus should be on restaurants, and they should formulate their own policy on smoking. Restaurants could partition their dining area into smoking and non-smoking areas, or not differentiate the area at all, depending on its clientele. For example, a family restaurant would be more likely to ban all smoking activities in its restaurant in consideration of the presence of young children. Conversely, a restaurant that caters mostly to wealthy clients and working class patrons would be more sensitive and tolerant of the activities of their patrons in order to ensure their continued patronage. Ultimately, the action to ban smoking at all restaurants would only be effective if coupled with more stringent smoking policies such as the ban of smoking in all public areas. Otherwise, I believe that such an action should be considered and decided by the involved restaurants. ",B2
"Smoking is a bad disease. It is spread by those people who have lack of education. Today new generation is addict of this disease. The people who have many tension and problems of house and jobs the fall in this habit. Almost all the restaurant and hotels of Pakistan are kept the thing for people, means they wanted to earn more money for their wishes and for their children and house needs. Today this habit is spread fastly in the cities and villages. The big cities people used the smoking as a fashion. Mostly people run for their worries and the understand that the smoking is the solve of their problems and they daring smoking. It is small villages it is not common but in the big countries the smoking is make habit of the people of college students and worry man. The police is also involve in this bad work. The smoke doing person do not think clearly. He has no think of his future. He destroy the feelings of his family. If he wanted to done something for his family he does not do so. Because passing of the time his mind would be manage and he could not work like a healthy man, who has no addict of smoking. Through the smoking the bad disease are spread every where e. g cancer disease, lungs and brain disease, so, he does not think clearly.",B1
"As far as I am concerned, it is very important for university students to have a part-time job. The reasons why I argue are as follow. In the first place, you can apply the knowledge you learnt in the classroom to practice if you have a part-time job. Secondly, it will be a good chance for you to improve your soft skills, such as communication skills and time management skills, when you do the part time job. This can, in return, enhance your study back at school. Absolutely, this will benefit you a lot when you really find a job after graduation. Besides, you can earn the allowance from the job, which will lighten the financial burden from your parents who support your study. What is more, gaining working experience while studying in university, you may find jobs after graduation more easily. Some people may disagree that they believe having part time jobs will result in worse academic performance at school. I think, however, this is not the case. Multi-tasking is what we definitely will encounter when we join the society after graduation. Instead of escaping from the challenge, it is better for us to practice as soon as possible.",B2
"Part-time work is undertaken by a wide variety of people. Students during holidays frequently do part-time work to get extra pocket money. Many are motivated to purchase something for themselves like a new game or gadget while others do so because their parents do not give them pocket money during the holidays. Adults or students who are studying full or part time may also work part-time to get enough money to pay the tuition fees or other living expenses. There are also adults, the elderly especially, who work part-time to pass the time. A full time job requires too much commitment for these folks so a part-time job is ideal. These individuals are not very motivated by the money earned as most would have enough savings. Part-time work may also be applicable to graduates who are unable to find a desired full-time work because of a bad job market. During bad times, there would be graduates from polytechnics or universities who are qualified for and desire a full-time job but are unable to find one. Part-time work would be a good option for them as firstly it would help to pay the bills. Moreover, it would make his or her CV look better compared to it having a long period of time where the individual is unemployed. ",B1
"The craze for smoking is increasing in Pakistan very rapidly. Even that all the smokers know the side effect and disadvantage of smoking. And now its becoming too fashion. Mostly the young guy age of 18 used cigarette for look of stylish and becoming fashionable. But they are not understood properly the side effects. Its too seen that a physically and mently a tired man use cigarette for relaxation of mind, and he nervously desire for it. but in actually it effects our mind adversely. Now I come to the point. Now in a day's trend becomes to do lunch, dinner in restaurant. Most of male goes restaurant for meal. As we know all of that the smoke of cigarette is too bad for our health. Even we did not smoking but the smoke of cigarette badly attacks on our health. During eating meal at restaurant often people used cigarette after meal for digest but in actually they calling their death. And by this smoke other people those are mealing over affected.

"I agree to this opinion. Some people say that college students have to study more if they have a time to do a part-time job. Of course, it is true that there are some students who remain in the same grade by playing all the time with their earned money. However, there are three reasons for my opinion. First, having a part-time job tells them a real society. Most college students have had little time to enter in a society. By working, they have a chance to know how to communicate with customers, how to speak formally, and so on. That is a very valuable experience. Second, they know the importance of money. They have been brought up preciously by their family, and use their allowance freely. So, they must know how hard earn money by working themselves. They would thank for their parents to raise them until now. Finally, they can challenge various things. Although college students have much free time, most of them can't do what they want to because they don't have enough money. By getting a lot of money, for example, they can watch a baseball game, go abroad to see a different world, and so on. They could enjoy their college life very much. Therefore, college students should do a part-time job. That is useful for their future.",B1
"I agree with the following statement ""It is important for college students to have a part-time job. "" I have some reasons why I agree with this statement. First of all, to have a part-time job teaches us the real value and importance of money. Before I started a part-time job, I got some money off my mother and my ground mother. And I bought books and clothes I wanted with the money. Then I sometimes bought something I didn't really need. But after I started a part-time job, I came to buy something I really needed carefully. For I learned how hard earning money was. I felt the money I earned by myself was very valuable. Secondly, to have a part-time job gives me a lot of experiences. I work as a part-time teacher. And I teach not only junior high school students but also primary school and high school students. Other part-time teachers are many kinds of peoples. They are college students, women who have children and men who got married. Therefore I communicate with many kinds of people. And I learn wide views from them because they have their own views different from mine. Thirdly to have a part-time job improve the way how to use limited times. I must do many thing-studying, listening to rock music, reading books, housekeeping, communicating with my family, and a part time job. So I came to plan by myself. And I always do something I must do now. For these reasons I agree with the following statement ""It is important for college students to have a part-time job. "" And I'll have many kinds of part-time jobs from now on.",A2
"I agree with this subject. Many students work part-time in order to enjoy school life. Enjoyment differs from student to student. That is playing with friends or getting to a license or saving or paying for one's hobby. But some student can not get credit because they work part-time. They lose sight of original purpose. Some parent opposes this subject because of this. Money that student earn in school life is little. When students become a member of society, they earn same money soon. So they should pay money that they earn soon. Money to pay in school life is difficult from money to pay in society life. I know student who pay school fee. *** University is public university, but this school fee is never cheap. This price is seven hundred thousand by year. For students, this price is very high price. So he always works part-time. When I think him, I think students who can spend school life without working is rich. Some students need not work, but some students need work. Some students are rich, some students are poverty. Because in university students have various circumstances, I think students work part-time without losing credit should be permitted.",B1
"Smoking is a personal habit, which must not violate the others' rights for clean air. Especially in restaurants people want to enjoy their meals in relaxed atmosphere and spend good time. While non-smoking customers are having their meals, the smoking customers should think of others' right to enjoy their time and meals as more important ones than smokers' rights in this case. Because only when one does not violate the others own rights, he can claim his own right. In many coffee shops in Korea, there are many special cells for smoking people, which have tables and chairs. The coffee shops want to protect non-smokers' rights to be separated from the smokers and also satisfy smoking customers at the same time. However, whenever the smoking customers enter and leave the cells, the smoke comes out of the cells and the people outside of the cells can smell the foul scent. It still limit non-smokers' rights for clean air. So I hope the restaurant not to choose the same policy as the coffee shops now have. I want the restaurant have strict policy about smoking in their restaurants in order to protect non-smokers' rights.",B2
"First attention of student should be to pay head on its studies so, that he can get better position in this society which there are some financial problems due to which student are compelled to earn for this expenses. In this way they can neither study nor work properly. As parents are responsible for their being these. They should equip them with the problems of life. It is the responsibility of parents to provide their children with every facilities of life which they require at that age. But in our society due to financial pursue, they are compelled to do jobs. As a result they fail and can not show better result in their studies. The students of higher secondary level in comparatively backward areas in the world do part time jobs, but this activity interferes their study. They have to work hard enough. This interferes their health. This is good fact in a way because in this way their education will continue and they can get good jobs after their education. And this facts is bad in a manner, because they can not get rest or spare time for enjoyment their lives become dull and boring. They feel burden after working. And they can not concentrate on their studies. They are the future leaders of the country and nation.

"Smoking is a habit or the part of our daily routine. Here our means a specific person who smokes. Actually what happened in smoking? I am goanna to tell you, what I knew. According to the research, the people who become the victim of smoking are mostly the teenager. They are influenced by the smoke. It seems to them, that their smoking attracts the attention of other people. They think that their personality becomes more attractive. But here the problem is those people are destroying themselves as well as playing which the lives of others because they smoke mostly in parks, restaurants. These all are the public places. At these places, if smokers come, due to smoking other people who are eating these are disturbed. Smoke is not only hatful for smoker but also for other people living around him. This smoke contains toxic and handful substrate like nicotine which is toxic for human health. In restaurants and coffee shops many young smokers also come and after smoking they start making mischievous and their presence effects the families who come here.

"Public smoking is becoming an issue that is widely discussed at all levels. This is because of the higher awareness of the negative impacts of smoking including damages to personal and other people's health, high cost of cigarette, large restriction of smoking areas that made smoking inconvenient and sometimes, social isolation. As far as smoking in restaurant is concerned, it should be completely banned primarily due to health concerns, regardless of whether the restaurant is in an air-conditioned environment or an open Al Fresco concept. Although smoking areas have been demarcated to allow smoking activities in some dining areas, the fact that air circulates will transport the toxic smoke particles to non-smoking area as well, thereby causing irritation to other diners. It is proven scientifically that inhaling second hand smoke is much more dangerous that the actual smoking itself. Besides that, there is also the third hand smoking, which refers to smoke particles sticking on clothes, or food, which eventually gets into a person's digestive or respiratory system. Another reason why smoking in restaurant should be banned is that it will affect other diners' dining experience. Smell is an important factor that affects the enjoyment of food. If the cigarette smell is so strong, it not only covers the natural aroma of the food, but also adds on to unpleasant cigarette stench that can possibly turn away customers. It is therefore important to ban smoking completely in all dining areas, especially in restaurants where consumers pay a higher price for better dining experience. This is the only way to do justice to non-smokers as they reserve the rights to enjoy clean air. ",B1
"When talking about smoking, I see many people smoke around in everywhere. At train stations, bus stations, public telephone, markets, many smokers are there. In the restaurants can be seen smokers also. I don't see any advantages of smoking. If they say, smoking can stop their stress or can make them feel warmer, it's really unreasonable. Thailand is very hot, why smoking? Not cold at all. To release or stop stress? There are many ways to stop that. You may drink juice or work out, or do simple thing such as watch TV or sleep. Restaurants are places to eat and have fun with family or friends. It's for eating so the place should be clean and fresh. The smell of cigarettes can harm people who don't smoke and destroy the air in the restaurants. Food may be bad smell and the tastes become not tasty. Many kids and women or old people in the restaurant might have some effects from the smoke. The restaurants must ask smokers to go outside or ask them to leave. If they wish to smoke, the restaurant may provide smoking area for them but I don't support that. So smoking must not allowed in all resturants.",B1
"Smoking in Restaurants should be Prohibited Food is one of the basic needs of an individual in order to survive. One way to satisfy this need is through restaurant which prepares and serves food and drinks to people. But nowadays, some of the restaurants in the country are not only for eating, it become also a place where people are free in smoking which should not be tolerated because smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker, it is a public health hazzard. We all know that smoking has several effects on human health which are serious and in many cases, deadly. First, the ingredients in cigarettes can cause internal malfunctioning of organs up to the inefficiency of the body's immune system when somebody inhaled the smoke of it. Those who inhale second-hand smoke on a regular basis have the same risks as smokers. Moreover, there's also a cancer-causing agents (carcinogens) in tobacco smoke that damage important genes that control the growth of cells, causing them to grow abnormally or to reproduce too rapidly. Furthermore, smoking may also increase the risk for respiratory infections when the smoke is inhaled. Lastly, it can affect the impression of every customer towards the restaurant, because cleanliness and proper hygiene is very important component in attracting more consumers. Some people give more importance on the cleanliness than the quality of food. That's why I strongly believe that smoking in public places especially in all restaurants in the counrty should be banned.",B1
"In the Philippines, almost one-third of the population is composed of marginalized citizens.

As a result, marginalized children only had the opportunity to complete their primary education in public schools. These children don't have the chance to pursue their dreams further because there are only a few public universities or colleges in the country. That's why it is significant for these students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs offer a number of benefits to college students. On one hand, college is considered to have the priciest cost in terms of tuition fees in the country. Thus, in order to help lessen the expenses of the supporter of the student, this undergraduate should engage in part-time jobs. Even though part-time workers don't earn a lot of money, at least there's a reasonable amount that can subsidize the student's expenses such as school projects. On the other hand, part-time jobs give college students experience. Since college is supposedly the preparatory period before engaging in a profession, the experience that the students get from part-time jobs help them visualize the different workloads they might encounter after they graduate. Therefore, these students gain more knowledge hands-on. Some students might regard part-time jobs as a waste of time and a hindrance from concentrating in their studies, but in reality, part-time jobs are just what college students need in order to be prepared on the kind of labour that awaits them after they graduate.",B1
"The issue of banning smoking in all restaurants is one of the hardest topic need to solve in the whole world. For those who are not smoking always argued that we must ban smoking in all restaurants. One of the most important reasons is secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemical which are known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. All of them are common diseases and kill a lot of people in the world. They said that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke and it must be ban. However, there are some voices came out and argue that smoking cannot banned in all restaurant, like restaurant manager. They are afraid that it would hurt business and it is difficult to control. They think that if there is no smoking allowed, some smoking customers may not come to the restaurant again. Moreover, there are many arguments occur when the restaurant waiters try to dissuade a customer not to smoke. The restaurant waiters do not want to be hard to the customer even if they have the right to stop the smoking customers. They do not want to hurt the relationship between the restaurant and the customers. In my point of view, I agree banning smoking in all restaurants. In addition to the secondhand smoke, smoking has no advantages and what I am try to say is even banning smoking in all restaurant is not about taking away a smoker's rights. You will still have the right to smoke in your own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with.",B1
"I agree with this statement extremely, because smoking can harm other people who can not smoke. The restaurant is a place to have food, be relaxed, and also get fresh air, so a person who needs to smoke should not go there. I think every country has a rule to stop this behavior, but some people who can not stop smoking could not do it. The restaurant should have the rule about PLEASE DO NOT SMOKE HERE in every corner. Although, there are more people against this rule but it is the rule that every people should strongly do it as normal. The restaurant is a public place where people are willing to go there. If a person who need to have a cigarette he/she should go out of that restaurant and smoke at his/her own house. Smoking is the bad behavior that can cause any problem to the person who smoke and not smoke. Please beware that it is not the medicine to cure your problem when you can not think or do more work at the urgent situation. The smoking people should think a lot how smoking can cause the problem to other person beside you. It might cause other people to dead.",B1
"Smoking is the most important evil nowadays in world. About 90% boys, men are addicted in this bad evil. Young generation smoke just for a fashion. and then they are addicted and it is not easy to leave this bad habit. Mostly young generation addicted in this bad habit just due to their bad company and bad friends. It is very easy to nip this bad habit otherwise it is very hard to leave. People addicted too much and they become as a chain smokers. It is also a social evil. People do not want sit, talk with that person. It also affects very bad on our health. It destroys our nervous system respiratory system. The people who are smoking get more chances of much disease like cancer, Asthma, inhaling problem and many others. And one other thing is also very important we know very well that Pakistan is suffering under high economic pressure & cultivation of tobacco is not possible in Pakistan so we should import from other countries we pay lot of taxes on that purpose. Our young generation spent lot of money in buying. And waste precious money of their parents. As a whole there is no single benefit of smoking so we should aware of this bad habit.",B1
"I don't think that it was important but I do think that it is important and necessary for all students to do so now, considering the financial mess that we are in. Thanks to the global recession, are lot of people around the world are in serious financial difficulty. In light of this fact, I think that it is necessary for students to get a part-time job so that they may contribute to the economy in some small way. Many students have to work anyway, because their financial situation dictates that they do so. For others, they may not need to work but by doing so, they can also assist with the global economic recovery in a meaningful way and that is of course, by earning and spending cash. We can all play our part in the financial recovery process and the students can also play their roles in the process too. It is necessary and I believe that it will help all of us and not just the college students in that we won't feel like there is nothing that we can do except sit around in some kind of helpless mode waiting for things to get better. The situation won't improve unless we, all of us do something to improve it without just relying on governments to get us out the mess we find ourselves in.",C2
"Nowadays, many people like smoking. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but we can see people smoking almost everywhere. So it is very common to see people to smoke in restaurants. Many non-smokers hate it. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are lots of people hate smoking in public places have to suffer from second-hand smoke. So forbidding smoking at all the restaurant in the country is necessary. Smoking directly contributes to a large number of diseases, such as lung cancer. People like smoking have higher probability to suffer a cancer. People likes smoking also seems to live a shorter life. Smoking makes the environment in the restaurants bad, drives people into a bad mood and makes people cannot enjoy their delicious food. Smoking can also contribute to lots of accident in the restaurants. Lots of fires are caused by lighted cigarette butts, such fires always cause bad injure and big financial lose. So, we would better not smoke in order to live a better life. And to make other people don't get influenced, we need to stop smoking in the restaurants too. And smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"Personally I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reason behind is because college students are mature enough to earn their own pocket money for their own expenses. By earning this tiny little bit of pocket money, it is able to lessen the burden of the parents or they might get things that they like on their own without depending on their parents. Besides being able to get something that they like by themselves, they are also able to gain experience. Experience is something that is a value-added element to a fresh graduate! Academically good is a very normal phenomenal in this century, when you walk down the road 9 out of 10 are graduated from university. So what's the thing that can make you outstanding from the rest? ""Experience"" is the key to differentiate you from the others! With ""Experience"" you are able to do things more efficiently and faster compared to those who are new and they need time to pick up certain skills or knowledge about the job. Experience also help you in making important decision in your life as these tiny little experience you gather it might be able to make a very big different in your life. ",B1
"I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When someone is allowed in a restaurant, other non smokers' rights are hurt. Someone might claim that smoker has the same right to smoke as the nonsmoker has the right to do not smoke, but someone's right can be justified when it doesn't hurt another's right. It means that someone's right is confined until it doesn't intrude another's right. In these days, the restaurants usually divide the sections, one section for smokers and the other for nonsmokers. However, although they divide the sections, the smokes are easily escaped from the smoking area to nonsmoking area. It really bothers to the nonsmokers who don't want any smokes while eating their foods. Yesterday I went to the Seoul National University subway station to eat dinner with my boyfriend and we decided to eat chicken. We got into the restaurant and started to eat dinner, and suddenly I smelled smokes. Looking around, I found the guys next our table smoked, and then I was really annoyed from that moment. The chickens suddenly seem not delicious, and I just felt I wanted to go out there. In my opinion, there might be lots of people who experienced unhappy mood during the eating because of the smokers in the same restaurant. Therefore I would be grateful if the all the restaurant in the country completely ban the smoking.",B2
"These days, many college students have a part-time job because of their school fee, allowance, or experience. I think it is important that college students have a part-time job for any reason. The most important reason is if they get a job after graduate school, students who had a part-time job are better at social life than students who didn't have a part-time job. I had a part-time job when I was a sophomore during summer vacation. My job was ticketing so I deal with lots of people every day. It was so exhausted and too hard. I wanted quit the job at that time but I endure at the end. I think it's very good experience for me. If I don't have any job experience, and get a job after graduate, I just quit work even I have a little difficult. Therefore it's good experience to have a part-time job for their social life. Another reason is for self-reliance. High school students are just teenager but college students are adult. Adult is old enough to be on their own. They feel more good themselves if they earn their allowance than they depend on their parents. Therefore I absolutely agree that college students have a part-time job if it doesn't affect their study.",B1
"I disagree this statement that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. I have two reasons for this. First, restaurants are where people have dishes with relaxing. All people have right to enjoy eating. Of course, smokers aren't exception. They deserve to smoke after eating. Nobody can disturb their leisure. Indeed, smoking harms human's health. For example, smoking causes lumber cancer, pulmonary emphysema etc. That's not all. Tobacco's smoke is poisonous for surrounding people who don't smoke. The room's air is becoming dirty and stink. But these problems are solved if seats are separated for smokers and non-smokers. Smokers understand smoking's damage and select smoking. Non-smokers need not get secondhand smoking. That is, not at all the restaurants but at part of the restaurants, smoking should be banned. And second, if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, the number which smokers go to restaurants will be decreasing. That's because they will come to eat where they can smoke, for example, at home or at office. Reduction of customers has a malign influence upon profit of restaurants. Since the food service industry support Japanese economy, Japanese economy will be dealt a heavy blow to and may fall into disorder. In a word, the policy isn't good. Arguments for and against smoking should be decided by each people. Tobaccos are taste for some people. It shouldn't be banned unnecessarily. That's why I don't support the statement.",B1
"The case of smoking is become a big conversation among people in the world, include Indonesia. In this case of should government ban smoking in restaurant?, Indonesia create an extreme debut actually smoking can be a great problem and also can be a great luck. Just think about both of these controversial there are many people that agree with the banning of smoking in certain place like in this case restaurant and there are also many people disagree about it of course it because of the advantages and disadvantages of smoking. Can said that government shouldn't ban smoker to smoke in restaurants because it will decrease the money income. This statement is excellent but think about it first, actually government has banned smoking in several places such as public transportation, public places, place for kids, place for prayer and restaurant are belong to public place means that people can not smoke in these places and the logic thinking that we can use is if the government ban the smoking in these certain places so that the government has thought deeply about the cause and effect of smoking it self. it also mean that smoker still can smoke except in these four place include restaurants. By banning smoking in restaurants government carry away human right, there must be many smokers lovers want to smoke in every places they stand of course in restaurant but in other head think about smoking unlover, they are furthermore for restaurant that use AC the smoke of cigarette cannot regulate well and it really disturb and sometimes make a dangerous effect.",B1

" I agree the opinion that college students should have a part-time job. I have three main reasons to support my ideas. Firstly, we have much spare time in our college life, and how to make use of this part of time make a great difference. If we only do the scientific or literal work in our spare time, we will become indifferent to the work and lack of practical experience which will make us stay at a low situation in the social competition. In addition, lack of work experience will always keep us from the society like a mist. It's competent to do a job in the enterprise if we had similar experience. Secondly, during the period of part-time job, we can get acknowledge of the companion in the company. And these people can do a great help to our way to be qualified, and the relationship will be a key to our application for the job. Last but not the least, experience of part-time jobs can also make us have some pocket money. Though the amount is not important to us, the feeling of managing the money we earned by ourselves is helpful to our experience of management. Above all, It's of great importance and essential for us to have a part-time job in college life.",B1
"As a college student, you could work part time job after finish class, part time fob can earn wages and this wages you spend your time and vigor, all about wages is made by yourself, so do some part time jobs are the necessary thing in the university life. In the long vacation and weekend, more college students find the part tome job, part time job can earn money and learn some about how to service customer. For example, if you service more people, you would have more experiences, and then if you find other job, experience is your important advantage to promote yourself. This experience is not teacher teaching that you can learn. And on the other way, part time job is a way to steel yourself, all things you need to arrange, like which time you can work, if you will exam, you should go to work? Your wage how you use, save or buy what you want? You must be made the best way to arrange there problem. However, no matter what, students shouldn't be affected the school work by the part-time job. Also, it should never be allowed that students work at some illegal works. Find the legitimate work is the more important that you must do.",B1
"Smoking has long been considered to be bad to our health while still there are so many people who can not get rid of it. What's worse, people around the smoker will suffer. So I do approve of the policy that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is our common sense that smoking shortens our longevity. Any one who wants to live happily and healthily in his older ages needs to stop smoking. Banning it in public places warns smokers of cigarettes' health-damaging effects and gives them less chances of smoking. And it ensures them a healthier life. Better still, non-smokers in restaurants can get a relief from the worry that there would be a heavy smoker fill the air with bad-smelling, health-affecting smoke. They will surely have a better time eating in the restaurants. Restaurant owners benefit from the policy too. No smoker there always means less conflict between customers. It also makes restaurants a more welcome place. Cleaning is much more easier when they do not have to deal with the smoke, cigarette ash and snipes. So it is a win-win game for smokers and non-smoker, customers and restaurants. Why not implement this useful policy to our society as soon as possible?",B1
"Part-time job is a good one to get money it is not hard work. Almost everyone can do it, we can make more money and we don't have to ask our parents for money. I think it is a good one for college students. It's a good job for college student because it does not have to work in class time, and the most important one is we can help decrease our parents' expense. Part time job is just a part of college life, we have to pay attention in class belong with the part-time, it would be the best. People who tend to get the best job more than other people are people who have more work experience. Due to human responsibilities, students who study in a university should already have abilities to live by themselves. That is they should do a part-time job. When they graduate from the university, they have to find a job. Therefore, while they are studying in the university, they should have a part-time job to train them before getting the job in the future. Moreover, having opportunity to have a part-time job while they are studying in the university is a good chance to get a job in the future. Many managers want people who have work experiences to work in their company. As a result, if the students have experiences about the job while they are studying in the university, it will help them a lot to get a good job in the future. Additionally, they can help their parents to save find and money while they are studying in the university. So, I agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.",A2
"Smoking, one of the vices Filipinos are largely engaged in, is one of the main factors which cause death in the Philippines. In order for the people living in the Philippines to have a healthier lifestyle, laws on smoking bans have already been enacted but not yet strictly implemented in all the parts of the country. It may also cause addiction which is an effect of smoking that is hard to avoid. What does smoking do to the lives of the people who are addicted to it? Banning of smoking must be implemented at all the restaurants here in the Philippines because not all Filipinos like the smell of the nicotine that is being emitted through smoking. It must not only be banned at the restaurants, but also in all parts of the country. Smoking is bad for the health, and is as bad for those people who are the receivers of the smoke being emitted by the main smoker. Smoking causes lung cancer, bad breath and other side effects that are bad for the health. If a person smokes at the restaurant, the smoke being emitted will be transferred to the food being cooked in the restaurant. This will then be eaten by the people at the restaurant which in turn will make them sick. Inhaling the smoke from a cigarette is bad for the health, and is as bad as drinking of alcoholic beverages.",B1
"Yes, it is important to have a part time job for the college students because they will know how to manage their time in their studies and in their work. It really helps a lot to the parent who is always giving to us the money to pay our tuition fee and our allowances for the entire months. But if you have a work you will learn the importance of money and some of the students they will have their own savings for their everyday expenses. You will able to distinguish if you really need to buy that thing or not. In this case you will be able to control yourself buying the thing which is not important to you because you know that to yourself it's just a waste of money and your time as well. For example your professor gave you a task which is thesis writing you will able to print every pages of it and you also need to be hardcopy don't ask for your parents instead use your money for that project to be able to accomplish the task that the professor has given to you.

"I extremely agree with the topic, don't you want to lost your nice feeling while sitting in the restaurants just cause by the smoker? Surely, most people in this planet think about themselves more than the others. So that is the cause to have nowadays crime. In the restaurants, there are many signs about ""Don't Smoking""; you can see them in all of the poles and in the walls there. Banning about smoking in the restaurants must be having an extremely taboo for in first time, I think. How we can do it? At first, Have enough security guards, then show the sign note ""Don't Smoking"" and follow with ""Fine (the most expensive pride) on one cigarette"" Do that together with when someone or some people against that sign, Call the security guards to manage on them. If every restaurant can do that, nice feeling that leads someone going to go to restaurant where is the place for meeting with old friends, for dinner in the great time with the family, for celebrating with the victory, for dating with beautiful girl and nice boy, and especially for relaxing yourself with the great meal for charting energy in your body to doing your job excellently.",B1
"College studies are quite tough. Every subject takes at least two hours if being read daily. A student who wants to excel should have his mind face of other matters, anxiety and worries, peaceful environment and conditions applying studies help students get good marks. Now days necessities are touching the sky and every family can't afford their children education, but poor parents get their children admitted an Govt. schools. When these children reach college studies they find their parents living from hand to mouth which specifically that their parent's expensive college studies. So, they start part time job to fulfill their stationary needs. This is terrible for their health as well as their studies. These students become weak day by day due to long working hours of part time jobs. It therefore become impossible for them to pay attention to their studies and ultimately they lose the race. On the other hand there are those students who are not poor but they want to live independently so they find part time jobs. These students think they mature and engage themselves in long working hours. Certainly they can't achieve their goals because if they want to live independently they should have enough money and they can earn money only through education. This step loses their abilities to research and discover more and in the end they are at a big lose.",B1
"I think that I would agree but unless students get a reasonable wage from their part-time job, it may not be enough and it could very well be necessary to have 2 or more jobs just to make ends meet. In New Zealand, many students are struggling on the meagre earnings that they are currently earning and it is nigh on impossible for them to pay any education fees and have money to live on as well. Many receive no funding from their families at all and if they don't have a job, they may be entitled to some government assistance but even then, it is not enough. It is very difficult for them to study and try to survive if they are the only breadwinner and the drop-out rate has been climbing steadily. I believe that the governmental needs to provide greater support for those students whether that would be by some form of increased stimulus package or monetary payments, I don't know. What I do know is that they need to act fast before the situation gets even more out of hand than it already is. Clearly, these kids want to study but they need to be able to live as well and all they really asking for is just hand up not a handout.",C2
"Pakistan is a country full of color and zest, rich in culture. Our culture's foundation lies in the strong family unit. The sort of bonding we promote, family ties we have are scarce in the west. Here we believe in taking care of our kith and kin. Our cultural norm is that parents support their children all through their life. They raise us, educate us, provide for us, arrange our weddings for us, and then pamper our kids as well. In such scenario, I strongly feel that part time jobs are not fit for our culture, neither for our family units, nor for our society. It is western concept that parents must ask their kids to leave the house and live on their own once they turn eighteen. For them and their youngsters it is necessary that that they opt for part time jobs, earn for themselves. It is inevitable for them and vital for their survival as well. On the other hand our culture is a reflection of warmth. Parents take their kids as small chicks and keep them under their wings, safe from the heat and cold of the world, until they feel that chicks are ready to survive on their own. This generally is never. Since our culture does not enforce any such responsibilities, we do not need any part time jobs. We want our kids to give complete attention to their studies before they begin to worry about earning.",B1
"Agree. College students cannot avoid the reality of the part-time job to think. The biggest reason that college tuition is a problem. College tuition is too high for many students to pay. According to one survey, 73% of the students are planning to work at a part-time job in this summer vacation. Many university students say it's too hard to make money. According to a newspaper article college student's work part-time wages are low. This is also a part-time college students need to break is the reason. Because, if you do not collect enough money to have low wages. A possible solution then, is to lower college tuition. This is a problem now and will be replaced in the future. And, students will increase their hourly rate is also a solution. We will deal with exactly this problem. Ever-increasing college tuition for a student to spend on the street. How much of a social experience as a part-time job, but keep up with the problem of tuition I do not think the poor. Soon as possible to find a good solution should be a healthy college student initiatives. To that end, we all must strive constantly interested. If so, good results soon reinforce.",B1

"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I state the reason now. First!! Use the time effectively! College students comparatively have more free times compared with a member of society. Time is precious if we spend the time wastefully. Therefore, we have a part-time job. By doing part-time job, we get money. We will be able to go shopping and to the movie by the money in next free time. This cycle make the time effective. Second!! Get money that we can use freely. We can buy many things (car, house, jewelry, clothes, bags, plane ticket, and so on) which we want no matter how it is much by the money. Third!! Learn society I think that to learn society is most important when we are at university. To learn society means that we acquire decency and learn communication with seniors or juniors in business. We can do them by part-time job. Surely, a way of learning society is not only part-time job. But, it is the most suitable because it is the nearest to the society on the point of business. Some people may argue that we neglect study. I think so too. But there are many merit of supplementing it. So, I agree to have a part-time job.",A2
" As a matter of fact, I'm just doing a part time job as a fraulein now at weekends. I also get some money from it and feel very happy, because it is the first money I got by myself. As a fraulein, I must face with many kinds of people. I think it is the thing that is impossible to avoid. But in China, there are very little part time jobs for our students. I know, in Japan, university students can do part time jobs not only as a fraulein but also as a waiter, a librarian, even a cook and so on. I think it is the reason why the students in Japan are morn self-support than our Chinese students. In China, many students don't want to do part time jobs because they think it can make them lose countenance. But I don't think so. I think do part time jobs can make our students step into the society, then we will know the importance of study. Knowledge can make us richer than only do jobs with our hands. So I think do part time jobs are very necessary for our university students. I also want to do many kinds of part time jobs to make myself much stronger.",B1
"I don't agree because firstly, there are way too many smokers' opinions in Japan for the Japanese Government to just override and secondly, it really should be up to each restaurant and each person to decide for themselves without Government interference. If I owned a restaurant and I was complying with the standard food and beverage laws, why should the government Japanese or otherwise, come in and tell me how to run my business. What would be next on the agenda, banning karaoke or non-bottled water, only allowing customers in who are wearing pink shoes? A restaurant is usually a private concern and should be left that way if they meet the standard health regulations related to food and drink that I mentioned. The moment that governments start to over-regulate is usually when the problem/s get worse. Apart from kids, adults should be allowed to make their own choices about where they want to eat and the restaurants have the right to allow or disallow smoking on their own premises. That's just a part of fair trade in my view and consumers have the right to let their wallets do their talking by not going to smoking or non-smoking venues/restaurants as they see fit.",C2
"The governments all around the world are imposing regulations to discourage people from smoking. Especially, there is one regulation which is controversial between smokers and nonsmokers. One of the regulations which are debatable is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons supporting the regulation. First, restaurant is a place where people come to have a meal not smoke. Not only smokers but also nonsmokers, especially babies and children visit the restaurant. It is really bad for their health when people smoke. Second, smoking should be banned in the restaurants for its clean environment. When people smoke, the cigarette smoke pollutes the air inside and makes the restaurant murky. Customers will be reluctant to come in to the murky restaurants and want to have a delicious meal in pleasant restaurants. Last, the regulation brings a great benefit to the restaurant owners. They can save replacement costs by not replacing curtain, wallpaper, carpeted floor and furniture often. Also as the fire hazard reduces, the fire hazard insurance premium burden will be greatly reduced for restaurant owners. For these supporting reasons, the regulation should be applied to all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons for it. First, they can learn some social manners by it. Second, they can learn the ability of communication through it. Third, they can understand how hard it is to get some money. The social manners and the ability of communication they learn from it help them when they graduate their college and get their job. The understanding of difficulty of getting some money will make them to thank their parents. Finally college students need a lot of money. For example they need money when they go lunch with their club members or they go shopping. They have to make money by themselves for their enjoyment. Therefore I think a part-time job is important for them. In fact, I will start a part-time job next month. The reasons why I start it is also the above some reasons. Especially I would like to learn the ability of communication and I would like to understand how hard it is to get some money. And I want to use the money I get for shopping. People who disagree to the statement may think that students only have to study hard. But studying on the desk can not teach them some social manners or importance of money. There are many things which are learned only by working.",A2
"I agree with the statement because part-time job gave me lots of experiences. For example, I understood following things through part-time jobs. It is hard to make money because I have to go to part-time job when I promised day and time, even if I don't want it. I have to keep time because if I delayed, I interrupted colleague's jobs and make bad relationships. I can't stay I'm center of the world because guests choice restaurant which they want to go, so I need to make them comfortable for they choose my shop. I learned from part-time jobs how important money and to make money, to make relationship. But I learned it is makes me tired to have job at the same time. I need time to have a rest for recovery. So it is interrupt my study to have too much jobs. I agree with having a part-time job but it is better to work during long vacation like summer or spring. Because student first priority is study and part-time job should not interrupt their study.",B1
"I do not agree smoking in restaurant No, I do not agree smoking in restaurant because smoking can make poor your healthy.

Do not believe the people saying you do not gentlemen because you do not smoking because is very lie and make poor healthy to people. You can believe saying doctor don't smoking because can make poor your healthy.",A2
" Nowadays, plenty of college students would like to find a job on their free time. To have a part-time job, for example, being a teacher who helps senior students with their weak lesson, is becoming more and more popular and even be smart. Before I have got into the university, I once thought that I should get some part-time job on my weekends or holidays because it can strong my will and improve my ability, but things got changed now. I remembered when I was in senior 3, the burden of study was too heavy to hold. At that time, not only parents but also teachers told us if we try our best to be accepted by a ideal college, things will all be fine and the university is the heaven for us and we can do most of thing that we like.. But the fact is opposite, we don't have enough time to do a part-time job, because my free time is made up of studying, variety of activity which we are forced to attend and learning to achieve different kinds of certifications because we need it when we find the formal job. To find a part-time job, I think, time is the first element and we can do nothing without it. I suggest that some boring activities could be canceled and our student could be given more time to do something meaningful, but it need attempt and time.",B1
"What do you think about Prohibiting smoking in Thailand restaurants? In Thailand, many restaurants have an important rule. One is prohibiting smoking. Because the good restaurants should have good vistas for service customers and save customers' health. In my opinion, I agree with a rule of smoking prohibit in all restaurants in Thailand. I think there are three important reasons to enforce this rule. First, this rule makes all restaurants in Thailand have International standard. If every restaurants use this rule strictly, it makes customers impress in good vistas because there is not have bad smells in restaurants areas. These stimulate the customers' appetite and make customers want to come back again. Second, this rule can save customers' health. Because smoking is a risk habit. In addition, in cigarettes have Nicotine. It can make smoker health goes bad. Furthermore, it affect around people's health. It is a main cause of lung cancer, makes smoker's mouth have bad smell, and grow old quickly. Finally, if the restaurants use this rule, they can be good patterns for children who come to restaurants. In conclusion, there are many disadvantages about smoking in restaurant areas. So, I hope you agree that Thailand should have a rule of prohibiting smoking in restaurants with me.",B1
"I strongly agree with this. In my attitude I think smoking is very dangerous because it can damage smokers' selves and people around them. Toxin substances in the cigarette can cause a lot of bad effects to their health such as lung cancer, cancer in mouth, heart disease and gastritis. Furthermore, it will make smokers haven't good personality and outlook. Smoking in the restaurants should be not allowed because the people who are in that area will become second-hand smokers. Second-hand smokers are victims that are damaged by smoke from the cigarettes although they don't smoke. It's unfair. The people will risk if they have a meal in the restaurant that has smoking. In addition to the people will be moody and unhappy when they smell smoke. The smokers ought to smoke only in the areas that are allowed. The restaurants are the public places so smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The most people who don't smoke should not get bad effects with the smokers. There must be strict rules for compel the smokers. If they don't follow, they must be punished. The effects from the cigarette are important events thus we shouldn't neglect.",B1
"Nowadays, more and more people have realized the disadvantages of smoking. Smoking is doing harm to not only smokers themselves but also some relative persons who are together with smokers. Namely, the negative influence of smoking can be passed among all of people. There are so many disadvantages of smoking. So should we have to ban smoking in the public restaurant? Of course not. In Chinese culture, smoking is always taking possession of most part in interacting. People even can't feel a perfect meal without smoking in the end. Maybe it's hard to change the habit formed several years. Besides, smoking is sometimes a way of communicating with others. During meals, some people smoke because they want someone to change the attitudes towards themselves. Some people smoke because they want to improve the relationship between others, while others want to deal with their business efficiently. Taking my family as an example. I have a big family, and of course males like smoking. My grandpa and my father as well as my uncles would smoke when women are cleaning the dishes after dinner. In their views, it's a good way to improve the emotion of families. And we are all used to that. For us, it's really difficult to change that immediately. So it's much better to obey the habit than to break despite of disadvantages of smoking.",B1
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking attacks not only firsthand smokers but also secondhand smokers so at public places like restaurants smokers should avoid smoke. Penalty by government is the most efficient way to have smokers keep social rule. Here are some reasons for this opinion. First, smoking brings bad influence to people even though they are in the same place with firsthand smoker. Restaurants are not a personal place but a public area so many people from young baby to seniors are using. In this place, we should think of other people's health. Second, as we all know the fact that smoking has a lot of bad aspects but, it is very difficult to quit smoke by oneself. I think the public ban is the most efficient way to help them be more careful. I am not saying that all smokers must give up smoking but they should avoid public place, and putting penalty will helpful. For those reasons I strongly say that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, in the public place, smokers have duty not to influence them badly. Second, putting economic penalty is the best way to help them regard the proper place to smoke.",B2
" Being a student in university, we've to manage a large quantity of time rationally ourselves. Many students ride the wave to take part time job after their series of everyday courses, claiming that taking part time job not only values their leisure time but also earn them a good amount of pocket money. However, things don't usually go as what we imagine. Many of them focus more on the job but care less for their courses. As a result, they would fail to pass an exam while earning a good salary. Students work that way just cannot figure out what is more important between courses and part time job. First of all, our students' toughest and most important task is to learn lessons well and get professional knowledge. That is what comes out first as a student. Nevertheless, it is not that we ought not to take part time job, but we should strike a balance between courses and job. Truly, we do have plenty of free time at hand. Pick up a job which is fit for our routine. Maybe the job takes 2 hours in Sunday afternoon, which means it won't occupy the time we need to go over our lessons and put a finger on relevant research into our major. From my point of view, taking part time job is just a way of killing leisure time at hand. Since we are living in our lovely campus, we have more than enough joyous ways of spending time and creating a period of happy memory. If job isn't perfect, why not try another way. In short, let our part time job well value our leisure time.",B1
"We must first understand that smoking is a largely harmful activity, bringing diseases to the smoker and is a nuisance to others. However, many are still addicted to the habit of smoking, and feel the urge to smoke frequently. Banning smoking in all restaurants gives non-smokers a smoke-free environment to dine. For the smokers, however, it means that they will have to either stop their smoking habit while dining, or excuse themselves to find alternative locations to smoke during meals. As smoking is a die-hard habit, the latter is usually more prominent. Additionally, we have to understand the motivation behind banning smoking in all restaurants. Is it because the government wants to reduce the harm that smoke brings to non-smokers? Or is it due to the fact that the government wants to eradicate the habit of smoking in its population by setting up barriers to smoking? If the former is the case, the new law might help, ensuring a smoke-free dining environment. However, if the latter is the case, it might have very limited effects. Ban smoking in restaurants, and smokers will take their smoking to another place. As long as the intention of smoking is there, smokers will find a way to do so, unless if there is a strong barrier set up. Banning in restaurants only is, however, not a strong one. As such, I believe that whether to ban smoking in all restaurants depends on the motivation behind it, and whether there are any complementary policies to support the motivation. ",B2
"Despite of the fact that smoking does harm to health, as is known by almost everyone, there are still many people keep smoking everyday. They often light a cigratte at any place they like, especially in public situation, such as restaurants and so on. I feel really uncomfortable while a person is smoking close to me. Accordingly, I suggest that smoking should be mainly banned at all restaurants in the country. The reasons are as follows. First of all, as is mentioned above, smoking is really harmful to smokers' health and people around them as well. A number of research reports indicate that a heavy smoking is likely to lead to a lung cancer which is a deadly disease for human beings. Banning them smoking at restaurants is an effective way to control their smoking more or less. What's more, if there is no one smoking at restaurants, other customers can enjoy a meal with pleasure in a comfortable environment. In this way, customers may feel relaxed and have a good appetite, which will stimulate the income of restaurants. Neverthless, if some smokers can't bear this rule, we can set up a smoking room for them to smoke. This room must be sealed in case other customers will be troubled by it. These are my general ideas of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. I can draw a safe conclusion that this decision will bring us more good than harm, so we can appeal to our friends to support it.",B2
"I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, smokers cannot eat out and enjoy with their friends if smoking is controlled at restaurants. These days smoking is prohibited at many restaurants and cafes. My family and some friends are also smokers so when I go out with them, we have to search the restaurants where we are allowed smoking. I let them smoke at least when we rest. Surely smokes may be unpleasant for people who don't smoke. However, if so, restaurants have only to part smoking section and nonsmoking section so I think smoking don't need to be banned. Second, if smoking is prohibited, people smoke out of buildings and town become unsanitary. When I went to New York, people smoke on the street because smoking is controlled at almost buildings. Therefore many cigarette butts are on the street. Accordingly that people are allowed smoking in the buildings is better than that street become dirty. By these reasons, I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The best way for smokers and nonsmokers is the way to part smoking area and nonsmoking area. If so, we can choose which area we stay and people who don't smoke also eat and rest comfortably.",A2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job for many reasons. First of all, they need to start their own economy life and having a part-time job is the best way for them to learn the real economy. They can experience the toughness of earning money and learn the value of money. In addition, they can exercise how to plan for using money constructively. Secondly, having a part-time job can teach them to be independent. Until graduating high school, most of the students depend on their parents, especially at economical points. However, they are now all grown-ups and they need to prepare for their own life. Therefore, it will be a beneficiary experience for them. Lastly, being a employee will teach them about the responsibility. Having a job means a contract between a employer and oneself, so it'll give them a duty to do their work properly. Some people would against this idea, because there is possibility of neglecting one's schoolwork. However, I've said above, having a part-time job will promote one's responsibility and independency; therefore, it will also give a good effect on the studying. In addition, they can learn how to plan their limited time properly. Because of heavy schedule, they won't waste their time. Moreover, spending lots of time in front of the desk doesn't equal to having a good grade. They can learn more precious values through this experience and they will grow to be fit people for the society.",B2
Student life is full of excitement and thrill. Some students give full time to their studies to get good marks. Parents of some student can afford all of the expenses of college while others can't. Students who are keen to get food result despite of their poverty are faced to do part time jobs to fulfill their college expenses. The effort is good but causes bad effect on their studies. They could not focus on their studies. For instance a student goes to college daily and after wards it works at a workshop or at a store etc. till afternoon. A human and especially a teen ager become fatigue after all these activities so how could he pay full time and full energy to his studies with open mind. After this clarification it is proved that part time jobs for students are not recommendable. This also affects their result for which they are doing all this. This is the responsibility of the Government and authorities that they should take necessary steps to overcome this situation. Such students whose parents can't bear the burnet of their studies should be awarded scholarships to buy up their aims. They should be back up to pay full attention on their studies leaving behind other actives of life in college. They should be making carefree from these college expenses so that they pay full attention to their studies. Students doing part time jobs are also cock in health. Government should realize that we can't destroy our future by losing the talent of our country.,B1
"Smoking in restaurants must be banned because banned for many reasons despite that it makes you look more sociable and more elite, then it is not a good reason for letting you smoke in a restaurant. It should also be banned because they are being selfish because it's not only their air but also our air. The owner of the restaurant must have his or her own foresight about the restaurant he or she wants to have, from ones satisfaction to one's pleasure and desires. Also, based on my research, the article directly says, However, new evidence shows that second hand smoke is more dangerous to smokers than first thought. A new study was done by the Environmental Health on smokers, who had to smoke in enclosed places. (Source: http://voices. yahoo. com/second-hand-smoke-more-dangerous-smokers-than-5442447. html (11/10/12; 17:02)) They are not just harming themselves, but they're also harming the people around them. Smoking may make you look more sociable and elite, but has it ever come to your ind that there are also other people around you? Smoking may be just for yourself, but have you wondered or crossed your mind about the harm you are bringing to your dear non-smoking companions when you smoke with them? I think smoking must not only be banned in restaurants, but it should also have a high tax around 110% of its original price because despite that it is not healthy, it is also contributing to the worlds litters, pollution and additional destruction of the Philippine streets and environment.",B1
"I agree on working part-time of university students. I have some reasons why I agree on working part-time. Firstly, in university, we can study society with only books. With only books, there are many things that we don't know about real society. We had better really work part-time and understand difficulty of earning money, working with many people, and so on. Secondly, we students needs much money when we do everything. We want to do very funny things that we can not do in school days, such as traveling world, playing with friends, loving girl friend, and so on. These things cost much money, so we need much money. We may rely on parents, but we should live by ourselves as diligent as we can. Thirdly, we had better make friends as many as we can make. It is the most important thing in my life and school life. I suppose that student should not study but make more friends. Friends is more important property than food, water, money and so on. So, we had better part in working part-time, we should much more friends in not only university but also part-time-job. In such ways, let's enjoy school-days and make it very significant thing.",A2
"As we all know, smoking is bad for our health. So some people choose not to smoke. But sometimes even non-smokers are forced to smoke. Yes, that is second hand smoking. So in my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because restaurant is a public place. Most people are for the ban. So am I, and I think it a wise choice. Smoking will do harm to smoker's lungs and cause many diseases such as heart attack and even lung cancer. What's worse, passive smoking may cause worse effects. So smoking in public places is irresponsible to both smokers and people around. For each other's health concerns, smoking should be banned in restaurants. Though most people agree with it, when it comes to exercise, some people still act negatively. Some think it as unpractical because smoking people occupies most of the customers and it is equally important to protect smokers' freedom. But I think starting it from now on is wiser because it makes no sense to leave it alone until the problem become much worse. The government should try to set some regulations that all the restaurant ban people from smoking inside of the restaurant. If they really want to smoke, they can go outside of the restaurant to smoke and it won't influence others.",B1
"The Toss of the Coin If one side of the coin can brand you, which side would you be? In a world where almost every little thing is given attention and judged, it is not hard to imagine how even people themselves, are classified into small groups and niches. No matter how much equality is empowered and believed in, there will always be differences between culture, status, religion, nationality, race, colour, and possibly, every characteristic a person can be grouped into. There is always this barrier of contrasts and somehow, it has even reached and now resides within the four walls of each and every school. Students are easily categorized into twoâ€” the elite and rich kids, and the scholars. The wealthy ones are usually in good schools and can afford not only their needs but also their luxuries in life. They are dependent on their parents so they don't really have to work too hard to finish school. All they have to focus on are their studies. On the other hand, there are those students who hardly even have enough money for all the things they need. They are those who have to work their way up to graduation and yet things won't still be enough. Most often than not, they need to take part time jobs just so they can continue with their studies and finish college. It is not important whether one is rich or one is poor. No one should be branded. Whether a student finishes college because of working part time or not is not the real question to ask. What truly matters is that he attains his goals, reaches his dreams, and makes a difference. So whether you choose tails or heads, it doesn't really count much. Question is do you win the game?",B1
"Smoking are very popular these days. Adults are used to smokes, everywhere and anytime. Sometimes they smoke just because their habit and become addicted, even they smoke at restaurants. In my opinion, smoke should completely banned at restaurants. What factors are influencing for this banning? It is because it can bother other customers, for instance children and women. In the restaurant, there are not only smokers, but also family. Maybe they are going to the restaurant with family, with their children and wife. When they smoke at restaurant, it can bother his wife, and the other customers that don't like smoke. Of course we all know that passive smokers (they who breathe the smoker's smoke by accident) have a higher risk of getting various disease than the active smoker(the smokers). So, when we smoke in a public place, especially in restaurant, we make other customers getting worse. People says that smoke is only for the adults. Yes, we all agree about that. However, in restaurant, there are children too. How can they smoke with children in front of them? This could lead that child looks smoking is cool, and looks very adult, then they do it. This is really a great threat, because we don't want our kids to get sick, because the wrong habit. This is not the child's fault, but the smokers. We have to prevent our child for smoking, at least until they know the risk of it. For conclusion, we should really banned smoking in the restaurant completely. We can try it by giving a suggestion to the smokers to smoke outside. By this small effort, you have one great step to give your child a better future.",B1
"Nowadays smoking is banned in public places in more and more countries. And there is a heated discussion about whether smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Personally, I think it inadvisable to smoke in a restaurant. It is universally recognized that the cigarette contains a considerable number of harmful elements. Smoking may not only do harm to the smokers themselves but also to the people around them. So if a person is smoking while others are eating, the eaters will be greatly annoyed. No non-smokers want to be bothered by cigarette smoke. And it will be a piece of good news for them if all the restaurants go smoking free. But I am of the opinion that there should be smoking sections in some restaurants. It is hard for heavy smokers to quit smoking in a short time. If all the restaurants forbid smoking, they may get really uncomfortable. In general, smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants. Restaurants can set non-smoking areas and smoking areas for different customers. But I think that if smoking is permitted, it should always be in an area that non-smokers do not have to go through because no non-smokers want to expose themselves to second hand smoke.",B1
"Students do part time job for fulfilling their necessary requirments like education, necessary needs ect. If parents are not able the fee of children then the students are doing part time jobs. The trend doing part time jobs is popular in foreign countries because studies are expensive in foreign countries and parents are not able to pay the fee of children. If foreign countries students went to their college at first time and do part time jobs at 2nd time to fulfill their requirements. Students do part time jobs because of poverty and to help out their parents but it effects their health and make them week. They don't eat food at time which causes bad effect to their health. In Pakistan this trend is so popular but due to poverty students do part time job. So, the government of Pakistan and the foreign governments should have to do the fee concession for the poor students to make them well educated and make their society a well educated society. So, if students stops doing part time jobs they become healthy and well educated. Government should have to do concession for making their society healthy and well educated. Students should stopped part time jobs if fee concession are made by government.",B1
"Part time job is being a worker or student for periods that take less time than a full, regular schedule or which an employee does not work full hours. This is an extra source of money or income especially for students. It can be a service crew, assistant, store keeper, helper, tutor, waiter or waitress, vendor, office worker, book keeper, online teacher, etc. Many college students need this because it's hard to be a full time or regular worker while studying your lessons, doing your projects, thesis and assignments in school at the same time. I can relate myself because I 'm a student library assistant in our university and this part time job really helps me and my family in paying tuition fees for my study. Although the money that I will get from the part time job can't cover all my tuition fees and miscellaneous but still it helps a lot.

"Recently, Seoul in South Korea make a law that forbidden smoking in the park. Smokers in the park or big square have to pay a charge for smoking. However, many smokers are upset with that rule of smoke and still, many restaurant do not forbid smoking indoor. Smoke in the restaurant should not be allowed because of several reasons. First, restaurants are usually indoor place and smoke indoor place pollute indoor air. This will be extremely harmful for the people who do not smoke. Smoking in the restaurant threatens non-smoker's health and it is unacceptable. Non-smoker's right to be health should be protected. Second, the smell of smoke make flavor of food worse. Restaurant customers smell smoke rather than delicious food. Also, smoke make restaurant dirty. Chemicals in the smoke make indoor dirty. Both of those facts will be big damage for restaurant. For the better environment of restaurant, smoke in the restaurant should be forbidden. Some people can argue that right of smokers should be protected. However, rights of other people are also important. Of course, for the smokers, facilities such as smoking room are needed for smokers. For the every people's health, include smokers', smoking in the restaurant should be forbidden.",B2

Some people think about complete ban of smoking in all the restaurants. I agree with it because it is a good idea to do it. There are two justifications listed below to support my argument. First, smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Smoking cause a lot of disease such as lung cancer and it harm the non-smoker more than smoker. When eating in a restaurant, the non-smokers have no place to go if smokers smoke around them. What's more smoke does harm the environment in the restaurant, it causes the air pollution and something else in the restaurant. How can you enjoy your meal if you eat in this restaurant?Second smoking may bring fire to people in the restaurant. It may cause fire when someone litter the cigarette around and the worst thing is the fire burn the house and hurt the people in the restaurant.

"It is important for college students to have a part time job. Agree, if they know how to manage their self and time. By having part time job will help them to build their responsibility with what they do, also will give them more confidence and experience. Because in the real world now, having the university degree won't guarantee you will get a good job and good living. So when the college students want to start early to learn about the job world or business world it's a good idea. Because as soon they can start, they can get more experience and opportunity to learn more in their young life and later on when they must face the real business world they will know or at least they know what to do and read the situation. Only the problem is they can handle it or not! Having a job is a more serious topic, when we have job means we must be more responsible.

"Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? I perfectly agree. Today's tuition is so expensive more than you think. The prices are fast increase now. So what should we do? Do we borrow money to parents? It is limitative action. We must earn money ourselves. May be we can't pay school expenses. Cause they're too expensive. But I think we can earn our allowance. A month allowance that one person use is about 30, 0000won. It's a quite a lot of money. And it's also you can get to money from part-time job. Just spend your 5 times than you can get it. Many people say if I have a part time job, I won't have time to myself! yes. It is important to have time to myself. However, you think a little bit differently. If you have a part-time job, you will learn many things. First of all, you know that culture of society. You can learn how to serve the people, and manners. You meet a lot of people. Some are kind, generous, others are rude, no manners. You may be embarrassed to the latter. But it's the chance, you get over the difficulties. So have a part-time job is important.",B1
"I disagree that college students must have part-time jobs. People around me have experiences about part time jobs and they think it is important to get a job or live their lives. However, I think having part time job is not good for students. I do not have much experience about that and my parents think studying hard is better. Thus, I was not interested on, but my brother was not. He got a part time job in family restaurant as soon as he entered university. He devoted his hours to clean dishes or make food. He always worries about his grade, but he can't handle it because that work makes him tired. If he doesn't have to go to school, he must go to that restaurant and work at least 8 hours. I think it is terrible. Because of that, my brother's hands have a knife wound. Of course, earning money is important, but I think reading books or enjoy their own university life is more important. I also try to enjoy my life. I think after graduating university, people have to get a job and work, so we don't have to do part time job to have experience about jobs. I hope many students in Korea enjoy their lives to see movies, read books or enjoy their hobbies instead of working.",B1
"At present, in many restaurants have a smoking room and no-smoking room. But no-smoking person see the smoke scene in smoking room. No-smoking person feel bad because hate smoking.

Nowadays wherever we go, we can find people smoking even it is prohibited to smoke. Many countries are trying to stop people from smoking in restaurant and have some rules. I think it is a good rule. There are several lessons that I support this rule. In some countries, people are no longer allowed to smoke in many public place and restaurant. Restaurants are the places where many people are eating or staying around. The places have to be comfortable and very clean. If people start to smoke, the places might be full of smoke and the non-smokers would feel unpleasant. There would be full of cigarettes smell and left over cigarettes all over the floor. By this, numerous people who are summing to the places would not have pleasant time and good rest.

We should write rules for the person who smoke in the restaurant or all the public place that they should not smoke if you want to smoke you should go back home and smoking. I totally agree that smoking should be banned from restaurant or all public places. It causes harm not only to the individuals who are smoking, but to the people around them too. I think that smoker should stop smoke for yourself and people around you. Furthermore if you stop smoking you will have a good health. You should change yourself to exercise all do other activities such as play sports indoor or outdoor, eating fresh food and vegetable, chewing the gum replace smoking. If you stop smoking it make you save money and save your long life.",B1

Besides studying, it is a good choice for the young people to strengthen their abilities and skills and solidify their positions or their statuses in the future. Also, when doing a part time job, the student can practice the lessons they got from school. The knowledge that the students get from the school is never enough. Students can only understand the meaning of it, but they do not know how to apply it. So, it's really good to let them experience it. But in the end, part time jobs are not only for students, it's for all. It's for people who want to earn extra money. It's for people who just want to have fun. It's for people who want to have an experience. It's for people who want to prepare their selves on to the real world that allows them to be more independent, more experienced and confident.",B1
"Smoking kills. Don't they ever read the government warning even in a pack of a cigar? Smokers just don't listen. Smokers really are examples of a non tremulant and careless people. They don't care about what's happening in their system especially in their lungs. Despite that the government raises the price of tobacco to discourage people from smoking, smokers still continue to be a loyal fan of this habit and often waste their earnings just for cigarettes. Some governments had recently set up a law against smoking in public places, pub's, and some other places like restaurant. Would you rather breathe the smoke that's causing pollution or breathe the fresh air coming in your way? Some people hate to inhale the smoke from a cigar especially when eating a delicious food or sustenance from specialties of other restaurants. Smokers enjoy smoking to relax and have a peace of mind and to a greater degree, when that restaurant has the music that soothes and relates with your mood. Well, aren't they concern about the people around? You wouldn't even enjoy eating. Probably they will move to other spot just to evade the smoke. Besides that, owners will worry about their chairs or tables being burned and damaged by a simple stick of cigar. Indeed, smoking in restaurants must be banned. On the outcome of restricting smokers to use a certain place like a part of the restaurant, smokers will shift to another place causing them to smoke less frequent in restaurants. Having a cleaner, healthier environment especially in a restaurant will have a better cycle of the place and helping to boom the industries.",B1
"I believe that smoking should not be banned in restaurants in Japan for the following three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not illegal in society, so what right does an individual establishment have to rewrite the rules that we all live by and accept? Certainly smoking can be frowned upon, but an outright ban borderlines on illegal. Smoking may make some people uncomfortable, much in the way that loud earphones or voluble cel-phone use on trains is irritating. However, can we ban such behaviour? Smoking is a behaviour, and restaurants do not have the right to police behaviour. Secondly, restaurants are ultimately businesses, and must serve the needs of customers in order to remain solvent. Currently, many people wish to smoke while they eat and drink, and for as long as that is the case, restaurants should provide spaces where this is possible. Certainly smoking sections are necessary in order to provide non-smokers with comfortable environments also; however, an outright ban merely seems draconian and unfair, and unworthy of a civilized democracy. Finally, there is the snowball issue: if we ban smoking due to health concerns, what will be next? Banning meat-eating if vegetarian lobbies gain the upper hand in the burgeoning health-craze? Or banning furniture made of wood if anti-forestry groups gain the upper hand? Banning smoking in restaurants is the beginning of a slippery slope, as self-interested lobbies begin to successfully steer public opinion to serve ultimately selfish, nonsensical and short-sighted goals.",C2
"Smoking is a famous act of the today's generation. They try to tell us that they are the follower of the modernism but actually they are wrong. Smoker use mostly tobacco to entertain themselves. But actually they burn their lives and as well as others. They enjoy smoking to release their depression and think that they are free from them. They are put their life in danger actually. They face lots of diseases, lot of mishappenings happen. Why they do so? Why they act like that? Lack of knowledge? They are misguided by others? What is the reason behind that? I think they have no enough knowledge about that, about their act, and disadvantages. They only start that due to fashion, sometimes want to compete others. Sometimes due to depression. But if they know the disadvantages of smoking they won't do this. But here is a question new generation knows all that think why they act so? Boys thought that girls like them when they smoke? No, never!!! Then why??? The only reason I have come to agreed upon is the materialistic thinking and the no purpose race of looking different and cool which has unconsciously started through different sources.",B1

"smoking is one of bad habit that I hate most. When a smoker burns a cigarette, he begin to hurt himself. And if there is someone staying around him, he is smoking the second-hand smoke. Especially in public occasion, smoking maybe results in an even serious affection. That situation is always seen in most restaurants. Drinking and smoking seem to the most usual things on the restaurants' tables. However, there is not everyone want to smoking, and someone who cannot stand the smoking maybe in the restaurant. Consequently, I tend to Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. After all, the restaurant is public place. It is difficult to know whether everyone here doesn't mind your smoking here. It should be also considered that if smoking is really completely banned, what affection it can make to the smokers. Actually their smoking on table, in most case, is only a habit, not a necessary thing. Usually, seldom do they go on smoking when they are told not to smoke in the restaurant. So it won't result in much trouble for the smokers. Through the analysis between both sides of the smokers and non-smokers, I agree with the point that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"Nowadays, the number of smokers is increasing. More and more people have the habit of smoking. They say that it can help them relax themselves. So the phenomenon is becoming more and more common. As a result, more and more people smoke everywhere, even in restaurants. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Following are some reasons of my opinion. Firstly, the behavior of smoking in restaurant can not give others the good impression when they meet you for the first time. Maybe, smoking is necessary for some business, but as for me, the image is not good. And when we are in restaurant, the restaurant is a public place for many people. It may have bad influence. Secondly, smoking in restaurant will pollute the clean air. Restaurant is a place for dinner, and inevitably a number of people will feel annoyed by the smoke. Last but not least, non-smokers in the restaurant will breathe the harmful air if smoking is allowed. This affects their rights. From my perspective, it is an offensive behavior of smoking in restaurant. Many restaurants in our country haven't taken measures to ban the smoking. So, we should try our best to carry on the plan to ban smoking at all the restaurant in the country.",B1
"I disagree with a opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. To be sure it is said that smoking represents a hundred evils and not a single good. In fact everyone understands a weak point of smoking. For example, people who smoke are missing their appetite. Of course littering of a cigarette is out of the question. To make matters worse, the smoke from people's who smoke cigarette make non smokers feel bad. But even considering their weak points of a cigarette it is too disadvantageous that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants. I think that sales at the restaurant decrease if all the restaurants in Jaqpan completely bans smoking. There are some reasons. First, I think that people who want to smoke after the meal don't want to go to eat to restaurants which smoking are banned. Second, the seat at a restaurant is filled to capacity for the most part when we go to a restaurant to prepare for a test in the evening. I think that it is necessary to make a firm barrier between smoking place and non smoking place in order to come true to set up smoking places at restaurants. This is why smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. First reason, it is good for employers. College students have much advantage to be employed. They have more free time than others. They have strong power and high intelligence. And, they have strong eagerness which they want to get a job. They are great working power, which they have high potential ability. And, part-time job is low cost relatively. Many companies want low price working power such as part-time worker. It is good thing that many college students contribute working power to society. Second reason, it is good for college students economically. Many college students need much money for various reasons. If they work part-time job, they get wages in short time. It is natural that college students begin a part-time job. Third reason, it is good for college students to experience works. College students are located in front of adults. Part-time jobs get for them to experiences of works. If they have experiences of part-time job before they get a normal job, they can get the job smoother than without them. It gets advantage for college students to get the job. They are why I agree that college students have a part-time job.",A2
"In my case, Part time job is important to many university students. Doing part time job help more grow up man. And get a confidence. Near my friends, some guy never do part time job. And he provides all money from his parents. He spends money buying something. I think he waste money to buy cloth. I asked him 'Hey do you think are you waste money?' and he said 'I'm ok my parents is rich person.' That moment I recognized. He doesn't know value of money. If he tried to get money through working, He couldn't say like that. In this situation. Doing part time job help to recognize value of money. Money is very important. Using money is easy, buy saving or getting money is hard and painful. I tried to save money, I make a plan. But I can't do like plan. It was very hard and difficult. When I worked at coffee shop, I made a many kind of coffee. Some rude people called me 'hay' I felt very not good. Getting money is painful that I knew it. But through coffee shop part time job I learned that getting money is hard and painful. So I planned always to use money. That behavior is always help me",A2
"Nowadays, smoking people are a lot, but, people who don't smoke or don't like the smell of smoke are more than smoking people. It is harmful for body to smoke. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoke has no benefit for body. Some people just can't stop but to smoke, they smoke no matter where they are. They don't think about people that around them. Maybe some people feel uncomfortable or don't like the smell. Therefore, I think smoke in the public is a bad manner. In some shopping malls, stores or air ports have some space to serve people smoke. This is a good for people who want to smoke. But, I don't think plus this space in restaurants is a great idea. Because we eat meal in the restaurants, I think nobody want to smell smoke when you are eating something. In my opinion, it is necessary that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Having a comfortable environment is everybody's right, and the people who smoke shouldn't annoy the others when they making dinner. Don't smoke in the restaurant is a basic manner, doesn't is?",B1
"Part time job is the way of earning money. It is common to students who have to be financially independent, and those who want to be financially independent, especially those who are in need of money for them to study. There are many advantages that we can get in doing part time job. We can gain new knowledge, skills, and experiences that we've never done before. Experiences could lead us to a challenging life. You will learn how to synchronize your activities, organize, and manage your time for your job and studies.

Your experiences will create a strong impression for the employer. Although it make up the time for leisure, advantages the students gain are worth it. It's like when you worked so hard for your job, the most immediate reward is the money that you have earned. It feels good whenever you are using the money that you have earned coming from your job. You can help your parents with financial problems if you have something to pay, like the utilities expenses. You and your parents would appreciate the things that you have done while you are still a young teenager working already and helping your family for the expenses. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom.",B1
"I think that smoking is very bad, because tobacco is not only destroying themselves but also harm those around you as well many people smoke because they think that a fashion of their friends and smoking is a good thing. Smoking useless because it destroys the body's systems. Such as the nervous system. Internal systems of the body such as liver, kidneys, lungs, smoking causes many diseases. Including lung cancer. Diseases of the respiratory system. And digestive system. Current smoking rates continued to grow, especially teenagers who are young and are still unable to earn money to buy your own pace. Negative effects of smoking every year sd will have died from smoking each year, 400, 000. People or maybe more than the annual government budget to pay the cost of treatment. Caused by smoking a lot. Danger of smoking today with over the past several times due to current smoking with nicotine and low tar cigarettes make people breathe deep into the lungs. Who live with smokers may be the same, we call this group the second-hand smoke smoke from smokers contained a small can of smoke into the lungs. Second hand smoking effects of smoking were broken. Smoking not only affects the smokers but also to direct others in the atmosphere. Inhalation of toxic smoke from cigarette smoke go by. Harmful as cigarette smokers.

"Today, many students earn special money by the Working Part Time Jobs which do most of the students will work in the service as a waiter or waitress or servers such as in food shop, in the mall, or working with media, Internet cafÃ© and etc. Most of the students due to work Part Time to earn extra classes and to alleviate the burden of families taking time to make the experience useful and work well. Work Part Time is a very important to students in today's society, particularly the loss of property in the study. The students have to make a right decision when they decide to work. It's true parents want to see us got a good result from the study when we are in university, then want to see us got a high salary when we graduate. This is the steps that we all know that our parents expect to see. But for some family, parents think that they just want to see their children grow up and can stand by their own feet. That's all that they need, so they don't expect that their children must get a good grade or high salary. The children will be pressured so parents don't expect too high. So to have part time job may useful for students who lack of money, useful for students who want to have job record, useful for students who want to have experience and many reasons. No one knows but ourselves know. Please make a good consideration before go to work is what I suggest.",B1
"Smoking has become very common, especially to teenagers. This activity usually begins at high school when every student tries to experiment a lot of stuff. There are variety of ways on how teens get into this habit. One way is that they smoke just to feel that they fit in. They think that it is cool to smoke because adults do it or because it so badass. Another is the cause of peer pressure. During your teenage years, peers have this very powerful influence to you thus when one of your peers lights a cigar you tend to be curious and try it as well. And then before you know it, it becomes a part of your life, a bad habit that you cannot stop despite the negative effects that you yourself know it gives. It is very ironic that despite the fact that everyone, who is addicted to smoking, is aware of what is going to happen to them later on doesn't give up this habit. People should start to realize the danger of this habit. Tobacco smoking is one of the leading causes of the death of people. It is not just dangerous to the smoker but also the people around who inhales the same smoke smokers puff out of their cigars.",B1
"I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree with that. First, people who smoke everyday often get bad health. For example, to feel tired every time, and to become cancer. If you were so, you can't live with happiness. It is very serious problems. To live healthy is the most important thing. Second, people around smoking people feel bad, and is also get bad effects. The smells are bad for non-smoking people. They can't eat dinner with peppiness. And the second-hand smoke is more dangerous for other than smoking people. It is more serious problem than the first or second problems. Finally, some smoking people's manner is bad. For example, after smoking, some people throw the trash out. It is also serious problem for other people. Some people might say that developing country people get money from making cigarette. It is true. If we ban smoking, their jobs are not needed. However, the job making someone to be bad health is the worst job. Smoking is dangerous, and is completely bad. It is better that buy others than cigarette. It is good for you, and other people. It is why I agree with the statement.",A2
"Now in our community in the Philippines it's pretty tough to even get money much less work for it. Here even students are now working just to fulfil their families or own needs. Working part time means that now students are being more mature and are coming of age. In most of our lives, us students just rely on our pocket money which our parents seemingly gives us but sometimes even that is not even enough to sustain us from buying what we want and not what we need. In some schools they forbid students working part time because it would violate the school policy unfortunately it does not stop the students from going to different kind of jobs for extra cash. But working part times doesn't mean that the student needs money to sustain themselves but also their families, there are some cases that when some of the said student's parents cannot afford the tuition of the school the students would likely take matters into their own hands by stopping their education and working part time of occasionally full time jobs. Sadly because of our economy is still not improving for everyone's sake, the students have to work even if they like it or not.",B1
"Before, I will conclude this topic. I would like to talk about some of my bad experience about smoke. The first time I went to America. I have found that 60-70 percents of American are smoke. I think they like to smoke as same as eating food everyday and some of my friend told me that smoking make them relax and calm down. I work in a steak house. I have a lot of friends. One day when we closed the restaurant. We has to mop the floor, clean table, clean grill, stock the products and etc. I know that it was a hard work to close the store and that day the crowd of the customers went to ate in our restaurant. It plus more hard because normally we started closed 10PM but that day, we started to closed at 12. 00 PM. Everyone knew that it was prohibited to smoke in the store but everyone 5-6 employees and 1 manager was smoked but me and my friend hate smoke. This restaurant was like a cigarette factory. It's make me headache. It's ridiculous for me that manager did not obey the rules. You see that we cannot stop people to smoke in restaurant. But it's good to prohibited because not everyone like smoke smell such as me. About to prohibited smoke are more good things than bad things. I know that restaurant have to response to the demand of the customers then restaurant will earn more money but restaurant must care the health of the customer too.

"It is very good for the college students since they need more money to use for their education. Now a day, I see the majority of the college students work part-time job after their classes. Some students work full time job on their holiday so; I think part-time job is important for college students very much. Why part-time job is important and benefit to college students? There are three reasons; make money, use their free time, and support their finance. First of all, part-time job is important for college students because they can make more money to use for their education, to use for their everyday life, and so on. Many college students use more money for their education such as pay their stationary, pay for their study register that everything need more money. Another reason, part-time job is benefit to college students so much since they can use their free time to work and to earn money in the same time. Some students in the college use their free-time to play games, to searching the internet, and to something useless. If they have part-time job their free time will be useful. Last reason, part-time job will support their finance because some of them come from working class family that get financial problems if they work part-time job they will be better. In conclusion, part-time job is very important for the college students since they can make money, use their free time, and support their finance.",B1
"Smoking is one of those human activities that, in a way different from alcohol, has the potential to do considerable harm to others. It is also a big nuisance to people who do not smoke. Compared to drinking alcohol, another activity whose regulation has demanded countless hours of legislators' time, smoking is a ""harmless"" activity, at least in the sense that smoking a cigarette or three does not lead to an increased risk having a traffic accident. Yet the well-documented negative effects of second-hand smoke can pose serious health risks over a prolonged period of time to even completely healthy people, not to mention people who have respiratory conditions such as asthma. While there are few situations where a non-smoker must be nearby someone is smoking, the restaurant is probably the most common. In a closed space with poor ventilation, which describes most restaurants, second-hand smoke has a way of spreading throughout the entire place. This is often true even when a restaurant has designated-smoking areas. The big problem here is the fact that, while there are places to have a smoke outside of restaurants, there are few places other than restaurants where one can sit down, relax and have a bite to eat, other than of course one's home. For people whom cigarette smoke dulls the flavor of their food or aggravates their allergies, eating at a restaurant where smoking is allowed becomes something unenjoyable, and may cause them to not ever come back. This is why many restaurant owners do not need to fear any lost business: while they may lose customers who are smokers, they will gain new customers who prefer a smoke-free environment. Restaurants owners will also not have to replace their yellowed wallpaper every year, worry about supplying and emptying out ashtrays, and make more efficient use of the space in their restaurant thanks to being able to allocate all of it to non-smoking.",C2
"In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not only has deleterious effects on the non smokers present there but also may cause allergic coughing to many people. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking and try to imitate it which may later develop into a habit. Especially in the restaurant, there is a lot of food, it will imminently in people's mouth; therefore, smoking in the restaurant is the worst influence to people's health! From most people's perspective, the drawbacks of totally banning cigarette smoking in restaurants outweigh its benefits. Smoking is a health issue and it should be prohibited. The problem is, in spite of its terrible effects on health, quite a lot of people take up this dangerous habit. The number of smokers is increasingly large, so they can affect public opinion and the economy. If we totally ban smoking right now, not considering the smokers, things may get out of hand. The only thing we can do now is to ban smoking step by step, beginning with a partial ban and then a total ban. Publicity and education are also indispensable to show smokers and non-smokers the lethal nature of cigarette smoking.",B1
"ï¼© agree. Because I think a pert-time job helps us independent. And a pert-time job teaches me any things. About First reason, today almost Japanese student give money for college by parents.

So, I think part-time job chance they think. About second reason, I feel so very much. Pert time job link various people, example young and old. They have owed thinking. We study several ideas. If college students to not have a part-time job, they do study? I do not think so. Almost students will be idle. I think they need to have purpose.

"Some people said that it is not suitable for secondary school students to have a part time job, but how about university student? I answer is absolutely yes, because part time job can help the students' self-development. A part time job can help students to gain work experiences, which are exceedingly important for university students. Nowadays, employers always ask their employees if they have any work experiences, if they do have, then the chances of getting a better job would increase. A part time job is not just help the students to broaden their working horizons, but also give them chances to learn how to manage their money. University students get salaries from their part time job, so they can decide how to spend their money, consume it or save it into banks? This can be a challenging questions for them, how to use money in a proper way? This is a good chance for university students to work their own strategies out. Some people may say that a part time job can really disturb students' academic performance, but I dare say it is all about time management skills, if a person has a better time management skills, he can absolutely handle a part time job without developing a disastrous academic results. Part time job can benefit students a lot, we should support university students to have part time job.",B1
"Recently, banning smoking at all restaurants becomes a hot topic of discussion. Government also implants the law to ban smoking in public area. The supporter points out that banning smoking in restaurants can improve air quality of restaurants as well as health of workers and customers of restaurants. Other people such as restaurant owners argue that this can cause loss in term of profit. As a whole, the benefit of banning smoking in all restaurants outweighs its drawback. Firstly, banning smoking can improve the air quality of restaurants as this reduces the release of second hand smoke from smokers which contains harmful substances such as tar and nicotine which is harmful for non-smokers and workers of restaurants. Customers still inhale second hand smoke when sitting at non-smoking area due to the air-conditioner system of restaurant. Passive smoking can even greater harm to health of non-smokers than active smoking. That explains why smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Some people argue that some smokers may not go to restaurants after banning smoking and result in the loss of profit. They also add that some restaurants such as discos and bars as most customers at such places are smokers. However banning smoking of restaurants can improve the image of restaurants and increasing no. of non-smoking customers compensate the reduction in no. of smoking customers. Passive smoking in bars and discos still cause harm to their workers.",B1
"I believe that college students can be benefited by a good part-time job. At first, going to college is expensive, not every student can afford it. Not just the regular fee; books, transportation, entertaining cost or extra expenses like hanging out with friends, new clothes and shoes, etc. To many students, going to college also means leaving their family or home town. Suddenly, young students need to adjust to live outside with strange people. Learning how to take care of themselves is also important for students in their college lives. By having a part-time job, students can learn how to use their money more wisely. Nevertheless, college students are adults; they should not keep asking money from their parents. Work experience or internship is another reason I support college students to have a part-time job. Schools, in a way, are not as competitive as outside society. Part-time job is a good way for students to know what kind of quality, personality, and social skill they need when it comes to work. In the near future, they need to earn their living on their own. Work experience is important for them to find a job after they graduated. To sum up, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"I'm agreeing for this topic. Too hard to find a part-time job, many people find a part-time job. These days a lot of high school students do part-time job, so university students is not easy to find. Therefore, a long time to find part-time job and we can find we want work for aptitude. Anyway part-time job is so important to us. Especially when compared to interns. If you want employee you are very hard working every day. That means interns changing employee probability is very low. But what about part-time job? Anyone ever will know if part-time job. You can't never ever see the future. But if you find your compare one-hundred percent satisfaction part-time job to you. That is chance maybe fifty-fifty chance. Anyway if you can find part-time job, you will think one more time. Most of parents if they children want to the part-time job, Maybe almost parents to tell disagreed nuance Anyway But I think we're university students that means almost completely grow adult, so part-time job give it to us some help. First, Part-time job is a part of social experience and monthly save money, if you want independence you must have experience in save money Second, if you save a lot of money your parents don't care almost everything that is important thing. Third, you will meet new people, i can make book on meet because that is very amazing you know just simply part-time job Had relationship of boggles the mind.",B1

"Nowadays many college students choose to take a part-time job for the purpose of obtaining more social skills. I really agree with them. Firstly and most importantly, the student will join the social competition sooner or later., but what they learned in school is just the professional knowledge, which is just made up small part of their social lives. It's the abundance of social activities that make interviewers deny their ability,. But if they have the experience of working outside, situation will totally change. They will know how to communicate with leaders, as well as with workmates and with customers. The perfect connection with people around will help a lot, no matter on the process of searching aid or struggling for more payment. And most college students will search a part-time job that is connected tightly with their specialized subjects. And no one would miss the chance to apply their knowledge into the processions. And the application means a good review. So instead of having a bad influence on their study, they can improve learning their level easily. There is one important reason for supporting the part-time job that can't be neglected. The lacking of time makes them become a well-organized man. Their schedule is full. So the person will never have a opportunity to drown themselves in computer games. For the three reason above, I strongly support the fact that university students take a part-time job. It's a chance rather than a waste of time. So I encourage all the college students to have a try on the part-time.",B1
Smoking is a process which is used by people. In this process the material which are harmful for the health of man are used such as nicotine and other things which are used in powder form and in liquid form are really harmful for mankind. The things used are harmful for the lungs and liver. Once it is used it is difficult to get rid of from this. And restaurant is a place where people go to refresh themselves by eating food and take pleasure by going there. In reataurant different type of people come and refresh themselves. But if there is smoking in restaurant it is not only effect health. But it also effect food items there. Smoking have bad effect on health. Smoke produce by smoking effect the lungs of person who is smoking and it is also dangerous for other people. Bad smell present in the mouth of people who take smoking and even due to smell it is difficult to talk with them. And in restaurant where many people came it give bad effect on their health. People dislike smoke person. So smoking should be banned not only restaurant but also from other public places. It not only effect health but also pollute the air which is dangerous for environment.,B1
" I don't quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think. Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who don't smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money. As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we can't force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who don't smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. That's my opinion.",A2
"There are many arguments for and against smoking. However, I agree this idea which smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, I dislike the smell of the smoke and if I snuff up it, I maybe lose my appetite. Secondly, smoking cause various disease such as lung cancer, stroke, asthma. Smoker often cause these disease but if I snuff up smoking, I also cause such disease Moreover, passive smoker are more harmful than smoker. Because, passive smoking contain more harmful materials than smoking. So, it is very unfair. Why I am damaged by smoker? I am very angry when people walk with smoke. Finally, Smoking sometimes wound others badly. For instantly, my junior high school friend has been troubled with asthma for long years. One day I and he go to the shopping. When we meet smokers in the restaurant, my friend suffer from smoke and finally his breathing is very slow and weakened. So, I take him into the hospital. So, I perfectly agree that smoking should be banned at the restaurants in Japan.",B1
"I would certainly disagree with the opinion that It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As a student, we should still concentrate on our study. Doing a part time job will surely influence our study, which is against the purpose of us attending the college. It takes us much time working thus reduces our time for studying. Besides, part-time job can cause other troubles to you. When you make any small mistakes like dropping a plate accidently, you get scolded; when you meet with some tough customers who never seem to appreciate you service, you get frustrated. What's more, as students, we are not so sophisticated as the adults in society and thus we are likely to be cheated without awareness. There are many cases when college students go to find some lurable jobs and are eventually cheated of money or, worse still, violated by others. Last but not least, college is where our view towards life is forming. We can not make sure that we will not be influenced by all kinds of people we meet. Some would regret for the rest of their life if they form negetive attitude of life or a synical mind. All in all, it it really not a good choice for students to try a part-time job. Study, instead, is more recommended.",B1
"Nowadays, the world has changed. The college students not only the college students in West but also in East are going to have a part-time jobs when they have free time. I think It is important for college students to have a part-time job because they have to live themselves after they moved from their parents' house so they must earn money themselves. There are many reasons for college students to have a part-time job. For example, they can purchase things they like, they may help their parents to decrease their expenses, they will realize on the wealth of money, they can spend time doing the right thing instead of playing computer games, surfing the net, or playing facebook. Doing the part-time job isn't a waste of time because they will get many new experiences for their daily life, they may make friends from their part-time job and may be they will meet their boyfriend or girlfriend, and they will make their parents proud to themselves that they can help themselves and may be these college students will grow into a good and responsible adult. As we've known that doing the part-time job has many benefits so it is better to persuade the teenagers who are studying in college or university to do this.",B1
"I agree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we know, smoking is not good for our health. First of all, cigarette contains nicotine that can damage our lungs and make us hardly to breathe. The government also gives warning to the smoker to make less the smokers. We can see the warning in every pack of cigarette, and it is said that smoking can cause cancer, hypertension, and also disturb fetus. Smoking not only inflict to us, but also to other people. Smoke makes the no fresh air and sometimes people that not usual with it can cough when she or he suck in it. If smoking is not banned, it can annoy other people that do not smoke that usually called passive smoker. The smoke of cigarettes is more dangerous for passive smoker than active smoker, because the smokes that are aspirated by the active smoker are not good for our health. We must keep our health because we are the next generation on our nation. Besides, we must keep our environment better and make the air still fresh and free from smoke. Those are some reason why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I don't agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because this statement is too severe to follow. In fact, it is clear that smoking is one of the most causes to lead to cancer. And smoking gives bad influence to not only their own but also around people. I think this is the worst point of smoking. And I need not ban smoking completely. I think that the restaurants should divide into smoking people and not smoking people. GREEN MOS BURGER is a good example. In there, smoking seats are placed outside the shop and non-smoking seats are placed inside the shop. This is very interesting. Few years ago, in there, smoking seats were placed inside the shop. This is cared about this problem. Now at the many restaurants, smoking seats and non-smoking seats are divided inside the shop. I am satisfied with this situation. But the restaurants that are banned smoking are increasing. So if I think about the matter in terms of management, it is good to build the restaurants for smoking people. These are the reasons why I don't agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"I agree with this statement that students in college should have a part-time job. However, I think that a college student should only have a part-time job if they can find one that relates to their major. It is kind of a waste of time to do anything that wouldn't really help you in graduating from college, and the fact of the matter is that if you can find a part-time job that is related to your major, you'll gain valuable experience and probably also make more money than you would at a job that is completely unrelated to your major. A part-time job gives you the opportunity to develop crucial skills like responsibility and money management while you're still young so that you will not have to worry about these after you graduate. You already have developed the skills to a point where they are nearly second nature, so you'll be miles ahead of the other students who are just beginning to discover these problems after they graduate. Lastly, a part-time job is a good thing to list on your resume because it shows that you were good enough at school to have enough time to engage in another pursuit.",C2
"Recently, some local governments ban on smoking on street. Smokers are against this new regulation. But many no-smokers think that smokers should be prohibited smoking in any other public places. Especially, they should be forbidden to smoking in restaurant by regulations. I agree with this idea and I have three opinions about this topic. First, it is widely known, the cigarette smoke has many various harmful materials for example nicotine, carbon monoxide, tar and so on. It damages not only smokers but also people around them. This smoke gives more harm to children than adults. If you smoke around children, you look like to injure them lungs slowly by knife. Secondly, restaurant is place where many people enjoy dishes. But smoke has too bad smell. People in restaurant that filled by smoke can not relax and taste dishes correctly. All restaurant chefs don't want to enter smokers in them restaurant. Finally, according to some newspaper research, more than a one fourth smoker wants to give up smoking but can not. They also say that they will be able to give up if the rules of smoking changes stricter. Strict rules are chance for smokers to change them life style healthier.",B1
"Part time job is very good job because get money and pay your free time for good thing. I usually do part time job in summer. Part time job is good experience for life. I can make money from part time job. You should make part time job for help your father and mother. I think part time job make one day is important more than in part. You will enjoy with your friends. Part time job make many friend and make happiness for life. I like part time job because it make a lot of money and more experience. I can use money from part time job pay for class myself. Part time job is a good activity for student from university or high school. You have many advantages. In this summer, I still want to work. I will find a part time job in a shopping mall. They pay very good and I meet many people. I have fun a lot. Some friend from part time job is very good. We still contact and help to find job. When someone have a good place to work, we will tell each other about a job. Money, experience, friend are a good thing from part time job. I support student to work. It's good to learn by working.",B1
"I agree with the statement. I have two reasons. First, I think they can learn a part of society. Of course, they can't learn it completely. But, it is important to know society. When they graduate university, without knowing it, they will confuse. They may make mistakes from it. Second, they can get some skills. For example, skill of communication, expert or general knowledge. Perhaps, the knowledge which they get to have a part time job are influenced their future. Especially, I think skill of communication is very important. Of course, there is difference of skill of it. But, in our life, we can't live without communication. It is base of life. And, it is sure that the person who has high ability of it is liked. I tell you two reasons I agree with this statement until now. But, I want to except a case. We are university students. We passed the hard entrance examination to study something. If they can not study because of part time job, I don't agree this statement. Part time job is said arbeit by Japanese. I think this word arbeit come from German. The word is arbeiten. This word means work in English. But, when students use this word, it means study in English. So, the work of students are studying. We enter this university to study. From this reason, I think studying is first priority and part time job is second. Therefore, in this case, I disagree with it.",B1
"Should smoking be banned in all public places? I think it is a very serious problem during the smokers. Some support the policy, some against the policy. It is hard to decide which is right or wrong. In my mind, I support the point to ban the smoking in all public place, like restaurants, bus station, and so on. Not for others, but also for the smokers. Various modern researches show that smoking is very harmful to smoker. Smoking causes various diseases for example, when smoking much oxygen is used and less oxygen come to the brain, lungs and heart. This is very dangerous to young people. People should have a good health to do everything. Without a health body, person cannot do something that you like to do. Smoking also has great influence on family. As you know, smoking cost a lot of money. So smoking is not a lightly economic burden. And more terrible things are that smoking will damage DNA, which will change family from physiology and smoking cannot be stopped easily like drugs. According above statements, smoking should be banned because smoking is harmful to health, bad influence on family. Banned smoke can bring us comfortable living environment. Only a comfortable environment, people can live a happy live. So I support the idea to ban the smoking on public.",B1
"I strongly agree that smoking should completely be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the restaurant is the place that family including the children have a meal. Smoking harms the health of non-smoker through cigarette smoke. It is especially harmful to children. It negatively influences the health of children and developing of children's body. Second, cigarette gives unpleasant and uncomfort to non-smokers. Because it is difficult to completely separate the areas of smoking and non-smoking, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Though separating the areas, cigarette smoke comes from non-smoking area. Therefore the right of smokers could not be respected so much, the right of non-smokers is more important than the right of smoker at all the restaurant. Some people think that the right of smokers should be respected. But respecting the right of smokers gives the non-smokers including the children negative effects. So, the right of smokers should be limited at all the restaurants. These reasons are why I strongly agree that smoking should completely be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"Now a day trends have changed study methods and the life style of the students have also changed. In older times parents can easily support their children while they were studying. They could afford their all study expenses as will as their other expenditures. But now a day it's very difficult for some of the parents to do so. So now students have started to do some part time jobs beside their studies. This can help them financially as well as it can help them to gain experience of practical life. If they get job related to their major of studies it provokes their skills in that field and help them financially as well. But beside this it can affect their studies very much, because they can not give proper time to their studies & like this they can't score good grades. Some of the students work hard enough that they maintain their grades and job very well. But some students concentrate on their job and lose their study. But beside all this it is some how necessary for the students to do some part time job. It will help them a lot polish them selves and support their pockets as well. In foreign countries like America and Europe students prefer to do some part time job, like this they are supporting their selves as well as they are contributing in the prosperity of their countries also. In Pakistan we students should try to have some part time job and government should help them by providing jobs in civil and government sector so the students can help them selves.",B1
"Smoking is absolutely one of the devious behaviors, especially the problems it caused within teenagers. We can hear the news about smoking-caused problems among world's teenagers through public media. There are 2 reasons for its rampancy, one of which is its spectacular profit. The other one is that people who once expose to smoking, they would be addicted to it easily. Only when the deep-seated causes are removed can the smoking problems be solved. Authorities should reinforce the security at the Customs so as to cut off the resource of tobacco and cigarette which are usually smuggled. Furthermore, the authorities ought not to only put smugglers into jail but ask them for the clue for the purpose of tracking down the actual instigator. When the toughest problems are solved, it's a lot easier to stop the vice in schools and society. There are several action should be taken. First, governments should enforce harsher law against those deliberate law breakers. Then, schools needs to carry out brainwash correctly, and channel students where is the right way to go. The last, rehabilitation centers are essential to be set up since we can help those devious teenagers recovering from the pathological addiction. Thereafter, the rate of smoking problem among youth population will decrease efficiently.",B2
"Smoking in restaurants is not possible. Restaurants are public places and places to eat myself to not harm the people you might want to come back with. While damage too many people eat rice and give discomfort to others in order to avoid damaging behavior should not smoke. Nonsmokers than smokers who smoke look more damage. All the buildings are now non-smoking restaurant in the building's smoking building, smoking will be positive. Actually, all the damage at the expense of more than one person to enjoy a delicious meal and a chat while eating should refrain from smoking. Create smoking areas for smokers for smokers, where are creating. Where all can dine in the Proficient smoking. Paying money to the rice while eating a hot dog eating discomfort in more comfortable and happy to eat the rice should be a smoking restaurant. Non smoker of many smokers of fewer smokers in order to yield a large number of meals can be happy and everyone should make a space. Number of all the happy meals at the expense of the environment better than if you are going to be. All meals come when you eat happily. Let us concede a little. Thank you",A2
"I disagree the view that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My evidences are below. That smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants does not fit with the reality world. Because a lot of men smoke now, which smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants is impossible at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men maybe against that smoking is completely banned in the restaurants. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. And those smokers will not go to restaurants will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problem. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harm for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for health of people's, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking help them many ways. Some say that they fell happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoking, for all the restaurants want to get more interests. I think maybe we can do other something to solve smoking problem in the restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now.",A2
"I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in country. Because the restaurant is a public place that many people goes there. If there is someone or anyone smoking at the restaurant or anywhere else the smoke will harm the people who don't smoke too so that is an interruption to others. Because is not only does smoking hurt the person who is smoking, but recent scientific and medical shows that the dangers associated with second hand smoking For the smoke from cigarette it's too bad for child, pregnant women and everyone. If you sniff to the smoke for many times you might be at risk to get a lung cancer or many diseases. In some country might be ignored for this problem and think that it is a commonly to smoke! I think there should be a strong punishment for anyone who smoking in the restaurant or any public places such as smoking in hospitals, hotel, school and airports. There should be a strongly legal to manage the smokers to realize that ""where"" or ""when"" that they can smoke, not everywhere every time like these day. In general, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision as to whether to smoke or not should be for each individual to make.",B1
"Without doubt, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Before college, we live at home and enjoyed parents' love and care. So when we first time have the chance to live alone outside, we must have to study how to take care ourselves and be a real person. I had a lot of part-time job experience, I used to worked at a restaurant, is really hard and tired. Every day as I finished my school class, I take bus to my work place. The restaurant is far from my school, so I usually review the school subject during the time. There were always lots of people come to my store and eat dinner, I needed to stand for a long time and walked over and over again around the restaurant, it is almost made me crazy. But the boss and the other people worked in the restaurant we really friendly and they treated me as if we were family. The customs also nice to me. Sometimes they even gave me some little gift. I was very appreciated about this job and the people who I met. I really learn lot from this job, but it is important that should not spent too much time at job, after all, we are still a student, we have to do what we should do. If we can make good use of our time, have a part-time job is a very good experience.",A2
"Smoking has been found to greatly increase the chance of getting lung cancer and various other dangerous diseases. But this is the smokers' problems themselves. Second-hand smoke, on the other hand, can be dangerous to other people around them. Second-hand smoke is often more dangerous than smoking itself, and it can harm other innocent people. There are countless articles on the dangers of second-hand smoke, where innocent people around the smoker like their significant others or child often become sick when around the smoker for long periods of time. The smoke emitted is also extremely bad smelling, and if smoking in restaurants are not banned, it may decrease the enjoyment of other customers with their experience in the restaurant. However, I recognize some people need to smoke, either as a tool to relax, or they are just so addicted to the disgusting nicotine in the cigarettes that they cannot stop. Thus, instead of completely banning smoking in restaurants, there should be specified non-smoking and smoking areas in the restaurant itself. This should be in an extremely secluded area where smoking will not impede on the enjoyment of other non-smoking restaurant goers. All in all, restaurants should not completely ban smoking, but have areas for both smokers and non smokers. ",B1
"I agree with this idea. Before you start to work, you can get some roles as a member of society by having a part-time job. For example, if you work at a restaurant as a hall staff, you have to communicate with others who are various from baby to elderly people. By repeating it, you would be good at talk to other people. It is a great benefit and would be one of your advantages. You would be able to get along with your bosses in your office. When you think part-time job in that way, the experience of it will be your forever treasure. At the same time, you do not have to depend on your parents in terms of money by making money in yourself. However to make money in yourself does not lead to get independent of your parents. You should rely on them in some respects. For example when a trouble you can not deal with happens, you will ask them for help. College students depend on parents in many respects, but you should manage to deal with many problems little by little. Once you are twenty years old, you have to depend on yourself. So you should get ready for your independence from now. The first step is part-time job as I state it that way.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in Taiwan, because the smoking is not good for smokers, but also for people around them. Recently, the number of people who killed by smoking is increasing, half of them don't have the habit to smoke. But why they died in such as cancer and other sick caused by the smoking? The answer is that they breathing in too many second smoke that more unhealthy for the people. Therefore, even if they don't smoke eventually they killed by other smokers. I think this is so fanny for that why no smoking people should be treated by the pain what the smokers should take for. To decrease the risk that those no smoking people take to, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And not just banned at all the restaurants, but also banned at all public place. This is not just taking a care of the no smoking people but the smokers. By this way, the smokers will decrease the times of smoking because there is no place for them to smoke. After long times, they will too forget they are heavy smoker before. The world also can return to the no smoking parodies.",B1
"Part-time jobs are needed by many people especially since we are facing poverty here in the Philippines. There are so many part-time jobs that are offered here like being a tutor, a cashier, a waiter, a dancer, a singer, a dj. It opens up opportunities for people who don't have jobs. It is also a source of extra income for those who are not satisfied with the money they are earning. For example, a business man that has a talent for dancing can enter a part-time job as a choreographer. A part-time job is also really helpful to students who are helping their parents sustain their family. It also helps students in preparing for their future jobs improving their skills in the field of communication and. Even though part-time jobs aren't as big as full- time jobs are, they are still noble jobs. Without these kinds of jobs, our economy wouldn't progress. For example, cashiers are very important in managing the sales of a mall. If people like them don't exist no one can manage the sales because not all of us has the skill. Let us give importance to every job there is for it is our hope in improving our country.",B1
"I agree if smoking at all restaurant and other public facilities banned. Because smoking is not good for our health. Besides that, this activity also can disturb other people. For example if you in the restaurant and there is someone or some people smoking beside of you, I think you will be disturbing. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic that very dangerous for our health. Like toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde and many others toxic. There are many disease caused from smoking activity, there are lung cancer, cardiovascular, bronchitis, and asthma. Bans on smoking in restaurants can substantially improve the air quality. If smoking will not banned, I think the air quality in the word will so bad. Laws implementing bans on indoor smoking have been introduced by many countries in various forms over the years, with some legislators citing scientific evidence that show tobacco smoking is harmful to the smoker themselves and to those inhaling. Our government is also bans smoking in our country. Such as make wanted in the package of cigarette. That wanted contains if smoking can causing some disease such as lung cancer, cardiovascular, bronchitis, and asthma. But that wanted is not useful, because some of Indonesian people don't know about the dangerous of smoking. Additional rationales for smoking restrictions included reduced risk of fire in areas with explosive and flammable hazard, cleanliness in places where food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other flammable things.",B1
"The college students have to study hard in the school. Have student to part time work? I think agree. Because I think to work can learned many thing, we can know how to learning to get along other people. We also learned more skill in the community. It is a way to learning other thing and we can know how to live in the world. We also can know my parents how to hard work for we. If you have a part time work. You can learn how to have duty heart and learn many things. We can to lighten our parents a burden. Parents should felt happy we can know to do for them. I think to do part time have two types. One part time is a fixed work. The other part time is a unfixed work. The unfixed work is like go everywhere to work. Maybe next time have not worked. If you think have work every day. You should find fixed part time work. Because if you only a student. You should unhandy to find all jobs. Because you have go to study in the school. So I think find part time is well for our.

"But because there are many hidden benefits to having a part-time job, I think that many students stand to benefit by having one. For example, I work at the rec center, and as a result I spend a lot of time thinking about health and fitness and how to become stronger, faster, and more fit. Most of my coworkers are the same way, and most of us have a very high level of fitness. This is the hidden benefit that I was talking about. Not only do we have a good job at a fun place on campus, we can learn about how to be healthy and we can have a place where we can do all the things we need to do to stay fit. In the same way, there are different in benefits to different part-time jobs. For example, if you work at a pizza restaurant, you can learn how to make pizza and you can also eat as much as you want to, although that might be bad for you. Every part time job has a hidden benefit that you can take advantage of if you only take the small effort to think about all the things you are doing and how you can work on those things to benefit yourself as well.",C2
"I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants, or s hould I say that smokers cannot stop smoking at restaurants. They may stop c oming to restaurants because they cannon smoke! If a restaurant rejects peop le who love smoking, this lost must be large for the owners of the restauran t, although customers who hate smoking may come there more frequently. Now, there are some systems to divide between smokers and nonsmokers. For example, some designate time to protect nonsmokers from smoke. We cannot smoke amon g the time. Others designate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Such systems are enough to eat good food and make us comfortable. In fact, in a restaura nt where smokers and nonsmokers are completely mixed, I cannot stop coughing. However, when I have a lunch at a family restaurant, I do never conversely worried smoke thanks to division. Furthermore, now the technology to absor b smoke is developing. This may enable nonsmokers to eat lunch next to smoke rs comfortably in the future. Taking profit of restaurants into consideratio n, these steps are realistic and reasonable. If every people can have a good time, we don't necessarily exclude smokers. We only need to invent good wa y to divide smokers and nonsmokers.",B1
"In our country, smoking was enjoyed only by man long time ago. As the status of woman now is promoted in present-day society, they can smoke like men and even regard smoking as the symbol of fashion. What's more, smoking is becoming popular among many young persons. At any places, the smoking persons can be seen any places. However, as to me, it's an ugly behavior especially in public places, such as restaurants. I advocate that smoking should completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking has a serious bad effect on our health. Cigarettes contain various poisonous elements which can be deadly in some degree. If somebody is addicted to it, his body will be exhausted gradually. In public, most of people want to live in harmonious environment and don't hope to be surrounded by smog which is spread by smokers. The smog can be breathed in by others who stay beside the smokers and have no habit to smoke. At this time, it does more harm than the smokers. Furthermore, many people will have a headache or have no appetite on food when smog fills the air at restaurants. When the rest of a cigarette is thrown down with going out, it may cause a fire. To create harmonious environment at restaurant, to appreciate the delicious food, to care about the health of your friends and families, please stop smoking.",B1
First of all effect of smoking on human being will be explained. as everyone knows that smoking is harmful for any person. It causes various diseases in which lungs cancer and asthma are included. Secondly people who are drug addicted cannot leave it easily. Our society have very strange attitude towards smoking young boys thought that they look charming while smoking although smoking is harmful for them and they knew its well but looking hand some is more important for them then their health. its not due to illiteracy but due to goofiness more over cigar is a status symbol in our society and sign for elite class. There is no a single benefit of smoking anyone who take one step to it will take 2 steps towards it and gradually lead toward faun alcohol act. Smoking is also haram in Islam because many other bad things start from it and it's the rule of Islam that nips the evil in the bud. so Islam do not give permission for it further more the things which cause harm for humans beings Islam do not permit those things and smoking is one of them. a person who is habitude of smoking mostly have very unbearable smell in his mouth while he talks other people feel bad and avoid to take him again. So gradually he lost his good friends and become alone. this thing made him feel up from life and he lost interest in his dressing food and family and sometime comments suicide smoking always harmful for human beings in any foam it dial not give any benefit to anyone except the owner of tobacco companies so the benefit of a nation more important than a single person so the Govt. of employer should completely banned tobacco companies if any Govt. do so then I think it was blessing of Allah on that country.,B1
"I agree with the statement above because by doing part time job we can learn to be independent, we can find out how the working world someday we will doing.

"I agree with this statement. In these days, many restaurants in Japan are likely to separate the smoking room from non-smoking room. However some of them fail to separate them completely. This means that even if I take the table in non-smoking area, you may smell the cigarette from the smoking room. Smoking from cigarette makes me uncomfortable, especially when I have a meal. In my opinion, the solution of this problem is that smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants. Moreover smoking is bad for health, and some studies showed that if they smoke while they are eating, the risk of getting cancer is increased. So, Japanese government should make smoking banned at all restaurants in order to save all citizens' health. From my personal experience, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan. One of my friends could quite to smoke by the number of non-smoking area being increasing. It becomes harder for her to find the area where smoking is allowed. This makes her smoking less cigarettes per a day. Then she doesn't want to smoke anymore now. Therefore since I heard this story, I've believed that policy of smoking being banned in all restaurants makes it easier to quit to smoking. That's why I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.",B1
"Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. First of reason, smoke from the smokers can cause the lung cancer to person who lives or stays near them. Nicotine in tobacco causes lung cancer. The lung and respiratory system efficiency will decrease, and that can causes heart disease. Second, the smoke can kill infants. When smoke goes into the body it can destroy inner organic of infants, so the infants would be at an increase risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) if there are infants at smoker's home. The smoke causes respiratory infection, ear problems, and more severe asthma for infants. Both of two cases are called secondhand smokers. The secondhand smoker is another person who breathes the smoke from someone else, and got the effect of diseases. The third, the smoke make bad surrounding. It makes customers in restaurant annoyed, and do not enjoy eating with food. So, they will have a bad mood. All in all, smoking must be banned from our society. Not only it does cause lung cancer to smokers, but also effects to another person near them. If you are a smoker, you should give up smoking before everyone hates you.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons why I support the statement. A restaurant is a place where people have a meal. Most of customers want to enjoy the meal with the smells of foods. But the cigarette smoke may prevent it. And there may be a lot of children and seniors in a restaurant. In this situation, cigarette smoke can be irritated and uncomfortable to non-smokers. And even it is harmful for children and seniors to breathe air with cigarette smoke. Smoking in a enclosed place with a lot of people such as a restaurant causes secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is more harmful than smoking. Cigarette smoke that smokers blow out is more dangerous than that of smokers breathing. And this phenomenon can worsen in an enclosed place such as restaurant. I think it is unfair that non-smokers who don't want to damage their body and pursue pleasure ruin their health because of cigarette smoke. For these reasons, I think smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants and it should be broaden to all public places such as bus stops, parks, concert hall and so on.",B2
"From my view, I totally agree with the statement that university students should take part-time jobs. First of all, Taking part-time jobs can develop students' social skills, like communication and cooperation. With these experiences, students will have a better understanding of how to make their career a success after graduation. Moreover, students can earn money through taking part-time jobs, which help them cover their studying and their current life. In the university, students need money for many purposes such as buying specialized books, school fee, rent I think a part-time job is really an effective tool to resolve these problems. Not only does part-time help students to resolve economic problems but it also help students to be an independent person. When taking a part-time job, you may not ask your parents for money and become more independent. Jobs forms you to be responsible, more self-disciplined. If a part-time job which are suitable for your studying branch, it can give you more practical knowledge of your studying, enhances your knowledge. Last but not least, a part-time job can help student to take up some leisure time. In university, students may have lots of leisure time except studying. By doing a part-time job, students can use up their leisure time and have a substantial university life.",B1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, most students have part-time job in order to pay something, such as eat, transportation and so on. On the other hands, foreign books are very expensive. It costs about NT 1000. So far, I have part-time job. I think I had learned a lot from the part-time job. For instance, I improve my communication skill and get more self-confident. In 2009, every countries had faced economic recession, many people lost job. Maybe family faced that difficult problem. Due to deal with the problem, students have to get a par-time job. The situation is very common in global economic recession. If students have a part-time job, it can decrease parent's hard things. Everyone knows high education is most expensive. Having a part-time job reduces parent's burden and increase experience. Finally, I agree with having a part-time job in college. It is not only to earn money but also to learn a lot. We can make a lot of friends in different field. Getting a part-time job has a lot advantages if you deal with time management. If you are good at time management, having a part-time job is a good choice in college.",A2
"I think smoking should be prohibited in all public places. It is a unhealthy habit, which should be immediately banned. Smoking should only be allowed on personal property and land. There have been numerous reports, linking cigarette smoking to heart disease; lung disease; cancers of the lung, mouth, and other tissues; and other ailments. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemical substances, many of which have been linked to the development of diseases. Chemical substances occur in cigarette smoke as gases or as particals. Many places in which smoking should be banned are in pubs, clubs and working places. Pubs are very important places for people in communities, especially small communities. It is a place for people to socialize and be entertained. In some communities the pub is the town meeting place for the locals. There are no non-smoking pubs and very few non-smoking front bars. Although the eating areas in pubs are non-smoking sometimes there is so much smoke it drifts everywhere. Smoking in pubs is a hazard to non-smokers and the workers. It is unhealthy and not fair on the people that don't smoke and want to have a good time. These days smoking is a popular craze in pubs but should be quickly stopped. Clubs are another place you would avoid if you felt strongly about smoke. Cigarette's contain health-damaging particles and are a health hazard to many.. Smoking is the leading cause of life-threatening diseases and should be done away from public places. More young people go to clubs and it is a bad habit for them to be breathing in smoke. One of the most dangerous things is passive smoking and in clubs this is what non-smokers are doing.",B1
"I agree with the statement. Smoking is not good thing for people. Smoking affects not only people who smoke but also people who are by the smoker. Smoking is harmful for people health. It is said that people who have smoked for a long time are likely to get a cancer. Once they start to smoke, people seems to stop smoking. But smoking costs people a lot of money. And people who smoke waste time. People who often smoke seem to get stress when they don't smoke for a long time. So it seems that smoker have less ""shuchuryoku"" than non-smoker. In addition, it seems that smoker can't run longer time than non-smoker because smoking has our bless equipment bad effect. So most of professional sport player don't smoke. Sometimes famous actors look very cool when he smoke in TV drama. So there are many people who think that smoker is cool. But smoke is not good. In many foreign countries, smoking is banned very strictly. At all side of smoke box, there are large size sentences and pictures about smoke harm in many countries around the world. There are countries in which smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, too. I want to go to the restaurant in which there are many people who are smoking. If the restaurant's food is very delicious, smoking makes the restaurant smelly. So it makes foods bad. And not only people who want to smoke but also non-smoker who dislike smoke smell come to the restaurants. Children, older people and woman who will bear a baby a few month after also want to come to there. But it is harmful for them especially. So for all of people who want to go to the restaurant and enjoy eating and drinking, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I think having a part-time job is important for college students, because in a part-time job we can learn many different experiences Some students just learn about his major, but others skills are very poor, for example, some students just know how to get along with books but don't know how to get along with person. In a part-time job, we can learn how to get along with boss, even can learn how to cooperate to get the work. And we also can absorb some different knowledge from jobs. For example, some job about sells, we have to know that the goods detail before our works, so we can learn some new knowledge. In the job, we can meet many different person, we can learn something special from each person. Last month I had a part-job, and I met one girl she teach me how to baking bread and cake, I think this knowledge is more important than money for me. Now, some students don't need money but get part-time job, because they want to learn something new that is school lack. More and more ways we can found a part-time job, use self's free time to learn something new, I think it's very good, and I think it is very important for college students, too.

"Yes I agree with the above statement. The first and foremost reason is because smoking is totally harmful to one's health and well-being. When someone lights up a cigarette in the restaurant, the smoke that they puff out and either linger in the air or travel around the room is known as second-hand smoking. Second-hand smoking brings even much more disastrous effects and can be detrimental to one's health if they keep breathing the smoke in for a long period of time. Non-smokers who patronized the restaurants just want to have a good time dining and chatting with their companions so they should not have to deal with the smokers who suddenly feel the need to light up. Everyone has been taught to respect one another, the most basic thing when we were younger. So I suggest if the smokers would like to smoke one or two cigarettes, they could respect the other diners and step out of the restaurant for that few minutes and smoke outside or at designated corners of an open-air restaurant if there is one. It would also be a little disgusting if you were to find bits and pieces of cigarette smoke in your soup because a smoker from the table beside yours does not have the basic courtesy to step out for a little while for that puff.

"Smoking in public areas and restaurants should be banned in Japan. I have lived here on and off for a few years and one thing that really irks me is inhaling other people's filthy cigarette smoke against my will. I think that it is about time that smoking in public places and restaurants in Japan was prohibited once and for all. I refuse to sit in a restaurant with smokers and eat a meal because the last thing I want to do is chew my food combined with the flavour of someone's leftover smoke fumes. It is bad enough when I am walking down the street behind someone smoking a cigarette. Unless the wind is blowing the opposite way, the smoke always blows back in my face and I try to hold my breath as I quickly walk past them. I realize that they have the right to smoke but what about my rights not to smoke or breathe it in when I am walking down a public street. My exhaling is not going to hurt them but when they smoke and exhale, it could very well kill me or cause me to get ill if it happens enough times.",C2
"In my opinion part-time job is important for college students. Part-time job is something that helps college students practice themselves before getting job in the future. They receive many experiences from working in part-time job and it makes college students use their time for the useful things. All these, depends on the job that they choose to do, it must be a good part-time job for themselves, not against religion and the job must be please their parents. Moreover, college students can get some money from their part-time job, it also reduce their parents' burdens, too. They must sure that they use their money carefully, use it with the good things not spend it extravagantly and don't forget to save it for their future. It is no good working too long time with the part-time job, it will harm yourself and affect to your study. So, you have to choose the part-time job that the time is appropriate for college students. Some students spend their free time to do a part-time job, I think it is a good idea because they did not use their time to do something that useless such as playing games, reading comic books etc. and they know how to manage their time. Every student should try to do a part-time job.",B1
"No, It should not banned all the restaurant. Because nowadays in this world in each country still has the smoker all around the corner. And they have the right to be the restaurant's customer. But I think the Government or any organization that may concern should build the law or rules about smoking in the restaurant it should have order to organize the specific area or build the small room for smoker in each restaurant. Or build the specific restaurant for only smoker. But in all of these cases the smoker should be aware and realize to the other that can be affected from smoking of them. But in the other hand, the Government should be strict with the law for smoker that smoking in the public place or the forbidden area. If they against the law they should be punished follow the law such as pay the fine. However in the best way every smoker should pay respect for the law and the other personal right and should be smoke in the right place and right time for good reason to spend the life in public place. And in every place not just the restaurant should be strict with law too. If anyone in any place find the smoker that against the law or rules they can sue or punished the smoker follow the law or rules.",B1
"Nowadays a lot of teenagers in Indonesia are students college but the majority of them do not use their time in useful way. It was showed by their habitual action that just coming to the college and go home. Where as in this part of life is very important step to get good future so the have to spend their times in useful ways. Kind of activities that can give advantages for college students such as follow organization and having part time job. But what kinds of activity that can good benefit to us especially can support their economy and acknowledge. The students who want to get kind of advantages can spend their time with having part time job. The students who having part time jobs get kind of advantages such as have experience and adding their pocket money. They will learn how to use their money because they get it by themselves. From having part time job they will more independent and they will not depend on their life on their parents. Beside that, they will get experience such as know other people's character and how to face them, they will easily face and comfort with new situation. So that having part time job is really give advantages for students colleges.",B1
"I agree that it is important for college students to get a part-time job because it is inevitable because of today's society. Abandon the traditional mindset, many college students actually took up a part-time job to earn additional income, thus taking off a huge load from their parents' shoulders and saving for their own future such as school fees for overseas university, which should end up being a significant contribution to the college tuition. Even though academic are the main focus, students also realized the importance of having work experience. Society nowadays expects students to have working experience therefore part-time job are started as early as in college life and internship is included in school modules for students to gain practical experiences off campus and gain nourishment from outer world. Students also understand the benefits of that it would help to foster values, better communication skills, honed time management skills and picking up relevant skills through the working environment thus, it helps to aspire chances with a killer cover letter and resume, standing out and impressed their future employer. In conclusion, taking up part-time job could provide one with endless benefits, enhancing in both academic and social skills and such skills help students to stay ahead before entering into the working world.

" As far as I'm concerned, part-time job is necessary for college students at present. Because taking a part-time job dose have many advantages. Here are some of them. First of all, college students themselves have the required skills. Compared to senior high school students, college students have much more leisure time and they are older so that they can take good care of themselves. They can do whatever they want to do without the permission of parents and teachers. So they have the time and ability to take a part-time job. Besides, as a college students, we should learn to be independent from our parents. We can make some money by taking a part-time job. At the same time, it can provide us with some experience which is necessary in our life. It can also be fun and interesting. Last but not least, when we take a part-time job, we will meet many people who take varieties of jobs. Dealing with these people can improve our communicate skills and lay a basic foundation for our future career. Of course, whether taking a part-time job is up to you. If you are busy with study, you don't need to take it. but if you have the time and urge and the will to challenge yourselves, you'd better have a try.",A2
"Smoking is a bad behavior that shouldn't do. Smoking have many disadvantages not only can affect a person who smoking only but it can affect people around you also. It can make annoying to people around you. I think we should be completely banned at all especially in public place. Many smokers don't interested in what place they should smoke or not. Their always smoke wherever they want to smoke although that place is a public place such as restaurant park or office. If smoking be completely banned at all not only the restaurant but all public place it so good for anyone who don't smoke because in cigarette smoke have many toxin can affect to respiratory system especially lung and cigarette smoke is a cause of cancer also. Finally it good for everyone if smoking be completely banned at all and it will be better if we can banned cigarette too. The government may release some policy too stop these people who want to smoke in restaurant and public area. It may help the country to be better. Who doesn't smoke will be safe from a danger of smoke such as kids, ladies, old people or anyone who doesn't support to have smoking. Not only the areas will be clean from cigarettes, the air is still fresh and good for living.",B1
"I don't agree with the statement. It is true that smoking has bad affections for human body. Recently, it is said that the smoke from tobaccos makes human's lungs bad. This means that people who smoke expose others in danger of becoming ill, especially becoming lung cancer, and dying. People who smoke may become killers sometimes. However, if we completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country, this means that we just care about people who don't smoke. We should think about the rights of people who smoke. They have rights to smoke when they want to do. To protect both rights of people smoke and don't smoke, we should do something, for example, dividing space into a smoking area and a non-smoking area, making a closed space for smoking and so on. We should make our society comfortable for everyone, both people who smoke and don't smoke. So we need to not only do the things I told above but also know about how bad smoking is, why some people really need to smoke, why some people can't quit smoking and so on. Thus, I don't agree with the statement; smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"I agree the statement. That is, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, there are some reasons. First, some of them must earn money as the cost of living themselves. In my case, money for rent is given by my parents' home. But, I must pay almost of the cost of eating by myself. The person whose environment is like me is being everywhere. Second, if they have enough of money, they would be able to buy a lot of things. For example, clothes, books, comics, and so on. We can buy whatever you want. Third, to communicate with other people, enough of money is precious. I sometimes go to a movie theater to see a movie with my friends. Money needs for it. Of course, money is not always needed to communicate with others. But, most of the chance, money is precious. Finally, to work somewhere is good experience. Not only college students but also high school students can work. But, for high school students, it is much more important to study than to work. And, some of college students will get a job after graduation. In that case, the experience of working is important. That's why that I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"Smoking gives pleasure to some people but we all know that cigarette smoking can harm us, so it must be banned in our country especially in all restaurants. Why most important in restaurants? Simply because we can find restaurants in public areas where it can be easily find. Smoking in a place where you are exposed with others is not a good trait. Children might think that what you are doing is not bad. They might try to do it too because they might be curious of what does it feels to take cigarettes. As an adult or a smoker (even if you're young), we should be responsible for all the things that we are doing. We must think first if it can also harm others, not just all the human beings but also our environment. Also, smoking in a public area can harm those who will smell or take in the smoke of the cigarette much affected by the one who is really smoking. When smoking is already banned in all restaurants in Philippines and in other countries, it is a big help to lessen our problems regarding with the air we breathe in.",B1
"I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because there are a lot of nonsmoking people who hate the smoke. I think it is important for Japanese people not to smoke too much. In Europe, people are accepting the trend of nonsmoking in public facilities. Japanese people should be more active to reduce the number of victims of lung cancer that is caused smoking too. In order to make the smoker give up smoking, the government should put more tax on tobacco, and the company which produces tobacco should withdraw from the business of tobacco. If the government put more tax on tobacco, the income will increase and the financial condition of the Japanese government will improve. As for the production of tobacco, in fact, JT, which is the only tobacco producing company in Japan has started withdrawing from the tobacco business. I think that the worldwide tobacco boom has ended. So, the day will soon come when smokers are avoided not only in the restaurant but also in everywhere. If they ban smoking at a restaurant, the number of customers may decrease. But if they ban smoking at all the restaurants, the smokers may give up smoking at restaurant and go to restaurant without smoking.",A2
"I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job because money is very important and we are life very funny. There must be money to live a rich life. Hang out with friends, you need to get that money also can live and travel food. College students eat a lot to drink so money is a very important resource. If the parents and help you at work part-time and extra money Proficient leisure life. If part-time job to earn money and have a good experience. Through experience can be helpful in social life. Filial to their parents for earning money and making money as they could survive the book. And the savings are able to help in the future when he was home. At other times, you can work part-time, but the money that vacation. And I have to earn the money their parents can offer you a worry-free.

" I hate the smell of the cigarettes. As a result of this, I support all the smoking-forbidden activities, though some of my families have the bad habit of smoking. This time is no exception, either. I positively agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking not only does harm to the smokers, but also leaves a bad influence on the people around them-we just call those ""second-hand smokers"". Restaurants are the places where people eat food. If someone else smokes here, the other people in the restaurant just become the second-hand smokers. They always ""eat"" the smoke into their body while they are having the food. As we all know, smoke is harmful, especially to the children and the pregnant women. Restaurants are the public places, so the government should take the benefits of all the people into consideration. What's more, smoking while eating is a behavior that lacks respect for others. For the smokers own, they will give a terrible impression on the rest of the people. And the more serious consequence is that you may ruin your figure which you set up carefully. I guess that the people who are used to smoking have a completely different idea. They might think smoking-banned in the restaurants harms their rights. What we can do for this is to set aside a room as smoking room for smokers. However, all in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I will always be on this side.",B1
"I think that it is great for college students to have a part-time job, but for the sake of argument I will be taking the opposite side, that is, the side of things college student should not have a part-time job. When a college student has a part-time job, they basically have an excuse to not focus very hard on their schoolwork. It's basically like giving them a free pass to under achieve. College students in many ways already have an occupation and that occupation is to go to school. Furthermore, part-time work is very boring and not a lot of college students like to do boring things. We want to have fun and experience a lot of new things in college, but we have our whole lives to work but we don't have our whole lives to have fun. Also, it is very hard to find a part-time job that is flexible enough and allows studying so that students could use their time effectively even while working. The best work study positions are taken by the smartest kids and the employers to want to hire anyone who doesn't have a 4. 0 GPA. For these reasons, college student should focus on other things that part-time work while they are in college.",C2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, It reduces harmful effect of second-hand smoking. If smoking is free at restaurants, it may have a bad effect on non-smokers. Especially, the old and the infirm have great damage. Exposure to second-hand smoke can slow children's body growth owing to causing gene modification and easily bring about getting cancer. And it is quite probable that children who are exposed to passive smoke catch the cold. Also, involuntary smoking during pregnancy can cause serious health problems to a fetus. Second, It is because if small place starts banning smoking, our country's may tend to take it for granted that people are non-smoker. These days some people have a hard time resting of life because of lung cancer. They are very sorry that they start smoking. But if we carry out this rule, it can reduce smokers and prevent teen's smoking. For these reasons, I really agree about that. However, of course it may exits a restaurant owners who think that their sales fall. I'd like to tell them, ""Having a long-range view is better than only thinking your profits. "" And I want all people to be freed of smoking at the restaurants and be healthy.",B2
Part time jobs are necessary for the students who are studying abroad. Because their family have no more resources to educate them more. The students who have resources of education they does not done this job. But the students almost done the job foe money and for learning. But the students who done the part time jobs they cannot done their studies as well as they done when they are come to their houses at night they are tired and does not prepare their college work. And their studies are destroy by this way. But if the students have need for this jobs for their family supporting they have need to work hard they should wanted that they managed the time by their part time jobs and study. First of all the Government should to releze the funds for these students and help them. The part time job has bad effect on the students. They have bad result in their studies. Because they have not time for studies. Their health is not remain as a healthy students. Is they have a chance to study they will done more hard work for their studies and for their country. Through the work of hard working their health will bad. Actually the college is the place where the students studying well and enjoy their life as well. They done. Because money is the responsibility of the government not the students of the college their responsibility is study.,B1
"Smoking is a vice in today's society. Governments also introduce many policies and laws to discourage people from smoking and to promote healthy lifestyles. These days, we also see many places banning smoking within the premises. However, I feel that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It takes time for smokers to quit smoking. If they are completely banned at all the restaurants, it will cause much inconvenience and difficulty to them. They will need to look for suitable places to take a puff and this may be a hassle for most of them. Hence, this may cause distress and smokers may be less motivated to quit smoking because they feel that they are discriminated against by society. Moreover, it may lead to decreased sales for some restaurants which cater mainly to smokers, which may be situated near night clubs and pubs. There will be fewer people who patronize these restaurants and hence, these outlets may close down in the future. Thus, I propose that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. Instead, a small smoking zone could be set up outside the restaurants for smokers, away from the non-smokers who dine in the restaurant. This way, it will make the dining experience a more memorable and relaxing one. ",B1
" Absolutely, it is necessary. There are many advantages for us who take part-time jobs. First of all, as a college student, we do not have any income. So a part-time job can bring us more freedom on shopping on our own. For example, a friend of mine is on a work-study programme, every month she gets one hundred and fifty Yuan. As a result, she can use her own money to buy her favourite things or things she needs. What is more, she feels happy when she uses the money which comes from her own labour. Second, a part-time job can bring us working experience, which we merely have but all companies attach importance to. It is also the most important reason. There are more and more college students every year hunting for jobs. Companies value working experience specially. So it is more and more essential to gain more experience. Last, we can grow up through a part-time job. If we meet difficulties, we must learn how to solve them. That is a process of growing, too. As the old saying goes ""No pains, no gains"". By taking part-time jobs, college students can learn a lot that cannot exist on textbooks or classroom. As college students take more part-time jobs, they have a better chance to know what the society is like, and adapt to the shift in society easily. According to all these reasons, we can draw a conclusion that part-time job is necessary for college students. It is obvious that college students can benefit great from part-time jobs.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to many medical researches, they show that cigarettes are harm for human. It may cause the disease of lung, moreover, may lead the cancer. That is why I think that cigarettes may even not be produced. Most worst of all, the container of cigarettes will make people addict to so it is hard for those who likes smoking to quit it. Nevertheless, more and more reports show that smoking is only harm for smoker but anyone who breathe smoke in. I think it is unfair for people, who don't smoke, be compelled to smoke. There is the only method to protect no-smokers, forbidding smoking in public. So the government tried to carry out a policy that all indoor space, including restaurant, should ban for smoking. We all know restaurant is a good place for all children, adults and older to relax and eat delicious dishes. If someone smokes beside you and you are a nonsmoker, can you still eat as nothing happen? Or you may shout with angry at the unpleasant man? I trust most will act like latter. Although the policy may cause unhappiness from smoker, I think it should not be given up. After all, it is about whole human's heath. Now that, we all know smoking will harm for us, why don't we agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants?",B1
"I think it shouldn't be completely banned. It should not completely but selectively banned. Above all, I am also a person who likes smoking after having some meals, finishing something, and having some coffee, but it is usually banned in most of restaurants except for pubs, or bar. It is certain that non-smokers don't want to be with smokers who are smoking, and indirect smoking is more harmful than direct smoking. I understand it as well. However, smoker's rights of smoking in public area also exist. Because cigarettes are also products which tobacco company wants to sell customer, and customers want to use it anywhere despite of in public area. Additionally, governments should provide them some smoking districts in public area, because taxes of cigarettes are so high. In other words, Heavy smokers are very sincere large taxpayer. So I'll suggest a solution. We divide the restaurants into two areas such as smoking area and non-smoking area. When smokers are with smokers in smoking area, they would feel comfortable if they smoke. It is the possible situation smokers don't like the smoking smell; however, they are more understandable than non-smokers. If we do like that, we didn't argue about this topic again. I think it is the best solution which is considering both smoker and non-smoker.",B2
"What do you think about smoking in the public places? I think it should not be allowed. Refer to many years researching, the result that; almost of the people think negative about it. Do you know? More than 80% of the restaurants in Thailand have been banned the smoking and if anyone smokes they will be fined for 2, 000 baht. But in the past time, smoking has been allowed for every restaurant, pub and club. That was very uncomfortable for the people who are a non-smoking person. They would inhale the smoke and get it more than the smokers. Right now there are the ways to solve this problem, the first one is fine and the second is set the smoking zone in the public places and restaurants so far from everyone. Smoke, there are many toxic and disadvantage, that is the good idea to protect ourselves from that. I'm very sure that you want to be happy when you have a dinner with a fresh air without smoke, smell bad and toxic. I don't blame that the smoker is the bad person but your smoking is affected to the other people and makes the people around the smokers get the carcinogen, Of course it should be completely banned!",B1
"Smoking is something that teenagers today are popular smoking same fashion without knowing the penalty for smoking tobacco. Smoking is addictive substance that is harmful to the body. Smoking is not just physical abuse male smoking itself only to hurt people around you and the environment as well I think smoking in restaurants is not appropriate because the department is most people come to eat and maybe have children to eat by smoking is not suitable to smoke in restaurants because it is a danger to people nearby. They like to smoke but other don't so don't hurt people who want to eat by having smoking inside the restaurants. The servers should tell them to stop because they hold the right to tell customers in the restaurants not the customers. If the servers cannot handle it they should tell the managers or the owners to get rid of that person. I mean to take them out the restaurants but before that they must try to talk with the smokers nicely. If the smokers still acting rude to them. I think the guard should throw them out of the restaurants and ban them to come back again ever. Thus, smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants.",A2
"Recently, many regulations about smoking are enforced. For instance, in some area if people walk with smoking, they are fined. This rule is wonderful for non-smokers! I'm 18 years old so I cannot smoke. But I don't want to smoke. Smoking hurt feelings. When you eat lunch with your friends, next customer is smoking. Then what do you think? Perhaps you think nasty, you do nothing but complain about the smoker with them. Eventually you spoil lunch time. What's more, smoking destroys our body. By smoking, our stomach is dirty. And compared with non-smokers, smokers are apt to get cancer. The death rate of smokers is also very high than non-smokers. That is to say, smokers want to die quickly. Smokers say that smoking is our pleasure. But I cannot understand their words. When I was 8 years old, I smoked once. It was too hard for me to smoke to end. What on earth is pleasure? Probably, there is no advantage to smoke. I hope that one day tobacco will be clear completely. It is the best means for the world. We want to get very clear air.",B1
"I don't agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job, besides they must. Taiwan's education is not similar to U. S; we don't have many vary choice to choose which one we like or want to touch in school. Only in college, we choose many way to learn, even you are not major the department, you also can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can touch many vary things, and you can control what time you want to go to school except major classes. How many classes you have touched? Except major classes, you have much time to do you want to do, you might want to rest instead of in class all day, you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long will you stay in college? General students are 4 years in Taiwan, you spend one third times of 4 years to major classes, and more than one third to other classes, the rest of time is not much to you to do anything you want to realize deeply. Sometimes, you thought money is most important to your life, but, to my opinion, learning is really the most important.",B1
"If you Smoking in the restaurant it is wrong and if you smoking it you will have cancers. It is terrible and dangerous for you and everybody is near you. To smoking is make a food is not delicious. I think to smoke is very terrible for me. I halt it. I feel bad every time is I live among some people to smoke it because I must smell it. I can not live with some people to smoke it. I will be going out a place now. In my family do not have some people to smoke it. I feel so good. My father same me he is not like some people to smoke it because to smoke bad smells. Why people like to smoke it? It very bad if you smoking it because you have cancers in yourself. I want to have law is not smoking but it difficult is stop it. It is late is will be stop people do not smoking. In present have advertising is not to smoke near people because it attacks some people. So you should be do not to smoke it in a place is have a lot of people e. g. restaurant, garden, bus stop etc.",B1
"I think that the part-time job plays the important part of college students' lives, so it is necessary for them. I'll write why I think so. Firstly, students can know the system of the society that they live in through the job. Nowadays, it becomes the social problem that a lot of people give up their jobs in few years. Of course, the reasons why they gave up their jobs are valuables, but there could be some people who are not able to be used to working. Though working is the one of the obligations of Japanese, those who got used to living the rich lives without working are tend not to continue their jobs. If they could know the mean of working through the part-time job, they would continue their jobs. Secondly, the part-time jobs give students a kind of confidence because they are given their own part, whatever they are big or small, in their workplaces. It is like club or circle's activity, but the part-time job is unique at the point that those who are various age or social standpoint need them. That is why I think that the part-time job is necessary for the college students. Of course, some people say that it is ridiculous for students to work for little money neglecting their duty ""studying"". However, I think college students do various things that they can do only in this time.",B1
"Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. Restaurants in general have two types of seating available: smoking and non-smoking. Such an arrangement is fundamentally due to legislative reasons such as the prohibition of smoking indoors. However, this also gives customers a choice on where they would like to be seated. In the smoking areas of the restaurants, customers are generally more relaxed and at ease because they are free to smoke as they wish. Smoking is after all, a personal lifestyle choice. As such, why should anyone be deprived of the right to make a choice for himself? If we are concerned that secondhand smoke may irritate other restaurant guests, then there may be a problem with the seating arrangement of the restaurant. The smoking and non-smoking areas should not be too closely located so as to respect the choices of both groups of customers. There is no reason to ban smoking in restaurants just because we want to ensure that non-smokers are not affected by the secondhand smokes. Such a move would be as extreme as saying smoking should be allowed anywhere and everywhere so as to accommodate the needs of smokers. I firmly believe that there should always exist a balance between any decisions. ",B2
"Part-time work is an activity that can help a person in everyday life even in the future. For example if someone has done his part-time job at the young, he can easily blend in to his original work later and already accustomed to work, other than getting the experience he can also get extra money for himself. Many part-time job that can be done as become employees of restaurants or shop keeping. Usually part-time work is done during the holidays, but some also work part time during college years. Part-time job could also add insight. In part-time work is a good idea if the same field of profession you can do well in college because it can lead to increased insight into the world of jobs. Part-time work also forms the character of a person starts from the leadership, or team work in a world of work Therefore especially young men and women do not just stay quiet when having a lot of free time. They need use the free time it was to work part time because we can develop the characters and also add insight as well and experience. I believe that part time job is necessary for college students because the experience they get will be useful for them later.",B1
" I have saw some adults even teens smoking in public places more than once. Actually, I am very against such behavior. As for myself, the smelling of smog makes me feel awful. Besides, there are lots of reasons proving that smoking should be forbidden in public places. First, it is reported that if a smoker is smoking in a room, the health of other people who would breath in the poisonous smog around the smoker will be affected. Meanwhile, when people smoke in the public places, the air of the public places will be polluted. So it is no wonder that some public places have set the smoking room or smoking zone. Even so, smoking in public places shouldn't be promoted. Second, I believe that everyone might know that smoking is bad for our health, but why do so many people cannot stop smoking? Because smoking can addict people easily. Once you have a try, you cannot reject it. So the forbid of smoking in public places is of great importance in the term of the health of civilian people. Third, sometimes many dangerous accidents are caused by smoking. For example, when you are smoking in the gas station, the spark of cigarette may set fire to the gasoline escaping from the fuel tank, and cause big explosion. Considering from people's health or the security of society, the advantages of smoking in public places are much more than the disadvantages. We shall forbidden the smoking in public places for a better future.",B1
"Nowadays, when you are in a coffee, a hotel, or a restaurant, you can always see that someone is smoking. As is known to all that smoking is a form of self-battering that those who must sit by, occasionally joke or complain, and hopeless watch. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. To begin with, it is harmful for public health. The restaurant is the public site. There are always many people eating. If there is someone smoking, all the people sit around him will breathe in the smoke. It does harm to not only himself but also the others. Moreover, it influences others' regular meal. There is no doubt that there is no man is willing to have a meal in a place which is full of smoke. The restaurant is the place intended for eating. All the action which will do harm to the guests' eating should be banned. Last but not the least, smoking is not being encouraged among the public. On the contrary, the government is advocating the citizens to abandon smoking. Smoking at the restaurant is in contradiction with this. As far as I am concerned, banning smoking at the restaurant will build a harmonious situation for meal. And it is also beneficial for the ones who want to quit smoking. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants immediately.",B1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We should do a lot of things in our life as many as possible. When we are college students, we have free time very much. So we have chance to do a lot of things. We should have a part-time job even if only one because it teach us the importance of earning and working for people. My parents send me money now, so I do not know the importance of earning and working for people. If I would not work until graduating *** University and I would start to work not as student, what happened to me? I think I could not go well in the company and the society because I do not know the importance of earning and working for people. And a part-time job teaches us that it is hard and difficult to work to get money. No matter how hard we work for an hour, we often get 800 yen or so. Probably we think ONLY 800! I think, when we understand those importance, we will know appreciate my parents as Thanks to my parents working hard, I can go to *** University and learn. That may be most importance of having a part-time job.",A2
"My topic is that part time job is necessary for college students. First of all I want to say here is that to do job is necessary for every person to exist in this social network. As we have to be a social person. And by this job we make money, so when we have a decent amount of money; we can exist and survive in this world more easily. But according to this topic, in which it is said part time jobs are necessary for students. Ok, now see just when we hear the word part time we become uneasy because this demands more energy from our side which just irritates the student. It is more painful for a student because in the day time they have to do study and if after that they will do job then it will be too much and their routine will also be disturbed. But some poor students who are facing some financial problems, they have to do part time jobs to survive in this cruel society. As we know that this is the age of NAFSA NAFI, no one thinks about even his real brother, no one help you when you will be in any kind of problem, we are to help ourselves. In other word I can say that this society doesn't allow a poor person to live freely. The only person is honored in this world who is rich in wealth, it doesn't see weather he is rich in knowledge or not. In the end I want to say that jobs are necessary but not for students because if they do so, they can't concentrate on their studies which will result in the bad future of the students and my beloved country Pakistan.",B1
"In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details. Generally, young people have many important tasks to do in schools. They have to study several stressful subjects and join in a lot of helpful activities. Personally, I think that although teenagers work hard in schools, they need to have jobs to get a great experience that they can never found in schools. First of all, to help their parents, young people should do part time jobs. Nowadays, many businesses provide suitable positions and reasonable income for students. For example, I used to work with Mc Donald as a cashier when I was a student in high school in Bangkok. This position required me to work 21 hours per week and paid me about 700 baht. With this money, I could have an expense for traveling cost from my home to my school. It might not large money, but I felt proud that I could help my parent with this money that I belonged. Finally, not only can teenagers learn how to work with other people, they can also learn what they actually like. The more jobs they participate in the more chances they obtain to know different characters of different jobs. Moreover, they can plan what they have to learn that will be useful for their favorite jobs. Therefore, students who work and study together will not do any mistake about choosing their appropriate career like other lazy students who never paid any attention for a part time job.",B1
"I agree with the point. Nowadays, there is a hot discussion about whether smoking should be banned all the restaurants. People who smoke argue that it takes away their freedom. However nonsmokers advocate it is a good rule. From my perspective, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking which will bring many diseases does harm to our health. Besides, smoking gives much gas off into air, which pollutes our environment. What' more, many people cannot put up with the smoking gas, which makes them sick. It is not surprising that smoking banned in all restaurants will promote workers efficiency. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to us to ban smoking in all restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he can smoking in private. My suggestion is that they should give up smoking. It is beneficial to both our health and environment. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Only in this way can we breathe more flesh air in the future!Today more and more people all over the world want to give up smoking. If you're not a smoker, don't start. In fact, smoking is a bad habit, which has great harm to people's health.",B2
"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Why I think so is that college students are semi-working people. To work is one of the important things for people to live in a society. So I think to have a part-time job is important. For example, I work in the private school as a teacher. In the work, I learn many things, that is to say, common senses. I think those senses are necessary to live in a society. Part-time job is very appropriate to practice to lead your life in society, I think. And, to earn money is another thing important for college students. We are not working adults. But, we are not entirely children, too. So I think, college students have to work to earn money, which they use for them to go shopping, drink, or travel. The money for their leisure must be paid by their own. I, too, pay my train fare. Eventually, what I want to say is part-time job is a way to study what society is. To learn that is difficult, so part-time job is surprisingly useful for that. If it was a trivial experiment, we study something advantageous for us.",B1
"As we all know, college students have a lot of time to live their own life. They can control their life freely and do what they like and what they want. People are discussing whether it is important for college students to do part-time job. Like one coin has two sides, advantages and disadvantages exist as to it. On the one hand, it is good for us to have a part-time job. To start with, along with the high pace of the modern world, more and more companies pay more attention to word experience. They must do a good job to promote their ability. Their practice will enable them to better understand what they learned from books. Students can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job-hunting. What's more, they can earn some money though these experiences. It can make the students realized that it is hard to make money. One of the most important reasons is that let them know the hardship of making money. Then they can develop a habit of saving money. During this period they can know how much they owe to them. Part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families and cannot afford to pay college fees. Last but not the least, it opens them a window to know about the society, which is essential to their maturity. On the other hand, if we break the balance our study and work, it makes no sense. Study is of importance to us students. We must spend most of our time in study to reach our goal. We must deal with our study and work well, spend their spare time taking part-time jobs. Only following this principle can they benefit from their part-time jobs.",B1
"I know smoking is harmful to health, but the people who started out of curiosity are most common. In addition, many people started out of curiosity during adolescence are the person who initiated the most common. However, it will be harmful to young people who are exposed to that sad reality is that they have not. If parents have children who smoke increased the odds seem better. Because my parents are smoker I'll smoke a cigarette? Have to think that smoking is addictive from the moment it is fatal. Tobacco is a sign that food is a problem. Continue to sell tobacco as a drug with the wrong, you can purchase and Think that did it. A tobacco addiction to quit asking to hear someone who's already seems to be abandoned late. In my opinion, Tobacco is not starting from scratch, is an alternative method I know that smoking is not good is the majority who do not hang up. Smokes parents about the child is not eligible for scolding seems to. Curiosity of a child with a problem that's not much, but exposure to such situations, parents at the beginning of the fault seems to be even greater. That must not ignore someone smokes",B1
"Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? It is necessary for me. There are two points support my thought: First, if I have a part-time job during my university life, I will acquire more experience than other students who doesn't have jobs. Second, having a part-time job is an efficient way to make lots of friends and expand our sights. Sitting in classrooms to study books vary far from working outdoors or in an office. To my appointment, it is no challenging to contact with books every day because they are non-living. That is to say, they can't talk to you, argue with you, and even reject you. But people are different. They will blame you or let you very embarrassed in front of everybody. So, to avoid such as conditions occur, we ought to accumulate our working experience in teenagers. But, I not only do not pay attention to my school work, but also regard my school work as a foundation. Because, having enough knowledge from textbooks is a basic of success. Although my parents don't want me to earn money now, I still desire to acquire some working experience to prepare my future. Regardless of I longed to attain experience at the moment, I will still do my best at my education to full of knowledge.",B1
"As for banning smoking in restaurants, I absolutely believe smoking should be banned. Furthermore, why stop with restaurants? Before I address this question I will give my reasons why I believe smoking should be banned in ALL restaurants. To begin, let's start with the obvious. It has been scientifically proven that second hand smoke has enough toxins to cause lung cancer and many other diseases such as heart disease. In the very worst situations second hand smoke causes death. At the very least, simple discomfort is caused by second hand smoke. From the worst to the least there are countless reasons smoking in restaurants should be banned. Not only should it be banned, in my solicited opinion, it should be illegal. I feel there should be consequences for people who smoke and create a dangerous environment simply because they feel they have the freedom to do as they wish with their lives. I believe these incredibly selfish people lack respect for others. They feel that by not smoking is asking too much of them, as they are basically drug addicts. Everyone knows that drug addicts do not consider others when they need their drug of choice. These selfish people also have polluted ideas of what personal freedoms really are. I do believe smokers have the right to smoke and should be permitted to smoke regardless of the medical consequences. However, I do not believe that society should not be held responsible for the medical costs caused by smoking. Now, to address my earlier question, I believe smoking should be banned in all public areas. And I mean all public areas. Smoking should only be permitted in one's home. That's it! They should not be permitted to smoke outside their own home. Not even in their yard.",C2
"I don't agree with this statement that college students should have a part-time job because I feel that they have many other priorities that should come ahead of whatever small money they might be able to make by having a part-time job. Students who flounder their time on part-time work will undoubtedly find that their grades are slipping, and this is something that can affect their entire future because once you get some bad grades, it is very difficult to bring your GPA back up. Of course many companies would like for students to have a part-time experience, but a good GPA is also a good way of showing that you are responsible and hardworking. I think that students should be able to have the liberty to take the time after graduating to learn more about being really serious in working, so they should save part-time employment for immediately after graduation or for maybe in the summers when they don't have as much to do. Therefore, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job as any benefits they might gain will be offset by the gains they will make after graduation and enrollment in the industry.",C2
"I don't agree with the statement; it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think, it's important for students who are interested in having one, but not for all college students. Indeed, having a job in one's early time can be a good experience for his/her full-time work after graduation or his/her dairy life by learning social rules and communicating with other people. But, for ones who don't direct to part-time jobs, including me, working can be worthless or even painful because part-time jobs are instable in situations, working places and colleagues, on part-time job students can earn less money in contrast to his/her contribution, and at the largest point, students are fully busy in college lives. Many college students must do homework and come to university for a long way. They are also expected to do extra studies before and after lectures. So they have a little time to spend freely. A part-time job spends his/her precious time. In fact, I have only 9 lectures a week now, including 4 lectures with homework, but I have time for my hobby only on Saturday and Sunday. Even then, of course, I have to study so that the length of the free time depends on the contents of the lectures and homework. Certainly there are students who have some time and students who are attracted in working on part-time jobs. People like them will have a good time with their colleagues and customers, a pleasant of earning money, and so on. I don't deny the people getting them with their own wills. But I think it's not good to force all college students to get part-time jobs, telling that they must be good for them. Weather having a job or not should be decided by students' own.",A2
"I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking is very bad for your body. I don't like smoking because it makes me cough and it makes my throw hurt very badly. I don't like it when my friends smoke around me because the same thing happens. I don't understand how they can breathe that stuff into their lungs, because it is full of bad stuff and makes your mouth very dry. It also makes your teeth yellow and makes your clothes stink. Even some of my girlfriends who are smokers who think they don't smell bad still have the cigarette smoke smell around them. This makes it hard to be in the car with them or otherwise be around them. I bet that a lot of young Japanese girls feel the same way as I do. I bet that they think it would be a good idea to ban smoking especially in restaurants. Otherwise, they probably would not have asked me this question. Smoking is also bad for your clothes. It makes them smell bad, and if you get ash on them it is very difficult to get it off. Also, all the boys I talked to say that they do not like to kiss girls who smoke, so I think that is a good reason to have abstained from smoking too.",C2
"All of everyone wants a wonderful and colorful life at college. Except studies, relationship, entertainments and love life, having a part-time job is also important. Doing part-time jobs is not only making money for extra expenses but also giving those college students a work experience to learn and taste something new. It's more and more importance for employers to employ someone with work experiences than with a high educational background now. The college students can find their interests about their future work, and then experience what they need to personally do. They can also improve their talents, and enter the company they'd like to be employed in if they do their best and expand. Their excellent talents even. In another word, a good part-time job is a kind of paths to get a good job in the future. Every kind of part-time jobs will make the employed learned. A restaurant waitress or waiter will learn how to serve customers and solve the complaint of customers. A baby sitter will be able to appease babies and know how to take after them. They can learn some talents and the way to control their emotion. Otherwise, doing part-time jobs will build the sense of responsibility to these students, and discover the other interests and talents. No matter what kind of part-time jobs, after the part-time job, the college students will attain a lot of experiences to full of their life and their resume.",B1
"I agree with that statement. In a university, students are regarded as adults, not children. It is a big difference between university and high school. Surely, they are not prefect adults, but should try to be them. Working is good experience for them. For example, they can talk to someone they might not see without working, old man, foreigner or a man prone to be angry or make you angry. They can see what companies do for their benefit. They can do them if they have a part-time job. Therefore, having a part-time job is important for college students. Of course, a part-time job is not an only important thing. They should study and think about their future. If they are not conscious of those experience and work for just earning money, having a part-time job is not so important. I think for college students to experience many things, the part-time job which you can work just one time or a few times is good. Having a part-time job, they can make many friends. The friends come from different university. So they can get other university's information. University students are not prefect adults and are in the process of becoming them. To be them, they should practice, such as a part-time job.",B1
"Did you ever have lunch in a restaurant with smoke? It is definitely smelly and harmful for all the human-beings. Then, would it have to be banned in all the restaurant? That is a good question we have to discuss. Some who agree to ban smoking said they will be harmed by those smoke. And it would cause a number of diseases such as heart diseases or lung cancer. As we all know, everyone does not want to get sick. Banning smoking in restaurant can make the air becomes fresh, everyone here is more likely to dine there. However, those who disagree with the ban are that it is not fair to them. Some of the restaurants have separate into two areas-smoking area and non-smoking area. Those who don't want to smoke can go to the non-smoking area and just dine there. Some restaurants even just banned all the smoking events. Different people can go to their area whatever they want. It is no contradiction. To conclude, although there still exists a controversy, we all know that smoking is harmful for all people. Just take it away as soon as possible.",B1
"It is very popular habit through out the world. People of every corner of the world like it, smoke it and even chew it. Even men, women and even children are addicted to it.

With the arrivals of the Europeans in the 16th century, the consumption, cultivation, and trading of tobacco was quickly spread. Tobacco is most commonly used for smoking. It is smoked, inhaled and even chewed. Initially it was used for medical purposes in the form of hookah. For gas troubling patients, Doctor suggest them hookah. But the passage of time it spread and the other people also strat using it in the form of cigarette Smoking has many dangerous effects on human health. It produce different disease in the smoker such as heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). Cigarette smoking is also the number one cause of bladder cancer. It is said that daily about 3, 900 kids between the ages 12 and 17 start smoking. The number of smokers is increasing daily due to large advertisement by cigarette producing companies.

"I am agree with above topic. In this time, we often meet college students that use their leisure to work in cafÃ©, foodcourt, language school, and etc. Part time job becomes alternative way by college students to spend their leisure. It caused by some reason. First, they want to learn independent life and helps their parents with work, and collect some money to pay their tuition fee without aid from their parents. Even, they can give some money to their parents to buy daily needs for their family. They will feel proud by themselves, because he had felt tobe able handle their problem. The second reason is they want start their entrepreneur career becomes a waitress. And then, they will know the case that becomes to notice in run a business. Even, they can learn marketing technique, marketing tactic, and etc. Third reason is they want to try and improve their hard skill and soft skill talent. All of people must have hard skill and soft skill in any field that they run. If they only have hard skill without soft skill, or they only have soft skill without hard skill, they will eliminate from competition by people that have both of talent. So, they try to improved their hard skill and soft skill talent with part time job. On this way, their communication can be fluently, they can try to convince other people, they have a much relation, and this relation very important to work in company or become an entrepreneur. Anything their reasons, this experiences very helps them to prepare the future life. They will ready to defeat all of disturbance that happen in workplace.

"I agree with this statement. We college students should have a part-time job. One reason is that we need much money. If we belong to some club, we often hold a banquet. And we sometimes go shopping and take a trip with club members or friends. We spend much money on many things. If we don't have enough money, we can't enjoy a precious campus life. We can only enjoy it once. Another reason is that we have to experience many jobs. We will get some job in the future. For this, we have to experience many jobs and know how working is and how we communicate with fellow workers and seniors. Unless we don't gain enough experience, we may fail to some job and not communicate with people well and lose some job. We are already eighteen, nineteen or twenty. We are not children. We are adults. We should not depend on our parents. We have to live our own lives in the future. So, we have to become real adults. However, there are some problems. Firstly, we should not have too many part time jobs. These may make us tired and we may not study. Secondly, we have to select a right job. We should not have a part-time job which we fit with. If we know these problems, we can enjoy a part-time job.",A2
"Many people smoke at the restaurant today. It is very unpleasant and I also hate this. If I see most people who smoke when I have a meal, I will very angry. I also agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. There are two things why I hate people who smoke at the restaurant. First, smoking is not good for health. As you know, many people know this truth and smoking affects other people as well as the smoker. Many non-smokers are suffering from secondhand smoke. Therefore, banning smoking from all restaurants is the only way we can prevent the dangerous things associated with smoking. Second, non-smokers cannot enjoy their meal at the restaurant because of smoker. When I was having my meal at the restaurant, I couldn't eat any more because of cigarette smoke. So, I stopped eating meal. As always, many non-smokers are suffering because of smoker. In conclusion, smoking is not good for human's health as you know and we should protect non-smokers by banning smoking from restaurants. It is very important thing and smokers should not bother the non-smokers also. So, smoking must be perfectly forbidden at all restaurants in the whole country.",B1
"I think it is important to have a part-time job when you are college student. We have to study hard in college but we also have to get to know how to make money. Some people says having part-time jobs take a lot of time to study but I think we can do both of them. And I think if we have part-time jobs we can get chances to learn many things which we cannot learn if we just study in college. And we can make many friends in another field. Such friends give us a lot of information, advice or interesting stories. That helps us a lot, for example, when we at a loss in our life or when we can't find our dream they can solve them. In my case I have two part time jobs. I work at restraint. It tells me that how to make delicious foods and how to speak to the people who come to the restraint. And I teach two elementary school students. It tells me that how to take care of children. These two jobs show me special things which I can't find if I just study in college. So I agree that having a part time job is important.",B1
"When I saw the topic, it is reasonable that smoking should be perfectly banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some (not all) people feel unpleasant about smoking. So do me. They have right to have an enjoyable meal. But, because of the smokers, the people are not being supposed to be disqualified by them. I have an unfavorable experience about this happen. As I went to the Chinese restaurant with my friends, we had the thinking about the luxurious atmosphere, and nice tasty foods. So we were very delighted. At that time, many guests came into the restaurant. Until then the guests did not have to worry about, we felt good. But the moment one of the guests was starting smoking. Then the other guests began smoking after him. Since then, the inside of the room became the fog and the smell of smoke. It was hard to breathe for us because the smoke blocked, and eyes were hurting, too. From then on all of my friends as well as the restaurant began to be offended by the smokers. So, in the end all the more impatient people protested them. The situation was resolved but everyone enjoyed delicious food and deprived of rights became unintentionally. So, I agree to be prohibited from smoking in restaurants.",B1
"I disagree with the statement. Although I am not a smoker, I have friends who are smokers and I empathize with their situation in Singapore, where there are many areas that are out of bounds to smokers. There are even fines if one smokes at bus stops or in other non-smoking areas. Smoking in restaurants can affect many diners, especially if the smoke ""interferes' with their consumption of food. I do agree that it can be uncomfortable for diners and perhaps even irritating. However, I argue that to completely ban smoking in all restaurants is unfair to smokers. There should be a smoking corner or a smoking room instead, which can greatly help smokers take a break and relax in between their meal times. This will definitely be more appreciated than to ban smoking in restaurants entirely. It also infringes on their right and freedom to smoke, which is ironical, especially in a country that promotes freedom and equality. Should the government want to completely ban smoking in a particular area, then why do they even allow the sale of cigarettes in the first place? It is this irony that exists in public places that create confusion and conflict among people, and smokers in particular. ",B1
"These days in Korea, a big issue is a policy against smoking in public places such as bus stations, public buildings, parks and every public spots. According to this policy, smokers must do not smoking general restaurants as well as all sorts of public places. Most smokers say that it is not fair. However, I definitely think that smoking at the restaurant must be prohibited in country. First, smokers should not forget that the restaurant is the public place. Especially, people of all ages and gender visit here to eat some food for their health and rest. If only one person is unpleasant by a smoker in the restaurant, the smoker's behavior is inconsistant with this space. In the second place, second-handing smoking is a big health hazard in the closed place such as the restaurant. I think it is the most serious ploblem. Many reports show that second-handing smoke can be harmful more than direct smoking, and smoking rooms for smokers and nonsmokers in restaurants are not effective. Finally, the restaurant is the place to eat food above all things. Most people are going to the restaurant for a meal, and they want a smoke-free environment. All of the restaurants are pulic place where nonsmoker's rights should be the first consideration. For the all these reasons, I say that smoking should be prohibited completely in all restaurant in country.",B1
"It is not surprising anymore when seeing people carrying a cigarette in their hands no matter whether they are elderly or even teenagers. Many of the university students are also smoking during their university life. Not surprisingly, students do not think that smoking is unhealthy. The age of first attempt of smoking even shows a dropping trend these days. It is not a healthy scenario. Researchers have proved that cigarettes will emit numerous toxic and hazardous particles which cause serious health problem to smokers and even people around them. Although banning smoking at restaurants, for example, may show disrespect to current smoker, it is still necessary to ban smoke in order to protect the victims of second handed smoke. Government should as well put more effort in promoting a smoke-free city and educating the next generation. Meanwhile, measures in supporting people quitting smoking should not be ignored. Without those measures, easily people will begin smoking again. As a result, stop smoking will become meaningless. In conclusion, I do think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.",B1
"Smoking is very bad habit. As a result of which environment is polluted badly. It should be banned every where which the restaurant is a place where people come to eat and to refresh themselves. At these places, if smokers come, due to smoking other people who are eating these are disturbed. Smoke is not only hatful for smoker but also for other people living around him. This smoke contains toxic and handful substrate like nicotine which is toxic for human health. It causes also a liege no of diseases. Those people who are habitual of smoking, they only want to escape from the difficulties in their lives. In restaurant the smoke of cigarette spreads and the nicotine produces lung cancer. This fact is destroying our new and young generating. In restaurants and coffee shops many young smokers also come and after smoking they start making mischievous and their presence effects the families who come here. Smoking should be banned in restaurants because smokers will use cigarette and inhale smoke as well as those people who are sitting in the restaurants, enjoying their meal, will also inhale the polluted are. So, they are a danger, that those people may also get lung cancer. So, in short smokers should not allow having a cigarette, so that they can use them. Or they should be banned from smoking in restaurants. Smoking is very dangerous for human life.",B1

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, many people go to the restaurant at lunch time and dinner time. Restaurants are the place where many kinds of people are. Smoke does their health harm. Many families with children go to the restaurant at dinner. Children are stronger effected than adults. And the research revealed that smoked people are more harmed than smoking people. Secondly, if some people smoke while the other people are having meals, people who are not smoke can't taste their meals very much because of the smoke. Thirdly, students, such as junior high school students and senior high school students, often go to the restaurant. If they see people smoke at the time, they could be affected by the scene. And they begin to be interested in smoke, in spite of be under 20, they could begin to smoke. Lastly, in these days, there are restaurants which is allowed to enter with their pets, for example they are called dog cafÃ©. Not only man but also dogs, smoking may do harm. This is whyâ… agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2

"Restaurants are always supposed to be a place that people can completely enjoy their meals, relaxing their feelings. But let us assume the situation that when you are eating the delicious food. Suddenly, there a man breathes out with the smoke, so you may not want to sit here anymore. Smoking can bother others, and should be completely banned at all the restaurants. China has a large number of smokers. As nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon, they hold the view that smoking should be banned. They complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in public that would greatly harm to their health. As all of us known, smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. And diseases caused by the second-hand smoke are even more serious. Nonsmokers shouldn't be responsible for it, while the smokers should think about more for others. Banning the smoking in the restaurant is to build a better atmosphere for nonsmokers, and also for the smokers, in order to have a good time to eat. It is a problem related to the ethic, which means to consider more about the others' rights, not only thinking for you. Although, there is not a clear law to forbid the behavior, but it counts. It calls for all the people to do something to help!",B1
"In this time of tough job market, we need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to field of study, will give an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that have had some real-world, adult experiences and that can handle yourself outside of campus. Aside from making more employable after college, having a part-time job will help financially. A part-time job can help pay for living expenses, including food, books, things, and clothes. This way, not overwhelmed with monthly payments when find self working a much lower paying job than you had hoped for right after college. Taking on financial responsibility also takes some of the load off of my parents' shoulders if they are helping me with my expenses. Parents will not be around forever, and so you have to gradually become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner begin this process, the easier it becomes and the faster become 100% independent financially. Therefore I agree that it is important for a college student to have a part time job.",A2
"I agree with that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. To study from the books is not enough for students to learn. They have to go outside to discover the real world, and to earn money by themselves. If students have a part-time job, they will know how big is the world so they have to be strong by themselves. When I was a student, I used to play a lot and all I knew is studying and playing. After studying I would just play computer games all the day. I had a part-time job this summer vacation because I found that everybody was always thinking that I am just like a kid. I started to get in touch with my job teammates and the boss. I found that everything is difficult to me and that I have to find answers on my own. In addition, I finally knew that earning money is not easy; I can't waste my money taking from my parents anymore. Moreover, I learned that I have to be more aggressive than I was. To do so, I can learn more in my life and life will become more interesting. Now I am courageous to face the world which will come after graduating. I agree with that having a part-time job for college students is important because it gives students opportunities to learn from the real living world but not books. Students will learn more before they really touch the career.",B1
"Smoking inside restaurants is a big no according to dining etiquette because you are polluting the air that other diners breathe most especially when you are in an air-conditioned area. There may be portions of restaurants that allow its diners to smoke but still the smoke the cigarette emits still travels through the air thus still affecting the other diners. From my own experience, when me and my family were eating at a smoker-friendly restaurant I noticed that one-fourth of the place was designated to be a smoking area, the area was not sparated from the non-smoking area and that the place was air-conditioned so instead of having the aroma of the delicious food that everybody was eating, the restaurant was coated with the odor of scent of cigarette smoke. With the entire restaurant smelling very rancid, we weren't able to enjoy our food and after eating we told ourselves that we would not eat at a smoker-friendly place again. I think that smoking in restaurants should be banned because it is a sign of disrespect toward other diners. Restaurant managers should be aware of this and they should prevent people from smoking inside their establishments to be able to take care of the well-being of their other diners.",B1

Secondly, today's economy has been worse. This influence our family's money. If you have considerate mind, you should think you earn money to lessen parents' worry about tuition fee.

"It is important for college students to have a part-time job as it will inculcate in them the value of balancing their time. This is a skill that will prove to be essential in the ""real world"" (as if the world students live in isn't real enough). In essence, what the ""real world"" refers to is the working world and its context. Learning to balance and organize one's time efficiently and smartly will be a skill that's much-vaunted as we move along. However, as much as it may be important for college students to have a part-time job, one must ensure that it doesn't adversely affect their results. At the point of time where they are studying, the priority of the student is to ensure they graduate with good grades while learning as much as they can in the process. If the job they hold, even if it is only part-time, affects this intended outcome, then it is something that is not beneficial for the student. Instead it will only end up harming the student. Hence, while it might be important for college students to hold a part-time job while they are studying, this must be done without affecting or impacting their studies in a bad way or it will only end up defeating the very purpose of the entire exercise in the first place.

"Smoking is not a good habit for all ages of people, but there are still many people just can't quit it. There are some reasons I think why they can't quit it. First, they have smoked for a long time and it becomes a regular movement in their daily lives. Second, some of them think smoking is a charming behavior and a real man should know how to smoke. Third, some people think only if they smoke can they make friends and be more convenient to communicate with others on business. But they don't see the shortages of smoking. For example, they have to pay much money on buying cigarettes. In addition, smoking will hurt their own and the surrounding people' health. Thus, our government starts to make laws to prevent those smoking lovers smoking in a public place. They can't smoke inside or outside if there are more 2 people. By the way, there are many ways to help them quit smoking. We can find some products which can help people decrease the desire to smoke. Also, we can get some information from the hospitals. All in all, smoking is not good for us. We should quit smoking and also urge our friends not to smoke anymore.",B1

"A student is like an insurance of any thing for country, is should be maintained with attention, firstly it takes from our side but it returns by doubling it up when there are no other sources remained. If we do not care about our precious things, we do not provide them appropriate service these are spoiled & depreciated before the time. Same like with students because they are the Future falcons of a country. We can say that a student's life is the busiest age of his whole life because he learns new things everyday, every hour and every minute. While in practical life he implements these learning to get benefit and to be succeeded in every field of life. Proper environment, able teachers and opportunities to progress are the basic needs of a student. These needs are attained by only few lucky students because these are being costly like every other thing in this country. Government institutes are unable to provide these things because of bribery, corruption, carelessness and such other evils. Blockage of opportunities and limited resources are causing inflation. Income of a common man is same but expenditures are doubling up. The rates of books, notebooks and most importantly fees are going out of hands of even a middle class person. Except these unachievable expenses many of youngsters are so that they are in the age of study but they have to feed their family also, they have to fulfill their educational dues as well as household expenses. That's a tough task and not everyone is capable of such strong responsibility.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. By restaurants, I am referring to proper dining areas, and not places of entertainment like pubs. I would also like to extend the definition of restaurants to include non-air conditioned dining areas such as hawker centres. We are all aware of the harmful effects of third-party smoke, as well as the irritation it brings to non-smokers. Obviously, the negative effects far outweigh any marginal financial gains, if any, restaurant owners can possibly gain. Firstly, why is there a need for smoking areas to be established in dining areas anyway? Dining areas, as the name implies, are for dining. We cannot eat and smoke simultaneously. Even if someone is not dining in the restaurant, he could always excuse himself and go somewhere else for a puff. The urge to smoke can obviously be controlled. It is not as if he would suffer tremendously to take five minutes to go somewhere else to smoke. Furthermore, what is the use of a smoking area if the smoke can diffuse to non-smoking areas? Unless the area is totally blocked and cordoned off, it is totally useless to create such a space. However, the smoke will most likely affect the other diners, such as when people enter the smoking area, the smoke diffuses out. If it is far from the main dining area, then there is no need for the creation of it in the first place. Smokers may have the freedom to smoke, but non-smokers have their right to dine in a pleasant environment with clear air, especially since they are paying for it. Smokers can just smoke somewhere else, but diners have no other similar alternatives. ",B1
"Smoking is bad to our health. It causes lung cancer and other kind of sickness that we can get from smoking. Many cases also are also from smoking that at early age they are starting smoking and dying also early. We have this mentality also that if we know someone is smoking we are telling that this person's life is short because of how he abuses his body with smoking. Banning the smoking in all restaurants in the country may help one person refrain from smoking. The smoke of the cigarette affects also the people around the person smoking. It can cause also some sickness to the person who inhaled the smoke. Being banned in the restaurants can minimal these cases. Somehow, it also helps our environment healthier. It will make the ambiance inside the restaurant greater. It will encourage more customers to eat in a particular restaurant. It makes healthier place to be in and enjoying the stay without any bad smell of the smoke of the cigarette. I do agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because I hate the smell of it and I know it's not good for me. I hope also that smoking should minimize in our country or maybe should be gone in our daily living so we can have a healthier life.",B1
"This year, Japan government has started the Taspo which is a card system to be intended to prevent under 20s from purchasing any cigarettes by vending machines.

Recently, it is that expanding people regard smoking as perfect evildoing. In this current, it is natural that smoking is prohibited at all the restaurants. It is to be well known and the smoking person begins the disease of the breathing system in several times compared with the person who doesn't. Also, if they are near the habitually smoking person, their risk to become a lung cancer with the passive smoking has become high. The persons who are too young to be permitted to smoke come to the restaurant.

"Although some people think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country; I hold a different opinion on this issue. First, everybody knows that smoking is not only bad for those who smoke, but also for those who do not smoke. This is very unfair for those who do not smoke. They do not like the smell of smoke, but they still have to bear it and their health conditions are affected. The only way to protect those who do not smoke is totally banned smoking to all the restaurants in the whole country. Second, more people's lives will be saved by doing so. My grandfather did not smoke at all, but he died of lung cancer. It was because that many of his friends smoke. If this law could come earlier, many people would not die of lung cancer. Third, restaurant is a place of people to have meal instead of smoking. Those who smoke should not come to restaurant to smoke. If they want to smoke, they should go to smoking area. Jump to the conclusion, since a lot of survey already pointed out that smoking is bad for people's health, we should have strict laws to restrict this bad thing, or more people would die of second-hand smoke.",B2
"Some of the richest people in Indonesia come from cigarettes factories. That's not the one. But the most income for Indonesia also comes from cigarettes factories' tax. But, is smoking is important for Indonesia? Actually no, especially smoking in the public place can be considered as a murdering. There is a lot of disease which can be caused by smoking. Neither smoking directly nor indirectly is not good for healthy. One of the public places which must be smoking banned is restaurant.

"College student should have a part - time job. I agree with this topic because the part-time job can make the person to be a responsible person and practice to be a social person.

First, Part-time job is like a short-time job to do and it can choose the starting and finishing time, it is convenient to the student who finished their school late. Second, this job can get a few money so, some student want to do the job because they want to help their parents about a learning payment.

"Part time jobs for college students are a great idea and can really help them earn some money for; educational fees, daily living expenses and also give them some very useful on the job training experience. Some of the easier jobs for inexperienced students to land include, dish washing, waiting on tables, car wash, packing store shelves as a night clerk or if they are really lucky, working in the same industry or profession that they are going to work in when they graduate. I admit, some of the other jobs may have less appeal, but if students try to keep the big picture in mind and think outside the box, even the less than appealing jobs are great opportunities to start with. Realistically, any job experience looks better on a resume than nothing and it shows that the student was industrious, not afraid to work and was playing an active role in being financial responsible. Finally, even if the job is less than perfect, the student is still able to use this as a stepping stone toward bigger, better and maybe more lucrative opportunities. The reason is simple and I do not have all of the answers as to why, but the fact remains that it is easier to land a new job when you already have a job than it is to get a new job when you don't have a job. Statistics support this so, go figure?",C2
"College is a transitional time from dependence to independence for most people in modern society. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job, and I shall support my claim with three points. Firstly, on the domestic front, a young person generally leaves the security of the family unit at this time in his life and begins to strike out on his own. Part time work during a course-load at college will begin to encourage thoughts of pecuniary insight and financial responsibility. Secondly, a college student needs to be able to afford school supplies, and to be able to support his changing interests, be they hobbies, extra-curricular activities, or simply entertainment. Finally, as he begins to assert his independence, a college student will likely begin to explore thoughts of starting his own family. Whether or not he will actually go so far as to do so of course will vary from person to person. However, dating, courting and generally meeting viable people with whom to explore these possibilities will likely manifest themselves during this transitional time. Independent means of supporting these activities is essential in order to become a responsible, contributing member of society. For the reasons stated above, I believe that a college student needs the experience of part-time work.",C2
"There are several way to destroy your health. People always do it even if they know how bad it is. For example drinking alcohol eating disorder going bed late and last but not least smoking. In Thailand, we can see people smoke in public place like on the bus, in the park, or even restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant is not allowed in some restaurant. In some restaurant, they have the forbid tag of smoking on the door. Everyone know well about smelling the smoke. It is not destroy smoker but it also destroy the people who is sitting nearby. In Thailand, we should ban the people who smoke in public place by go way from them and leave them alone. This way will make them have no friend. The important problem of smoking in public place is smoking in the restaurant. In spite of having forbid tag in front of the restaurant they still do it. The restaurant owner should fine them or maybe the owner should charge two time of the price of food that they have ordered or service them unpressured.

In this essay, I will be specifically using National University of Singapore (NUS) as the main college of study. Firstly, it is imperative to note that when students reach university level, they are treated as being responsible adults and thus it would seem ironic if they are still receiving pocket money from their parents. Hence, I argue that college students, as responsible adults, should take on a part-time job in order to finance their personal spending. In addition, when college students take on part-time job, they learn how to manage their time more effectively and that these part-time jobs allow them to learn certain skills that might be helpful for them in their future job search. In particular, work culture and school culture differs to a large extent, whereby in schools, students are age-segregated and students learn to work with people of similar backgrounds and age. In contrast, students are expected to mingle with people of diverse backgrounds and age in the workplace, hence this highlights another important positive element of having college students to take on part-time jobs. In conclusion, I have argued that it is important for college students to have a part-time job due to two main reasons, in order to finance their personal spending with their own efforts and also enhancing themselves with respect to certain skill-sets.

"Smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants across the country. There is not a single benefit from the habit that justifies the continuation of an act which endangers not just the smoker's health but also the people physically in close proximity. Smoking has been a social habit since the 18th century, and has undergone several evolutions before being marketed globally and becoming a lucrative business. Smoking is the number one cause for the high rates of lung cancers and other smoke related diseases. Nothing strange about that, if one looks closely at the components of a cigarette. Nicotine, tartar and other harmful chemicals are all packed into this little package which promises a momentary physical ""paradise"" for its users, and require frequent use if users want to relive this comfortable state. Most people are addicted to it not purely by choice, but by a physical addiction, which is triggered by psychological responses to the withdrawal symptoms if one attempts to quit smoking. People around smokers get what we call ""second hand smoke"", which researchers say are at least as dangerous as the ""first hand smoke"" smokers get. Thus, we can see the extended damage that smoking can cause. Smoking is a common tool of social bonding between smokers, which is not to be neglected since smokers form a considerable part of society. Given its large industry, tobacco and cigarette manufacturers are formidable establishments which can be detrimental to economies if they are to be closed down. These are the significant reasons why smoking still exists. We have seen why smoking still persists, even if obvious reasons justify their elimination. Still, advocates against smoking are commonly supported, and smoking is continually being eradicated across the world. Other than restaurants, other places are starting to ban smoking entirely, and this is a good first move towards a cleaner world for all. ",B1
"Air pollution issue is becoming popular in the media. This kind of pollution has a very broad area that includes smoke from cigarettes, smog from motorized transportation, smog from factories, and even waste of burning garbage. One solution which has been applied in several developed country regarding the smoke from cigarette is not to let people smoking at all restaurants all over the country. This law may seem to deny the freedom of human rights if people have a narrow point of view. People who disagree with this law must think too much about themselves that they can not see other's rights. It is true that the decision to smoke or not is up to the individual himself, but I doubt that those who decide to smoke realise that their decision has annoyed other's health. People who smoke generally have already known about the risk of smoking and they take it as a consequence once they do it. They do have a choice whether they take that risk or not, but what about others? Do they have a choice to inhale the smoke which produced by those who smoke? When this law enforced fully in all over the country, the healthy people may stay healthy. They may have their right to choose.",B1
"n my opinion, yes it should be banned in the restaurants because no one wants to smell the cigar smoke while eating, I 'm a smoker myself but I see to it that whenever I 'm in a public place like the restaurants I avoid smoking, because not all people are smokers and not all people like the sight and the smell of people smoking near them specially while eating and also I 'm a strong believer that second-hand smoking is far more dangerous than smoking it by yourself because at least when you are smoking there is a filter that can lessen the toxins that enter your body but if you're a second hand smoker then you don't have any filter that can block the toxins that you smell in the cigars. I may have my right and I do have the right to smoke if I want to, but my right ends when the right of others begin, so I 'm really into the banning of smokers in the restaurants, maybe then restaurant manager can designate a smoking area for the smokers a little too far from the people who are not smoking. It will be a great idea if all the restaurants will have a special-place for the smokers.",B1
"Nowadays, our society is full of many college students, however, most of them do not understand the works which they really want or they are really suitable. So I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Partly because by taking a part-time job can make college students know more about the related works, and partly because they can learn more knowledge in different areas, and partly because they can experience many different lives. Maybe college students will meet some difficult or some trap, but these things can be something help you in the future. But we also should notice some things, for example, we should be careful when taking a part-time job, we have to take care of ourselves, and most important is that we must not give up our majority. We have to put our schoolwork on the top one, that is, we should pass all of the subjects safely at least, but not failed. After all, being a college student is what you need to do now, so I think that if college students want to take a part-time job, they should also take much time to do their schoolwork.",B1
"Hey do you think smoking is cool? Well if you do then you will regret it later because not only will you possibly die but along with that you won t be very pretty. Now today a lot of girls and boys in their teens smoke now you may think so what but 5, 000 are under 18 and that means they could be 12 or going to the extreme 9. Now you don t have to have a cigarette in your hand to be smoking, if your parents smoke you get second hand smoke which is technically the same thing because you are still inhaling smoke actually even more. So now that you know a little of how smoking then here is a lot more. What I meant by if you start smoking then you won t be very pretty is not if you smoke for one day it s if you smoke for 10 to 36 years. Do you think that Julie Andrews got her wrinkles for smoking? NO SHE DIDN'T!!!!!! Her wrinkles came from age and wrinkles from smoking are a big difference. Because wrinkles from age are well from age, but wrinkles from smoking are because the tobacco settles in your sink. Think of it this way your thirty and you wrinkles ALL over that would be because you smoke. Or maybe your 65 or 75 then your wrinkles are ok.",B1
"I think that smoking is hazardous to the health of people who smoke and those around because smoking contains a lot of toxic to the cancer cause. In restaurants that people regarded as a public service generally used to relax and eat food that we want the taste of good food and good atmosphere. I was the one who hate the tobacco and all about smoking. When I saw anyone who is going to smoking, I will go outside that place or go out. I think they should go smoke in the smoke that the restaurant provided or should not smoke because it is not time to smoke when you go to the restaurant. They should think it is time for eating, they should have fun for eating and enjoy the taste. Why they have to smoke in the restaurants, that doesn't make any sense for me at all. To smoke outside will not disturb the people around you so it might be good for other people. They should honor and respect the privacy of others. I agree with them so that prohibited smoking at restaurant because at least we can place free from tobacco smoke causes cancer and the environment around us is not good to have delicious food. Free from toxic environments.",A2
"I disagree that having a part time job is important to a college student. The average Singaporean college student would be bombarded with huge amount of work. Where in the world would a student find the time to take up a part time job? It requires a lot of time and effort for such a commitment. A college student without much skill would be left to do manual labour and paid low wages. Time is very precious to a college student (in contrast to a secondary school student), and the amount of time and effort is simply not worth a few bucks per hour. However, should the student have spare time on his or her hands, it would be good to get a part time job. Having a part time job allows the student to get a taste of the working world and it could be useful in the future when applying for a job. Also, additional income wouldn't hurt anyone. A part time job would be more suitable if it's during the school vacation. Having a job during school term might cause burn out. The student might go to class feeling tired or a lower concentration, affecting his/her studies. It's more important to focus on studies so that we are able to carve our own careers in the future.

"I agree that college students have a part time job. There are some reasons. First, students who have a part time job can help support a family. These days the college tuition fees and food expenses are growing. Parents' worries and sigh are also growing. If students have a part time job and earn their pocket money, they could aid family finances. Next, It can help increase experiences and careers to work part time job. Most people get a job after they graduated from the school. If we have a experience about part time job, when we get a job we can easily adapt ourselves to place of work. Finally, we can know the value of money. Give an example. I receive allowance from my parents. Because they give me pocket money on a weekly basis, I don't feel well the shortage of money. So I tend to spend all money if money exists. Therefore, college students who get a allowance lavish their money on everything since they don't make money. But, college students who have a part time job know the value of money and use money frugally. Like this there are many adventages of part time job. Although side effects of it exist, I hope that students wii be independent through working a part time job.",B2
"I agree with this idea. The reason as ground for my opinion is that considering all benefits of smoke, smoking in restaurants isn't good but only harmful for people who don't smoke. For people who smoke, smoking in restaurants and cafeterias may give them relaxing and good feelings. It may be natural that when they eat lunch and want to take a rest, they think they want to smoke. And because cigarettes include addictive drugs (nicotine and so), many smoker cannot live without cigarettes. But, we must check that basically, smoking injure with not only smokers themselves but also people who don't smoke. When one person smokes, people around him who don't smoke are likely to absorb more harmful cigarette smoke. Besides, restaurants are places where people eat lunch and supper. Smoking in such places indicates that one person makes people around him eat cigarette smoke. I can't imagine how much eating cigarette smoke does harm with people. And, if ever people of restaurants divide smoke area with no-smoke area, cigarette smoke float. So anyway, no-smokers will be injured. As far as this fact exists, Smokers must not consider their enjoyment and pleasure but the existence of no-smokers. Restaurants are places where everyone utilizes, so to speak, public spaces. Smokers who use them don't have to think only themselves. So I agree with this idea.",B1
"Drugs addiction is very dangerous habit. It is enough to destroy a nation. In Pakistan this disease has been growing dangerously. It is very alarming situation. The habit of smoking is the most common one. Smokers can be seen everywhere in our country. But there presence in restaurant is very irritating. They disperse the environment of a restaurant. Restaurant is for everyone for families, friends and relatives not only for smokers. When everyone is eating, feasting, and enjoying. The smokers make the environment very unpleasant. A smokers is enemy of his own life and by doing smoking he destroy the lives of other people also. Smoking affects the smoker's lungs and breathing. Mostly intensive smoking result death of the smokers. But smoking is dangerous not only for smokers but also for other. The smoke of smoking is very dangerous for others. When a smokers smoke of smoking, the smoke of smoking is inhaled by others. This inhaled smoke gets into lungs and creates disturbance in the inhaling process. It causes different disease like asthma, black cough, cancer and other diseases. All these diseases in their acute from ends at death of the smoking usually full in the disease of cancer. That's why the other people who don't smoke are much affected than the smokers. So it's necessary to ban the smoking in restaurant. In the restaurant the great strength is of women. And the smoke of smoking is most dangerous for women. It affects women's reproductive system badly. In Weston countries the disease of women reproductive system is very much common due to smoking and also due to inhalation of smoke. The smoke of cigarette is poison for the pregnant women because it dangerous the life of her baby. So, it is necessary to ban the smoking at restaurant.",B1
 It is an important for college students to have part time jobs. Students are an important part of any nation or society. Because they are nation builders. They have to work for their country or people in their future or practical life. So it is very important or beneficial for the students to do a part time job. With this activity they can learn better and know about the other world and its ups and downs. With the part time job a student can bear his or her financial burden. He or she can also support his or her family or parents who are responsible to stand the student strongly on his own feets. Part time job has also many benefits like it keep the students away from the bad people and bad activates by engaging there mind in the spare time. They can make use full their leisure time and also get money for their daily spending. So we can say that by the part time job a students can learn more better or efficient practically and can stronger his or her household or family. Also they can work for the goodness of their country and nation and make it rich.,B1
"Restaurants in Hong Kong have been divided into two zones---non-smoking area and smoking area for the sake of public's health. However, only if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, can the aim be achieved. Nowadays the air quality in restaurants is not as clean as we think. Smoking always produces harmful particles, like sulphur, nicotine, tar, etc. Nonetheless, they are invisible to human. The harmful particles produced are trapped in restaurants and flow from smoking area to non-smoking area. The air we breathe in is actually contains many impurities. Prolong staying in a restaurant which has a smoking area do harm to people, especially the workers here. Moreover, there are many people go to restaurants, ranging from infants to elderly. The harmful particles can easily damage their health. Some people may argue that completely banning of smoking in restaurants demolish smokers' human right. In a society, we should make a comprehensive consideration before making any decisions---balance between individuals' interests and the whole society's. All decisions we made should base on most citizens' interests. Banning of smoking is proposed to be applied in restaurants only. The government or some social communities have set up some smoking zones for smokers which show their care to smokers. If you were a smoke, would you smoke in a living room and let your family take in second-hand smoke? To most parents, they would like to go to toilet and take cigarette alone. It is the same situation. Please be more considerate. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the healthy development of the society.",B1
"Nowadays, many college students have a part-time job. There are various part-time jobs. For example, Convenient store, bar, restaurant, gas station, department store and so on. Many students go to work part-time after school. We need to see whether these part-time jobs have a good effect on college students. There is no reason to oppose working a part-time job. I suggest college students should have put motive of part-time job not earning money but getting hands-on experience. Part-time job is paid hourly. So it is difficult for students to make a lot of money. Time can be spending easily. It isn't desirable for students to earn much money, because they have to do much work. Younger days Time is also very important. I agree that hand-on experience is more effective than lecture-based learning. On account of part-time job, many college students can learn the society and be a wise man. Thanks to part-time job, many college students can learn socialization. They actually do a part-time job and earn money. This process makes the students find a real society. Earning money do college students good. Because earning money is difficult, student save money. Owing to diver's experience, students can learn to be sociable. Part-time job help people realize labor relation, the ways of the world. But, it is desirable to keep out of the way when students study major. I am of the opinion that Students should not forget duty as a student. Simple real experience made our live stimulate and have a good impact on ours. But above all, Study is more important than part-time job. Personally, I think that part-time job is useful in regard to sociality and various hands-on experiences. What it comes down to that it is important that part-time job should fit in study.",B1
"When students reach the tertiary level of their education, most people, especially the older generation, would expect them to be independent and more mature. It is often recognized as the time where the person finds his/her own self and takes responsibility for whatever step he/she takes in his/her journey in finding his/her own identity. Having a job at this early time somehow helps the students in their path to self-knowledge. Earning money through their own tears and hardship will open their eyes to their future life after school; the real life, as what they say. It helps them manage themselves properly and find their strengths and at the same time, their weaknesses. Having a job doesn't only mean that they gain profit, but rather, it also helps them gain knowledge. Also, it is a big help to their family who have supported their education for at least the past nine years of their life. It would be their way of uplifting the burden on the shoulders of the people who've helped them reach where they are now. It's good to know that even at this early time of their life, they are already taking responsibility of their actions. But still, they should still know to prioritize their studies even if they already have a job.",B1
"I'm in college and having to accept part-time job. Because there are people who like having a part-time job. The house is poor and circumstances Whose going private is not involved? But do not take pride in a job This is a problem. Prefer part-time students must have their pride as professionals. Otherwise, the view is not a good look. But there are problems. If things could be less studied. If you do not mind this issue is a part-time job But by hiring two people part-time, let the two people in the economic help. I should think positively about part-time job. Both work and personal life because it can. I hope it is not bad I think the transition should be. Tuition comes a lot of talk recently on the news. Tuition is expensive. So people are hard to. So, students must earn money, part-time job. Should help in some way. Tuition should go down Attends a school not too expensive There is a lot of fighting going on. Lower tuition to that fact is not. Should pick up visions of them dividends. It is a bad idea.

"I agree with the point that it is very important that college students have part-time jobs. I have some reasons. Setting foot in college also means entering the society. High school students have a great desire to know what does the adult world really like. There is no doubt that taking part-time job is their choice. Not only experts but parents suggest our freshmen or higher class college students to have experience of part-time jobs. My father told me that part-time job is a challenge; and I will be confronted with difficulties. Whether the difficulties the part-time job is, which is not significant to concern. We only try, devote emotion and to be hardworking is enough. Thus the more effort we make, the more we will gain. The essential thing is that we can learn how to manage a work and succeed. Furthermore, taking part-time job is paid. Money always is a motion for working. Do you think it is attractive?Generally speaking, taking a part-time job brings college students an advanced impression about the future working life. That precious experience will a cause a great influence and it is beneficial. So if you have time, don't wait and try to find a part-time job.",A2
"Restaurants are the places where we enjoy dishes' pleasant smell, good flavor, conversation with friend and so on. When someone begin smoking in the restaurant, people surrounded him must be hurt their feelings because the smoke makes the dishes' tastes and the atmosphere in the restaurant bad. So the restaurant's customers are not satisfied in dishes. This might be responsible for the restaurant's unpopularity. In terms of health, the effect of passive smoking on human is grater the that of inhaling smoking. In other words, passive smokers are apt to be taken ills including cancer of the lungs. If someone begin smoking in public space, he do damage to people who surrounded him. Namely, smokers who smoke in a crowded space, they reduce the length of other people's life. How guilty it is! Smokers must be considered the place for smoking wherever they are. Recently, there are many restaurants that make smoking sections. But nonsmokers often sit down and eat in the smoking sections if nonsmoking sections' seat is filled. So if smokers want to smoke, they should be outside the restaurant, or the master of the restaurant is ought to provide the smoking area for only smokers. If so, nonsmokers cannot smoke passively.",A2
"What smoking? Smoking is cigarette-burning actives. As a material with a strong addictive cigarette smokers tend to smoke if you continue to occur. Smokers are addicted to the nicotine contained in cigarettes. Absorption of nicotine addiction on a regular basis, if shake and emotional withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety comes. Coming very soon, these withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours of smoking could resist smoking again. Thus, if an addict, Classified as nicotine addiction will be treated as a psychiatric disorder. If a large amount of nicotine absorbed, Nervous, Digestive, Circulatory, Endocrine, as well as to the affects vision. In recent years, smokers, women and young people are going rises exponentially.

Smoking lowered the chances of pregnant women giving birth of if the developmental disabilities of the fetus were born, distraction, emotional instability appears. In the case of passive smiling directly gives more damage than smoking. Smoking directly into the filter at least carcinogens is filtered. But, secondhand smoke in the filter as unfiltered smoke, the risk of lung cancer because it absorbs more than twice that smoking is directly. As a result, smoking will damage to every person.",B1
"I disagree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Certainly many people who don't smoke don't want to eat in the next of smoking people. I agree with this thinking. But by banning smoking at a restaurant smoking people don't stop by it to eat and drink. It makes two bad things. In the first when smoking is banned at all the restaurants, smoking people can not eat out. Then they can't eat something in their favorite restaurants. It makes them unhappy. And when smoking people don't eat in restaurants, the number of guest who comes to restaurants is less than ever. Then the profit of the restaurant decreased. I think that it is very inconvenient for the restaurant. So I disagree with that smoking should be completely banned. But we should consider of people who don't smoke. Therefore I think that smoking should be in part banned at all the restaurants. Restaurants have the part of space where people can smoke and the part of space where people can not smoke. By doing that both of non-smoking people and smoking people can enjoy theirs dishes. So I disagree with that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country but I agree with that it should be in part banned.",B1
"Smoking is dangerous habit which is taken as a Fashion in the Modern age. Smoking is harmful habit which is spread in all over the world. Smoking is made the cause of many dangerous diseases like Cancer, T. B and mouth's cancer.

The people are free in his will and they do everything freely without any restriction. Landlord and other business men like smoking for their pleasant mood. They also used cigarette to show their status. Smoking is became a Fashion in Pakistan. New generation is also attractive to it. In bars it drives down business.

"We can see people with a cigarette at every corner of the world, and many governments have taken measures to deal with the problem. There are several reasons to do so. At first, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and health of people surrounds us. Some experts say that second-hand smoking is more harmful than smoking. So people smoke will do harm to non-smokers in the restaurants. It is unfair for non-smokers. So it is reasonable to ban the smoking in public places. In addition smoking shows a person's attitude. If a person smokes in the restaurant; it means he doesn't respect other people's feeling. Many non-smokers feel very uncomfortable when they smell the smoke in the restaurants. What is more, when someone is smoking around a pregnant woman, it can be very dangerous for the baby. Although many smokers say that banning smoking in the restaurants is a influence towards human's freedom and privacy, in fact, facing the death which is caused by smoking or second-hand smoking, the freedom and privacy mean nothing at all. But people do have the right to choose whether they want to have this kind of lifestyle or not. So it is really hard to ban smoking completely in all places in the country. But restaurants are public places. Thus, what we should do now is to ban smoking in the restaurants for all people's health. In a word, it is correct to ban smoking in all the restaurants because smoking is only a bad thing.",B1
"I think that college students have a part-time jab before graduating from university. Because they didn't have any experience about a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a fresh man, I worked Lotto Riau as a part time worker for one year. And my parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and got little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than I didn't have it. There is a bad aspect. It means I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought whether I stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young. So I had many chance in future and I had to go to army. Now I don't regret it. If I turn a fresh man, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be succeed than no having experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.",B2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, if students have a part-time job, they can know how they work in society. they will have to work when they graduate their colleges. So I think they should have time to prepare for working in society. Second, If they work in various situations, they will learn how they communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate their colleges. So they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become emploees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the most thing they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money. So I think they should work on summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it make their life more valuable thing.",A2
"Smoking is not good action, because smoking can cause many diseases including heart attack, disorders of pregnancy, impotence and cancer. But many people do not really bother with the dangers that cigarette. Many people become addicted to cigarettes today. Children, adolescents and parents did not escape the cigarette addicts and it is almost impossible for him to stop smoking. Especially people who have many problems or are in an environment that supports a person is smoking. Smoking is sometimes also used as a trend. Someone will be branded gentle when he smoked, or as a means of showing off that one was great. Though the dangers of smoking is very large, nicotine in cigarettes is a harmful chemical in the body. The smokers also sometimes do not give a damn on the environment, in public places they are very casually smoking a result these people will also be smokers (passive smokers), not just smoking carelessly and causing discomfort they also discard cigarette butts carelessly. to the culture of smoking should be avoided because it can interfere with the future, the environment and therefore many more losses. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.",B1
"I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job. I have three reasons to think that. First, I can ready to go out into the world. If I go into the world without having a part-time job, I'll be in trouble because I couldn't learn the manner to contact with others and the basic attitude on business. I think I can learn the important elements of working in a part-time job. Second, I can understand the significance of money and the hardness to earn money through part-time job. When I was still high school student, I took some money from my parents as pocket money and I used them without thinking specially. But after I learn the hardness to earn money, I thank for my parents. That is, I could study the value of money. Third, I can make many friends besides friends of college. If I don't I have a part-time job, when I try to make friends, it is not easy to get out of a narrow range as a college. A part-time job is a place for meeting. I can meet people of another college or much older people or much younger people. They give me chances to enlarge my experience. The above explains why I think a part-time job is important for college students. Let me finish report with this.",B1
"I don't think that have a part-time job is important to college students. First, not all of the family can't afford a college student's expense. It is a fact that though poor people are everywhere, the rich is still have a large amount. Therefore, the student whose family can give he or she a unworried life, he or she have choices. They can choose to get a part-time job to earn experience or just focus on their school. Second, have a part-time job means that you have to sacrifice your time to do other things which you may be more interesting. Because we are students, we only have time to work at night or on holiday. However, just because we are students, we are still young, we are energetic! I can still remember when I was a freshman; everything in college is fresh to me! Every night I always want to go out with my friends. I want to play; I want to discover something that I never experience before! Somehow, there are still many people that are not like me. They prefer work hard on their studies. Above are the reasons that I thought that not every college student need to have a part-time job!",B1
"Today, smoking is banned at most places. This is the reason why people became regard smoking as harmful and annoyance recently. Certainly, smoke of smoking do harm to your and other's body, and heating cigarettes cause by fire and burn, and some people throw their cigarettes on the road, river and so on. Most people hope not to smoke exclude in specific spaces. To buy cigarettes and smoking is to buy and throw about poison and to burn your money by yourself. If you smoke, your family and your friend must not feel comfortable. Similarly, people hate smoke and odor. Especially, in the restaurants, cleanness is lost and people cannot enjoy a dinner by your smoking. Nobody want to eat a dinner in place where is smoky and bad-smelling. Looks and smells of dishes are important to enjoy dinner. In the restaurants, you can enjoy not only eating but also talking with your family, friends and colleagues. The smell is not spices or sources but nicotine and the smoke make you cough and your eyes are sore and eventually you cannot concentrate on your eating and talking. Thus, you cannot have a nice time in the restaurants. Above all, smoking when you eat is bad manners. Smoking must be banned in places not only of eating but also where smoking makes a lot of people annoying.",A2
"I think that it is good for students of a university to have a part-time-job. I have three reasons for this. First, it is a good opportunity to think how to work in the future. We can learn the manner of the way of speak or act. And we can understand how important working is. These days, many students are said like this ""they don't think seriously about their future"". So, I think that trying to join a job is very important for students of a university. Second, we can meet a lot of people through a part-time-job. Actually, I have a part-time-job as a waitress of the restaurant. Through my job, I have been able to meet various people such as students of other universities, the chef, customers and so on. Meeting many people and Knowing various way of think is really precious experience for me. I think that it same for students. Third, it will lead people to recognize the importance of money. Before I started to work, I didn't care about money. But when I earn money, I really understand how important it is. It may lead students to stop to waste money. For these reasons, if a student well know the importance of studying and good at using times, it is good for him or her to have a part-time-job.",B1
"Smoking, as we all know, is harmful to our health. Thousands of lung cancer deaths were caused by smoking and breathing in secondhand smoke. As a non-smoker, I cannot agree with more for banning smoking at all restaurants. The secondhand smoke can cause many innocence persons to death. Many cases show that not only the smoker, but also the secondhand smoker will be suffered from different kinds of diseases, e. g. Lung cancer and heart disease. Therefore, the restaurants, where we go very often, should ban the smoking to avoid innocence people breathing in the harmful smoke. Smoking be banned at all restaurants can show the support of the local government for non-smoking environment and for the sake of the health of its citizen. People will be more awareness about the harm of smoking if the government ban smoking and promote non-smoking life. The most important thing is that restaurants are places for people to gathering with families and friends. How can you enjoy a dinner with the forced secondhand smoke breath? It cannot help even if the restaurant has divided its area to smoking and non-smoking area. The smoke can still be circulated at the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants to provide citizen a comfortable place for dining. Last but not least, smoking is not good for anyone. We should all support non-smoking environment and pursuit a healthy life.",B2
"Smoking in restaurants is a crime against humanity. It is a travesty, a blemish on the fabric of human society, a glitch in the Matrix. It is an enemy of the human race; like Moby Dick to Ahab, like Voldemort to Harry Potter, like Twilight to literature. It is the reason cavemen killed each other, the reason weapons were invented, the reason Hitler waged war. Convincing me that smoking in restaurants is acceptable on any level at all is like convincing a blind man to buy a 3D HDTV; it simply does not compute. I am not talking about the health risks caused by smoking. Respiratory illnesses, lung cancer, the Black Plague for all I care. It is your lungs breathing the smoke, your money paying for it, and your brain deciding that this somehow makes sense. You, however, are not going to smoke within any reasonable radius of the untainted pink lungs that belong to me. A restaurant is a public place. A smoker loses the right to do what he pleases when his actions infringe upon others and their ability to do what they please. Banning smoking is not a way of infringing on your rights, it is a way of making sure you do not infringe on mine. Forget all that; this is eating we are speaking of! Food is a beautiful mix of sights and smells, a confluence of aromatic explosions. Dining is an experience, and the culinary arts are the pinnacle of human achievement. A good meal is the work of an artist. Any chef worth his weight in salt (or soy sauce, since we are in Hong Kong) will shriek in horror if it is known that the splendid scent of tobacco is going to infuse itself into his work of art. So for the sake of human decency, could we please put the damned cigarette down and enjoy our meal?",B2
"I think that it is great for college students to work part-time. First of all, in my case, I live by myself. So my mother supports money to live. But when I go shopping and go out somewhere with my friends, I shouldn't use money which my mother gave me. I think that it is bad to be supported too much money and to depend on our parents very much. So, it is good for us to work part-time to be independent of our parents. Next, we can learn the importance to earn money and the hardship to work by working part-time. If we experience it during college days, we can consider our job in the future very well. Third, we can make friends with through part-time job. We can do it in the college too. In this case, however, we can't make friends with other college students and people who are older than us. On the other hand, we can do it through part-time job. I don't still work part-time, but I want to start it soon. If I start it, I want to be independent of my mother little by little and make friends with many people. So I think that it is great for college students to work part-time.",B1
"In modern life, more and more people are addicted in smoking. In china, smoking has been banned only in some limited public places. So, if you walk on the road or other public place, you will see many people smoking. But in fact, it is not healthy for people, especially the second-hand smoking. The second-hand smoking is the smoke that is breathed out by the smoking man. It is more harmful for people. It will increase the possibilities of having cancer or other disease in lung. In addition to the harmful aspect, smoking in public also expresses a bad image on others. Maybe someone thinks that it is cool to smoke. They look on smoking as a good way to show themselves. However, it is just a misunderstanding. Smoking will not brighten your image. On the contrary, it will bring you many negative influences. Finally, smoking does much harm to the environment. It will pollute the air. When we breathe the unclear air, we may well be ill. Smoking at a restaurant is harmful in particular. In a word, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As the less smoking we take, the healthier we will be.",B1
"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because the experience to work and to get money with themselves may make the college students growing up. Angering their boss and missing their job may give them rich spirit. After they become the member of society, they will enjoy and leave wonderful achievement. If they don't have a part-time job when they are the college students, some of them will be worthless people. They don't know the society. They don't know that it's importance to get money with working. Of course, some of the college students who don't work know that important view. But, many of the college students may not know. I think. Other reason of the importance of a part-time job is simply. College students need much money. Whether they stay home with their family or not, they may want to enjoy the college life. It may be the play, study and love. Anyway, they need much money. So they must have a part-time job. Finally, I think, it is not only the college students but also society to want the college student to have a part-time job. The college students are the element of society, too. If none of them worked, society might not exist.",A2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking. First, my family and I don't smoke, so I smell the little flavor of cigarettes. And I don't like it very much. I think many people also don't like it. Moreover, because of the smell of cigarettes, we can't taste the meal at a restaurant and we can't eat delicious meal. So it is important to ban smoking at all restaurants. Secondly, there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at some restaurants. When nonsmoking seats are full and I don't want to wait, I may go to smoking seats. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, I may sit soon at nonsmoking seats. Finally, I think that if the place where we can smoke decrease, people who stop smoking increase. And we can live more comfortable than today. For example, we may not smell the flavor of cigarettes at a station or in the city. In addition to that, illnesses such as lung cancer decrease. Man say cigarettes do harm for health. Smoking has a bad effect not only on smoker but also on non-smoker.",A2
"I agree this subject. I think that it is important to have a part time job for college student. Because colleges are not only the place where we study but also the place where we grow to be adult. It is important to communicate many people for adult. However, colleges are closed. Because we spend many times with limited people. For example, teachers and a part of friends. Other hand, a person who has a part time job meet many people every day. In society, it happens many times that it is acquired communication ability than working ability. For example, the person who belongs a company must communicate his costomar and collegue every day. If he did not communicate them, he would be regarded as a bad employee. If he has a good ability for his job, this case will happen. So, less communication ability might be a handicapped for working. We students should take a communication many other people at young time. It is clearly that college students must study. But college students are not persons who only write a sentence and calcurate a question. College students should has identity and ability to survive in society. A part time job helps college students to have them.",B1
"In my opinion, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I think that restaurants which many children use should completely ban smoking. That is because smoking may have bad effects on them. Smoking is bad to health and may be the reason to cause cancers. People whose ages are under 20 must not smoke. But they may want to smoke when they see people smoking in the restaurants. Today more and more people stop smoking. So smoking should be banned in the restaurants for them to be comfortable. But, there also many people who always want to smoke. If all the restaurants ban smoking, they will be angry and not be comfortable. So in my opinion, there should be the restaurants which people can freely smoke, and only adults can use the restaurants. There should be the restaurants of two types. One type completely bans smoking and the other type completely permits smoking. Today, the view of smoking is changing. According to the newspaper, the number of smokers is decreasing. So I think some changes are needed in the restaurants. It is best that all people who are both smokers and not smokers are comfortable. I believe that my opinion will make it possible.",B1
"As a college student, we have a lot of choices to fill our free time. Some students just study in the library, some join clubs which they are interested in. Also, there are a number of students who choose to get a part-time job after class. According to some graduates' experience, having a part-time job is really important. Firstly, we have a lot of free time in our college life, and we all know that we have no excuse to waste it. As a result of it, besides study and clubs, getting a part-time may be a wise choice. Secondly, we can get some money from the part-time job, although it is not much, it can help to afford our cost of living in the campus. Thirdly, a part-time job is beneficial for us to improve our ability of communication and increase our working experience. It is universally known that they will be very useful when we graduate and need to find a stable job in the future. Finally, when we are working for the part-time job, it gives us a very good chance to build friendship. We will earn some unforgettable memories from the job. Even though a part-time job cannot give us a lot, it is still important for us to have it.",B1

Smokers in smoke, but I think non-Smokers is position the smell is to let you know that it is suffering. Smoking is Free, but if the damage is, I think it's not free. It against smoking in the restaurant thinks its okay. In essence, the first time that secondhand smoke is formed and the elapsed time and distance Traveled by the nature and concentration is a mixture of dynamic change.

"In my opinion, overtime work will may have no the importance? necessary for a student who has wealthy position, do not lack about of money, but, it is will significant, and very necessary for a student who have poor position, First of all, overtime work regards the thing that is lawful, and the work that everybody can do besides the school hours, be taking time free to the advantage, and the important factor most of overtime work, be, overtime work can help to lighten the load in about of expenses that connects with the education has of a student by oneself, For example, The parents of a student cannot make money in on schedule time, while a student has to use money, for the education, then, It may make a student loses opportunity that good education way, because, have no money, but, if, a student works the overtime, a student has will the saving deposit, and a student can spend this money comes to be way education expenses, moreover, still can help a father and mother economize expenses well, besides, I think, overtime work, be learning will have to live go together accompany experience life new accumulation that from the work, give can live stay get with oneself.

"As a number of employers from companies point out, hardly do college graduates know how to work efficiently, simply because what they learn from universities cannot be applied to their career. So as far as I'm concerned, it is of great importance for college students to have a part-time job. First and foremost, every college student will start a career in a foreseeable future, thus taking an early step in the job fields can help them adjust to a reserve life that is totally different from school days. For instance, we'll see our supervisors work and get to know how they handle their projects and how they deal with people, and that's what we are never supposed to grasp from lectures or seminars in colleges. Those working experiences can benefit college students when they start their own careers. Also, part-time jobs enrich college students' lives during their spare time. College students tend to have fewer classes and more free time than high school students. However, it has been a common phenomenon that the precious free time is wasted on chatting or playing meaningless video games. What a pity! So why don't we make full use of this golden opportunity and applying for a part-time job? That won't bore us at least, and we can have a sense of achievement via serving other people. Finally, part-time jobs can offer college students with a sum of salary, which can be attractive to those who still depend on parents economically. Technically, college students are all adults, whose parents no longer bear the responsibility to support them with pocket money. So they should earn money by themselves, pay for their tuitions and the cost of living, and most importantly to ease the burden of their parents. In conclusion, as stated above, part-time jobs provide college students with working experience and money in need. Considering all these advantages, isn't it a wise idea for college students to have a part-time job?",B1
"Recently, an issue of smoking prohibition in public area has been debated as a hot topic. In my opinion, smoking in public area especially when it is restaurant, should be prohibited because of the following two reasons. First of all, smoking is bad not only for smoker's health, but also for non-smoker's health. There are many research studies that have been conducted regarding to the relationship between smoking and health problem like lung cancer or larynx-linked disease. For example, nicotine or tar which is one of the most harmful ingredients included in tobacco, is well known to cause a serious cancer or disease to the non-smokers who inhale those things through secondary smoking as well as the smoker himself. Non-smokers have right to decide whether or not keep themselves from exposing towards the smokers. Secondly, smoking in all the restaurants should be banned because there also are many children among the people who visit the restaurants. It is pretty well known that children, unlike adults, are more likely to be affected by the secondary smoking. In case of family restaurants, problems are more serious than the normal restaurants. They should be not exposed to an unwanted smoking which can harm their health in a disastrous way. In conclusion, smoking in all public area, including restaurants should be prohibited for the other non-smokers. We should not disregard the non-smokers' rights to maintain their lives and surroundings as clean and fresh as possible. Banning all the smoking in all the restaurants should be executed immediately.",B2
"I disagree with the statement. As students, our main priority should be on studying. Taking up a part-time job could adversely affect our school work. A part-time job would mean lesser time to study. Not forgetting that students would also have lesser time to sleep, having a part-time job would also weaken the cognitive ability of the brain, further affecting our concentration in school and hence possibly taking a toll on our results. In addition, our bodies would be strained with the additional workload. School on its own is already a large burden, committing to a part-time job would further add to this burden with regards to lesser sleeping time and recreational time. Despite my argument against college students having a part-time job, I feel that there are some exceptions. For instance, there are clearly students among us who find their course-load easy to cope with and are looking for more challenges out of school to test their practical understanding of their classroom knowledge. In such a case and provided that the job in question would have some practical usage for the student's future career path, I would agree that the student should go for the job. Of course, the student should ensure that his/her school work would be in no way affected by this additional commitment. ",B1
"I think smoking in public places such as indoors of a restaurant shoudn't be allowed. There's a few good reasons for me saying that. It has been proved that smoking kills you. Besides, would you like someone smoking next to you if you have your baby with you? Not only that, But I don't think I would like anyone to be smelling the nasty smoke odors while they're eating. I also think that it shoudn't be allowed because since it's indoors all the smoke gets caught inside and it can get sort of hard to even breathe. Choosing to smoke or not to smoke is a right that every human has. Those who choose to smoke should respect non-smokers while in enclosed areas. Many public buildings have a smoke free policy. Some restaurants also have a smoke free policy, but the majority do not. Having a smoke free policy in all restaurants creates numerous positive rewards. Banning smoking in restaurants will benefit the smoker, the business, and the non-smoker. Certain chemicals become more dangerous in small buildings. Smoking outside compared to smoking in a restaurant differs enormously. Outdoors, smoke spreads throughout a greater area. In restaurants however, smoke spreads throughout a small area. It can help not just the restaurant it self but also the society.",B1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, college students having part-time jobs is more and more widespread, neither of me. As the reason of mine--I want to reduce the economy burden of their parents. On the other hand, many of college students who have a part-time job go to work because they want to have more pocket money. No matter what reason for university students to have a part-time job, as long as the reason and the part-time job which they choose to do are good and security, I think that it is good for college students to have a part-time job. At the same time, students can learn many things which school teachers will not teach in the class. Students, who have a part-time job, enter the society earlier than those who haven't. While working part-time, students experience how the society functions and learn to deal with issues maturely. Having a part-time job could give the students a hands-on experience to test their skills, and see whether they are interested in the job. As well, students working at an early age encounter the hardship of earning a living themselves; therefore, they treasure and view money differently. Students with a job could also help out their family finance. However, as the proverb goes"" You cannot burn the candle at both ends. "" Students also should pay attentions to their academic employees. After all, student's responsibilities are studying actually.",B1
"I totally agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country, because it is not only concerning smokers, but also concerning other people around them. Even this rule would be not convenient for those who smoke. There are three reasons why I support this rule. First, smoking would cover fragrance of food and people could only smell smoke, not their food. That could interfere with people enjoying their meal. Second, smoking would be dangerous for other people. At the restaurant, especially at buffet, there would be a lot of people, such as waiters or waitresses and other people who want to go to the restroom or leave, walking around. If smokers are not careful, fired cigarettes would make them hurt. Third, the second-hand smoke is not good for health. Inhaling second-hand smoke could increase the rate of generating liver cancer. Besides, to some people who have breathed disease smoking would harden their sickness. According to these three reasons, therefore, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nevertheless, the restaurants also have to establish the smoking room for the people who want to smoke. No matters smoking or not, everyone all could enjoy their time at restaurant.",B1

"The college students should not only study but also work a part time job in the same time. Because the students do a part time job will get a lot of experiences from working. When the students work in the real job they can use the knowledge to the work. They can get some good advice from the boss and friends working in the same place. If they do some wrong work, they can ask the boss how to work properly. They receive the money and they can use these money to buy the thing whatever they want like the cosmetics, fashion bag, shoes, dresses, and mobile phone. College students who don't have money have to find part time job. They will know how hard when they parents work for the money to support them. They will not use the money to buy a very expensive thing. The government should help the college students to find the good job and protect them from selfish boss. The teacher should suggest a good and safe place for students to work. If students have problem they can talk with teacher and parents.",B1
"Smoking is very bad for health. In America and many other countries, many people are getting sick or have died for smoking diseases. It is because nicotine, which is included in a cigarette, causes lung cancer. When people smoke, they get nicotine with their breath and it collects at their lung. After many years go through, nicotine which costed for many years causes lung cancer. Thus, smoking is very bad for health. In addition to it, smoking is very dangerous not only for smoking people but also for non smoking people. If people smoke, smokes which contain nicotine are produced and are widespread in the air. And by breathing it, people around the smoker get nicotine. Some people say that since the smoke which is widespread in the air contains more nicotine than the nicotine smoker directly gets, people around the smokers may have higher risks to get a lung cancer than smokers themselves have. So smoking is very dangerous not only for smokers but also for non smokers and this is why I disagree with this statement. Because people have a right to smoke and not a few people want to smoke even if there are risks like a lung cancer, I don't forbid smoking. However, non smokers also have a right to lead a healthy life. So people may smoke at the private place, but they shouldn't be allowed to smoke at the public place.",B1
"Yes, smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants in the country. For Singapore's case, there have been designated areas outside of the restaurants for patrons who smoke. Whoever, I believe more can be done. By having smoking areas outside of the restaurants, other passersby may be affected by the fumes from these patrons. Thus, I believe there should be an elimination of smoking anywhere around the premises so that all patrons can enjoy fresh and clean air no matter where they seat. Some restaurants such as PS Cafe at Dempsey have designated their smoking area at the top of their building but I believe that patrons who may want to have a good view of the city may be affected by these smokers. Second hand smoke is one of the causes of cancer, which has been reiterated time and again. Thus, an absolute abolishment should deter people from picking this unhealthy habit. By not allowing restaurants to have any form of smoking will eventually give these patrons a reason to kick the habit so as to socialize with their compatriots. And so, I believe that Singapore is on the right track to banning smoking at all restaurants but more could be done. Perhaps in the new future when smoking has been eradicated, everyone will have a wonderful dining experience. ",B2
"I think it is a good idea that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants because we all know that cigarettes can cause us a liver disease, bad breath and can weaken our ability to think. A cigarette not only affects the users but also the people near with it. It's because of the smoke coming from the cigarette that is exhaled by the smoker and combines through the air and inhaled by the person nearby. The person will gain the Second hand smoke even though it is called the second its effects is greater than the smoker. It is really important to have a no smoking policies to all the restaurants so that the cleanliness in the surrounding and even in the air remains. It also maintains the good comments of the people to the restaurants because smoking in an area makes the place like it is not a formal place. The restaurants have their own rules and one of the most important rule is to serve well the customers and to know the sayings that the customers is always right. This means that in every restaurant they need to become ready in every customer they will have. For example if their customer is a smoker they have to talk with him/her in a good manner to asked permission that they don't allowed cigarettes in their restaurant, or bring him/her in a place where there are no customers that can be affected so that there will be no problem that can be occurred.",B1
"Nowadays, there are a lot of college students have a part-time job for countless reasons. Someone working to buy the clothes, shoes, or phones while someone working for purchase in daily life or university tuition fees. However, some students do not work a part-time job and they think it is not important. In my opinion, a part-time job is important for college students. One of the reasons that college students should have a part-time job is spending the free time usefully and getting the real experience. Moreover, they can also help their parents for the costs. For example, if they want to buy something they can buy by themselves. Another reason would be wanting to teach them how to be responsible. The final reason that college student should have a part-time job is making friends and learning to live in socially with other people. Of course, some students may think that a part-time job may take time away from studying, hanging out, and doing the homework. They may also think that a part-time job is tiring and boring. I would think that college students could do a part-time job after class or during the summer. In conclusion, I would think that a part-time job for college students is important because it gives them experience, it teaches them how to be responsible, it gives them extra money, and they can make friends by doing the job. Some students may think that a part-time job take away from studying but I think that they could either do a part-time job after class or in the summer.",B1
" As we all know that smoking is bad for our health. So should smoking be allowed in the public place has made a big discussion in the society. Some people consider that it may be very difficult to stop the people from smoking in the public place because there are so many people smoke and it may cause some serious problems as it can not be accept by so large number of people. But another part of people don't agree with them. There are so many people dead from smoking every year in the world and there are many unhealthy babies born according their parents' smoking. And when people smoke in the public place, it can be dangerous to our safe as many conflagrations are caused by the burning cigarette. The air will smell badly and be poisonous. I have the view that smoking in the public place shouldn't be allowed, but we must consider the people who are smoking. So we can make a smoking room for the people who smoke in the public place. It may good for health and can be accepted by everyone. The measures also can be made effectively and our society will be much more harmonious.",B1
" There are many people who like smoking, even in the public places they will take a cigarette in hand. Cigarette make them feel comfortable, but to the others around them, it is not comfortable at all. So, I think smoking in public places should be forbidden. Smoking, in my opinion, is totally unhealthy, especially in public places. It will not influence the smoker's own health, but is also bad for the people around. The researches show that, taking the second-hand smoking can damage people's health nearly equal to smoking by oneself. So it is not considerable nor responsible to smoke in public places. At the same time, the smoke coming from a burning cigarette can have bad influence on the environment. Public places belong to all the people, it is impolite and irresponsible to do damage to the public places' environment. The smoke can pollute the air. The burning cigarette can easily cause a fire. So it is better not to smoke in public places. Just think about our environment before lighting up a cigarette. So, from all above, we can see that smoking in public places is a really bad habit. If people no more smoking in public places, the environment will become better and there may be less fire happening. So, I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places.",A2
"Third Hand Smoking Have you ever heard of third hand smoking? I hear it's exactly like smoking cigarettes, only that your cigarette is invisible.

And even if you are interested with my Third Hand Smoking Theory, it won't be very amusing if you have asthma and the people seated at the table beside you is like a newly-lit bonfire with all the smoke they're making. Imagine that you're sitting with your old grandma who's allergic to dust and yes, smoke. What if you're with your nephews and nieces and apparently, smoke is also, bad for them. Smoking doesn't sound too good to you now, is it? What if you have colds and the smoke is irritating you, making your nose runny? Now that is the time you 'd take a step back, and rethink your view if smoking should really be allowed in restaurants. I guess you already see my point in this. Obviously, no, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. I really think the Philippines would be better off without it.",B1
"When I am in restaurant, I can usually smell that someone is smoking but I can't say anything at all, and many people have the same feeling as me, so many people think the government should publish a law to ban smoking in restaurant, I have a mixed idea about it. It is obvious that people smoking will influence the people around him. But we can ban completely smoking in restaurant as a people not smoking; we should consider the feeling of people smoking. First, we can build a special room in restaurant for people to smoke, the idea will meet people's need of smoking and the smoke will not influence people's dinner. Before the special room being built, people can smoke in toilet or beside the junk barrel. After the law being published, if any people smoke in the restaurant and influence the other people's eating, in restaurant, the waiter should advise them to go to the special room for smoking politely and if the smokers are rude and continue to smoke influencing other people, waiter can reveal the law to them for money. Generally speaking, the smoker can smoke in the restaurant, but they should smoke in the toilet or special room and guarantee they will not influence other people.",B1

Many restaurants have a separate place for smokers but smell and smoke still influence on other people's eating. Also, if smokers eat food in a separate place, they are directly exposed to smoke, so it is very harmful to them. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. Also, smoking is not limited problem to eating. It is bad for people. However, if restaurants accept people to smoke, the reason why smokers should stop smoking is reduced. For example, In Singapore, it is banned to smoke in any street. After making this policy, the number of smokers reduced. Like Singapore, if it is banned to smoke in public places, the number of smokers will be reduced. Therefore, to ban smoking in restaurants have effects on reducing smokers. Especially, restaurants are important place to be cleaned. A little amount of dust or ash should not be discovered in any restaurant. However, if restaurants accept smoking there, the ash will spread in the place, so this is bad for hygiene of a restaurant.",B2
" Nowadays more and more part-time jobs turn up. And the jobs have enormous attraction to college students. As a result, to take a part-time job seems to have become a fashion in college. Of course there are many people Those who support students to take part-time jobs have their accounts. For instance, they think students can put their knowledge leant in class into practice, and though this process they can know whether their comprehension to the very thing is right and obtain some new knowledge that they can't learn from class. In addition some students come from poor families need to take part-time jobs to earn money or they may have to stop their schooling, which is really a pity. Yes, there are many advantages of part-time jobs, but as the saying goes, every coin has two sides. As some people say, taking a part-job costs too much time which should be used to study. In that case, students' study would surely be influenced. That is not worth the candle. In my opinion, the advantages of taking a part-time job outweigh the disadvantages. Apart from the reasons above, I think we can improve our ability through this process and adapt to the society better.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant ? For this title. I don't need to think a lot to share my opinion, I absolutely without any doubt agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. Smoking as we know is very dangerous activity that will affect in long period time. The cigarette producers also put the bad benefits that is contained in cigarette. From that we know that smoking is a dangerous activity. Now I'll talk about smoking in the restaurant. First, not all the restaurants visitors are smokers. In the restaurant there are so many people from many ages. From adult to old age peoples. So, I think that smoking should be banned. Because the smoke from cigarettes will produces bad side effects from people that don't smoke, so they can be the victim of smoking. They can cough, hard to breath, etc. The air condition will be not fresh again and it'll disturb the air flow in the room. With all the uncomfortable things than can caused by smoking, banned smoking will be the very best way. But if it's not possible than the restaurant must create a smoking area for the smokers visitor, so they'll not disturb people who don't smoke",B1
"We usually eat outside at least one meal and we can see smoking people in that site. If you are a non-smoking person, you can eat cigarette smoke instead of the food. Recently, the article that people around smoking people are higher the risk for lung cancer than smoking people was announced. At least, if we are considerate people that think others than me, I think that we must not smoke at the public site like restaurant. Also by globalization society, there are a lot of foreigners in Korea. They have to eat Korea's food at Korea's restaurant. There are also people that don't like to smoke near them. If they who comes Korea because of love for Korea see smoking people at Korea's restaurant, they will think all of Koreans are impolite. And there are also children come with their parent. If we smoke in front of them, children weakened immune systems can be more harmful their health. And it can be impacted children's education purpose which improves Korea's future. I think you already know smoking is not good all aspect in our life. Although it is hard to quit smoking, why don't you stop smoking than to undergo hate eye?",B1
"Smoking is a popular activity among human beings, especially men. But as we all know, cigarettes contain some poison, many countries have banned smoking at public places. It's not enough, stopping smoking should not only at public places but also at restaurants in the country. Scientists have improved that cigarette has nicotine. It's a kind of poison. People who smoking for a long time may get nicotinism, if it's very serious, people will die for this. And people who always smoking also will have lung cancer. It can't be cured. The patients will suffer unimaginable pain. So, for human being's health, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. Smoking is not only bad for smoking people, but also unhealthy for the people around them. When one person is smoking, the people around him may get second-hand smokes. The second-hand smokes also contain nicotine, also harmful for human's body. And we see that, if people smoking in a restaurant, everyone in this restaurant will be harmed by them. As far as I know, smoking also pollute environment. The smokes it produces will pollute our atmosphere. So if we can ban smoking, we will save our world. I don't know why people invented smoking, but I know why people stop smoking. In a word, smoking is bad for our health and also harmful for our word. Banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country is a little step, one day we will stop smoking all over the world!",B1
"I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, I don't think that it should be completely banned. Of course, smoke has so bad effect on not only those who enjoy smoking directly but also people who receive indirectly and without their will, in short, smoking has no benefit, but there are a lot of people who are addicted to smoke, so it is too difficult to forbid to smoke suddenly and completely. My friend's husband died 61 years old because of lung cancer. He was heavy smoker. He smoked always in his house, his office, and even during diets. His doctor advised him not to smoke any more, or he would die of sick, lung cancer. In spite of this advice, he was smoking every day. Though he understood to give up smoking, he couldn't stop it. I have watched the TV about many kinds of cancers. I was very surprised to see a lung invaded owing to smoking. It was miserable and I thought that I didn't want to face to such a situation. Smoking is a kind of drag and should not be used, so, ideally, it ought to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, however it is difficult. Therefore, we may partly ban to smoke.",B1
"Nowadays, more and more college students are getting out of the school and do some part-time jobs while still doing their study. So, what's the reason? Apparently, it is, maybe not necessary, very important to do some part-time jobs. The importances are as follows:Firstly, as we all know, the college education pays more attention not to the practice but to the theory. However, part-time job is a chance for the students to use what they got at school and to change their theory into practice. Meanwhile, it can enrich their college life as well as improve their work abilities. Secondly, the students will get much experience through part-time job, such as how to get along with their boss and colleagues and how to develop the attitude to shoulder their responsibilities. The experience they get can do much help to their job finding after graduate. Finally, doing part-time jobs can help the students gain independence, especially the financial independence? Although it seems impossible, we have the desire to make our own living because we are already adults. However, we can earn some money if we do part-time jobs. Thus, we can ask for much less money from our parents, which can make us feel more independent.",B1
"Yes it is. Part time job is not only for those students who have financial problems, but also for those students that wants to have their own money for their needs or to have experience. We, as a student we need to know that our parents are working hard for us to finish our studies and we will realize that we need to study hard because working is harder than we thought. It will also help us to be responsible, be confident in our self. We can also improve our communication skill, be flexible, and how to balance our time with the help of this we so called part time job. Jobs make our lives more interesting. It will help us to train ourselves to earn money and to know that it is not an easy thing to earn money. And we should spend our money carefully. And for us to know the hard work of our parents, for us to realize that working is hard so that we should study well and do our part as a student and as a daughter/son. Many people think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help our future to become much better.",B1
"In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time and the reasons are as follows. Â First, I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. The second reason is that having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help teenagers find their ideal job more easily in the future. And the teenagers can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in their future working circumstance. Third, teenagers can also expand their interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people t o help us, they will try their best to help us.",B1
"I agree with smoking should be completely banner at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is the bad thing. But now a lot of people in the world are still do it. I think the reasons that cannot stop people to smoking are for example, in the family if the sons or daughters still saw his/her father smoking cigarette since they was young so they don't think that it was wrong, and now some of people who walk hard or maybe they would like to relax so they smoking immediately. Now smoking is just a fashion. Smoking no t only harm for smoker but also another people. Moreover smoking is cause the cancer which is the big problem now. So I think if the government has a project to banner at all the restaurants in the country it is extreamly good thing to do. Smokers don't have place to buy the cigarette so they cannot smoke. Another thing that government can do is to tell the people about disadvantages of cigarette. I think if everyone help together to banned smoking. This problem will disappear. Everythings cannot doing by oneself so if you don't know that your lover is died because smoking you must tell the person that you know to break with smoking.",B1
"In the present age, it is common for people from all walks of life to have a job. While the reason that drove them to attain a job may differ, this phenomenon is one that would stay. The issue of whether it is crucial for college students --- young persons within the age of 18 to 25 years old who are pursuing an education career in a tertiary institute --- to be employed to work for a relatively short period of time is indeed contentious. This essay shall attempt to illustrate that while working part-time benefits the student by allowing one to gain experience and become financially independent, it is not without its limitations, where is saps one's free time. It is important for college students to attain a part-time job. Through a part-time job, the student would inculcate valuable hard and soft skills. For instance, there would be enhanced communications between the student and one's employer and client that helps one improve on one's interpersonal skills. Technical skills specific to the job could also be quickly picked up by the student, equipping one with more knowledge that could create an all rounded individual. Furthermore, one would be able to become financially independent and learn to manage one's finances at a younger age. Hence, attaining a part-time job is important as it provides one with a range of skills that mere studying cannot achieve. Nonetheless, dissidents may argue that working is not important as the main focus of a college student is to study. Instead, critics may feel that working deprives one of leisure time, and in some cases, may even result in one being too busy, resulting in one's inability to concentrate on one's academics. This would be detrimental to the college student. ",B1
"I find it hard to make a generalisation on whether it's important or not for college students to have a part-time job, because this seems like something very individual and highly dependent on the individual student and their circumstances. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job to be more important for them than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond the merely academic, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisure, rather than on a job. A final hypothetical student might meanwhile be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardise their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all of them. ",B2
"I have never been a smoker and I usually don't go to restaurants where I encounter cigarette smoke, so I have to admit that I honestly have not given much thought to this idea. My parents have told me that smoking used to be pretty common in restaurants, and they also told me that it was pretty terrible. If this is true, then I would have to say that the restaurants in Japan should ban smoking, because I'm sure that there are parents just like mine who feel the same way. Also, I do have a few friends who are smokers, and they don't seem to mind that they cannot smoke in restaurants too much. All they have to do is go outside, and often it is nice to get a nice breath of fresh air while you are out there, they say. I really do hope that they will not smoke forever, and I think that banning smoking in restaurants has made at least a little bit of progress in encouraging people to quit smoking. If more countries ban smoking in restaurants, more people will be able to quit smoking, and everyone will become more healthy. I guess that this is a pretty good goal for the next few years.",C2
"From childhood to adult, I have heard many things about smoking, such as, lung disease and so on. In contemporary world, we can see many No smoking signs in public places, such as in the bus, in the hospital and so on. However, there are still many smokers or smoke addicts. They will feel uncomfortable if they don't smoke. Whether smoking should be banned at the restaurant? The question has sparked an immediate debate. Some people argue that restaurant is also a social occasion. Many businessmen tend to talking about their business when they are at the dinner. It is unavoidable for them to smoke. Beside, smoking is a personal thing, and others don't have the right to interfere with them. However, quite a lot of person advocates that smoking should be banned at the restaurant. Now that restaurant is a public, smoking should be banned. If many people smoke in the restaurant without limit, the environment in the restaurant will become worse and worse so that people will not have a good motion to enjoy the delicious food. The restaurant should keep consistent with the hospital and bus. Personally, smoking should be banned. If the practice is formed, many people will follow it. Smoking is not only bad for smokers but also bad for the restaurant environment.",A2
"Generally speaking, it's a high developed society that students all over the world are increasing their competitions every day. Therefore I suggest that college students who have a part time job is one of the ability to strengthen themselves. First, students who have a part time job can learn much more things than they've learn from college professors. Take cram school teacher as an example, they'll realized how difficult a teacher be or how many preparing works that a teacher should do. It's very hard to imagine how things have been done if we never be part of it. Second, by taking a part time job during the student life is a good way to know and enhance themselves to be a better person. They might face different situations that they never thought before in the classroom. Moreover, some of the part time jobs for students requires face to face toward thousands of customers. The more people you contact with the more you'll feel how small and special you are. Final and the most important one is that students who have a part time job can make lots of friends. Quan-si relationship is one of the most important networks for people to become richer or powerful. People you meet might become a millionaire in the next day or she might be president's daughter. Anyhow, friends can always help you whenever you need help.",B1
"Nowadays, pat time job are very important for the expanding of today's youth. They can help build of responsibility, influence proper choices; they can build relationship and they can help develop of self-confidence. Part time job there are many different reasons why taking a part time job. Really, they are both of advantage and disadvantage. In the first place development is to form of foundation for self-discipline. The student should have dependent to think how to budget in everyday life. And also this is the advantage to less of expensive also their parents. The second is communication skills are important to us especially how to handle to each people right now. And this is right time to improve how the way you talk to them. The third is social experiencing is the group of people to communicate the others and searching in the future. At last they are making their college life is colorful by having the various part time job and different people industries. The part time job disadvantages for the students between school and work the students they are affected the studies. Like for example if the students are tired how will do the assignment without rest and sometimes cannot go to school.",B1
"I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because our government should take more strict method to protect the right of the people who don't smoke. I think the smokers should respect the right of the people who don't smoke. The smoker may think smoking is a relax activity, but it is a torture to the people who don't smoke. The smell of the smoke is awful and hard to endure. The smoke will cling to our clothes. So the smoke is really a nightmare. I think another reason why the government should ban smoking at closed space is health. There are many essays showing that cigarettes are bad for our health and the statistics prove that smoke directly lead to the lung cancer. The evidence shows that the second-hand smoke is more poisonous than the smoker inhale. Though the packing of cigarettes show the slogan, it doesn't have the effect. The government also raises the price of cigarette, but the customers don't change their habit of smoke. It forces the government to use stricter measure to regulate the smokers. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country to protect our right and health.",B1
"Many people don't completely understand the effects of secondhand smoke and for some, they think of it as just being a nuisance. Statistics have shown that over one hundred thousand people die every year as the result of passive smoking. While it is probably an underestimated figure, it serves as a timely reminder that passive smoking kills too many innocent people. Public awareness is increasing however and many people, all over the world are starting to take a stand against smoking in public places including restaurants. While Japan does have several restaurants that enforce a no smoking policy, I believe that this is mostly because of building or department store regulations rather than any thought of how smoking may affect their customer's. If enough people speak up, then governments have to sit up and take notice if they want to be re-elected. On that basis, I feel that it is crucial that society as a whole stands as one and rather than condemn smokers, continue to vote only for those representatives who will take up the cause in government and push for sufficient legislation to ban smoking in restaurants as well as in all public places. Only in this way, can long-term change take affect and society in general, like it usually does, will eventually toe the line.",C2
"Work in a part time for college students is important. I agree with this statement, because I think it is very good for college student to practice to make a business or entrepreneurship. Besides that, there are many other reasons why to have a part time job is very important for college students is very important. Although college students are very busy with their study, but they still can doing a good activities like working in a part time. They can working in the restaurant, coffeshop, bookstore, minimarket, and in other places. Usually, working in a part time at 9 am until 3 pm or at 3 pm until 10 pm. So I think this activity is will not disturb their study process in the college. But, it can maked an activity before study or after study in the college. Most of people certainly often think that every college student is very busy with their study in the college. But I think if they can manage their time carefully, working in a part time is not impossible. And I think is it can managed carefully it's can't disturb their study and their study achievement. Because every things is depend of how individual to manage their time. There are many advantages of work in a part time for college students. For example, if they work in a part time they can increase their money so they can help their parents too. And then they can also pay the boarding house with their money from work in a part time, buying food, and others. Besides that, this activity is very important to practices become a good entrepreneur, businessmen, and many others work if the students graduate from their college.",B1
"We always read some news that talk about the modern college students' lives. According to this news, we find more and more college students prefer to have part-time job. Personally, I disagree with the opinion that having a part-time job is important. Nowadays the more colleges appear, the more college students appear. Firstly, we'll see more students who aren't rich enough to live in the city have appeared and have no choice but only to find a part-time job to support their living or studying. Obviously, most of us have no need to do that. Secondly, maybe we do not have more money to buy some clothe or other things, but unnecessary to worry about we can't continue our studying or normal living. Thirdly, for us, the most important thing is studying. After we've finished our works, then can we choose whether to have a part-time job or not in spare time? I agree with having an experience of part-time job is better for us to fit the society, but disagree with having the job can instead of having a class. Students dream one day they will be a rich man, such as Bill Gates, without graduated-degree can also earn money. Actually, only few of us can success. Most people still need to study and work hard to have a better life. We should realize our duties are studying not spend all the time on exercising living ability. In the words, I don't think college students have a part-time job is important.",B1
"I agree that it is very important for college students to get a part-time job. In this way, students do not only make a little money to help parents reduce the heavy burdens of supporting a college student, but also they will have chance to know the working world which will help them prepare for their future career. Moreover, taking a part-time job help to build students' personality as well as give them a rich social life.. At present, most teenagers directly ask money from their families and they tend to believe it is their families' responsibilities to give them everything they want, especially those whose families are wealthy. They have no ideas of how hard it is for their family to earn money to support their needs. It is quite likely that some of them might develop into ""spoilt brats"". What is more dangerous is that teenagers who lacks the knowledge of the difficulties of making money may have a personality issue regarding how they interact with the real world. On the other hand, college students who have taken a part-time job will obtain a totally different but clearer view of the real working life. They are able to earn some money to cover their expense to reduce the burdens of their families. Moreover, in the same way they can achieve their self-worth which in turn helps them build a health personality concerning hard working. Lastly, taking a part-time job means they will have chance to contact with other people, this will eventually benefit college students a lot and gets them prepared for their future career. In sum, it is necessary for college students to participate in part-time jobs. ",B1
"Agree In recent years, we often hear the word around is global etiquette. With the development of various communication and transportation barriers between countries be pulled down, and unify the world today, international awareness and to have been than what you think is necessary.

"The government stipulated that forbids in the dining room to smoke. The dining room is a public place. We must respect other people. The smoking has much harm. The smoking is not good to the body. Every year has many people to die of the second-hand tobacco. Now the dining room has the smoking area. If you want to smoke, you can enter this area. Every year, many people die due to lung cancer. Smoking makes lung cancer. It is a Invisible murderer. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. If you smoke in the restaurant, it affects everybody. At the same time, you maybe not allow enter this. My father is a smoker, but he can control himself. If he want to smoke, he can auto walk outside. He respects everybody.

"It is seems that a part time job is increasing in Thailand. Many University students also work during study. Because it is a good way to make money for paying something necessary for their studying life. Moreover a part time can help the students take responsible and taking care of themselves. I agree with this; the students should have a part time job. So in this essay I'd like to explain in two reasons of important part time job. First is students can make money during study. Second is part time job give us a good experience. Many parents agree with a part time job of their child. Nowadays many family can't afford for their children college. Part time job is a good choice for the teenager who want to study in University, but have no money. It is very easy to find a funny job. The teenager can find a job in fast food restaurant. For example KFC, Mister donut, The pizza etc. Some of my friends only study in University. They never have a part time job during summer or study. When they finish college I think it so hard to learn about work of them. If we have a part time job, we also learn to live with another person in society. We can meet many people and work with them through our service. A good time and experience will teach us in social working life. In conclusion I think a part time job is important for college students. Because it is the base way to prepare their life before get a degree. A pert time job can make us happy and funny during work and it is the first step of our work life.",B1
"These few years, the government has been actively promoting a smoke free campaign. Take for example, frightening photographs of smokers who suffer from diseases are featured on cigarette boxes. Also, they have imposed strict fines on trains and buses if one is caught smoking. This has extended to many places, including restaurants. However, I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers have their own rights too. If they are barred from smoking at restaurants, it will create a lot of inconvenience for them. Indeed, smoking is detrimental to the individual's health. However, we should consider that smokers also require support from people around them in order to quit. This takes time and effort. If we banned smoking completely at all the restaurants, the aim to encourage them to quit may produce negative results. Instead of banning smoking completely, perhaps we can consider the practice of several fast food restaurants such as McDonalds which have allocated smoking corners for smokers to have their meals at. At the same time, volunteers can give out nicotine gums to the smokers and raise awareness of the negative effects of smoking. Eventually, we will be able to create a smoke free environment for everyone. ",B1
"Some people who smoke are very rude. They smoke not only on the street, also in the restaurants. When they smoke in restaurants, other people who don't smoke feel upset. Smoking makes fumes and dirty dust. People who smoke have their smell of cigarette. That makes very discomfort. I think people who smoke in restaurants is selfish. They enjoy their smoking and do not care about other people who don't smoking. So what I am talking about is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some of restaurants have smoking seats, but there is nearby seats of no smoking. Fumes and durst move every table in restaurants. Guests in a restaurant might be angry if someone who sitting on their next table is smoking. Then, the restaurant is gossiped about their cleaning condition and etiquette. It is good choice to forbid smoking in restaurants for their owners. Restaurants are where people eat dinner. Maybe it is special dining for someone. Smoking can break into special mood. Apparently, It is very serious problem that smoking in restaurants. I wish that smoking is banned in restaurants as soon as possible. I want to eat dinner in a restaurant that no one smoking.",B1
"I agree with this statement. Because not every people smoke. I know that for smokers this statement is so difficult to accept, but we have to see the bright side for this statement. People who smoke are not going to smoke at the restaurant again, and that will make the restaurant atmosphere healthy. The smokers should be understand about that statement, because that statement are made because some reasons. People which are not smoke shall prevent the smokers to stop smoking, because it will make them unhealthy. Many people will have bad illness because of smoking. For some reasons the government prevent their citizen to smoking at the public places, that is because the government want to keep their country clean and smoke free. Smoking can make our world suffering, because of the smoke that cigarette had are contains so many toxin that could be dangerous for human, plants, or animals that lives on the Earth. Why restaurant. I think smoking inside a restaurants is dangerous, if at the kitchen have a gas malfunction, smoking will make it worse and smoking can trigger an explosion. As we can see all bad effects of smoking at the restaurants, we must forbid smoking at the restaurants.",B1
"Smoking in restaurants, it is not good for itself but also the rate Interlink who are around us. When the smoke consecutive daily Movement of the addict thing started up.

It may not be the same reason why you continue to allow smoking to today It is known that the reason why the teenagers start smoking. To be recognized as the peer group is also caused by imitating the behavior of smokers. From the influential conceptual art example of a close family relatives. Or Star Singer. These famous people influence teenagers' behaviors so parents should suggest their children and keep their eyes on them. if the parents notice that the children are trying to do something inappropriate in their ages such as drinking or smoking, the parents should warn them and point out some disadvantages or bad effects for them.

"Nowadays, smoking often becomes banned at the various places. This thing is good trend, for smoking has many bad influences. There are many arguments for and against smoking. For instance, first smoking is incriminated as the major cause of lung cancer. Cancer is very very serious disease. And it is said that death rate is very high, and treatment is very difficult. Second, at the restaurant, many people without regard to age or sex visit to eat delicious dishes, in various time. Possibly, some people hate smoking. These people would feel bad, if there are smokers at the restaurant. Although they have come from a great distance to eat delicious foods and to enjoy talking, it is spoil. And passive smoking is worse for person's health than usual smoking. Nonsmokers damage their health, although they don't smoke. If these person watch out for health, it's meaningless. Many kids, baby, olds, pregnant women come restaurants, too. Passive smoking troubles those people. Especially pregnant women's case, smoking affects unborn babies. This thing is very severe and awful problem. Recently, most of restaurants have a smoking seats, another usual seats. But it of many restaurants doesn't separate completely. It is meaningless. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.",B1
"Nowadays, it is not very uncommon see many people smoke in the restaurants. So people are discussing whether smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Some people think that smoking should not be banned in restaurants because they are smokers themselves. They think smoking help them a lot in many sides. But, in my opinion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. Here I'll give you some reasons of my idea. First of all, smoking is harm to people's health, not only to these smokers but also nonsmokers. Scientists have show that smoking can cause lung cancer, heart trouble, and so on. Smokers feel very happy when smoke after meal in restaurants. But doctors say it is very dangerous if smokers smoke after meal at once. What's worse, the harm to the nonsmokers who breath in the smoke is much serious than smokers. So non-smokers hate people smoke in the restaurants. Second, there are lots of fire accidents being caused by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the rest of cigarette on the ground. It causes fire and terrible disaster. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. If we do this from now on, people will have a safe and clean place to have a good meal and enjoy themselves. Smokers can smoke outside if they want.",B1
"Smoking is an addiction. A person who fall prey to smoking cannot get out of it. Smoking is bad habit and it should be banned by not giving advertisement in news papers. Smoking should be banned in all places but as the topic is about restaurants so, smoking should be banned in restaurants. The people sitting in restaurant try to adopt the lifestyle of other people. Children and youth follow the lifestyle of other people as they are growing stage. As the man is affected by his environment. So, if smoking is done in front of the innocent people they try to follow it and falls prey to it and never become successful in their future. One of the reason to ban smoking in restaurant is to save innocent children from smoking. The other reason is that smoking is injurious to health. The people sitting in restaurant are also affect by the smoking through they are not smoking. So, through the mistake is of one but the whole people in the restaurant are affect by this bad habit. As a result they lose their life. the smoking may cause to lung cancer and many other disease. So, smoking should be banned in restaurants. Government should take steps to ban smoking.",B1
"Is it important for university students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, it is optional that university students having a part-time job or not. I agree that having part-time job can benefit them, but it is not a must for them to have a part-time job. Therefore, I do not think it is important for university students to have a part-time job. Though working experience is a very important factor while looking for job, paying effort on study is much more important for students. Having part-time job will reduce students' revision time, which may easily slow down students' learning processes. Moreover, having part-time job after school makes students spend more energy a day, or maybe sleep less, therefore students may feel tired in lessons next day. It will also affect students' study. Rather than having part-time job, I prefer students to have a placement year or summer internship. In the placement year or summer, students can fully focus on the job since they do not have courses at that period. Therefore students can obtain the most from study and work rather than multi tasking both. Full-time job can help students to learn much better, it is not so important for university students to have a part-time job.",B1
I really agree with the this topic. Nowadays Most all of the restaurant have banned the smoking or had a special room for smoking and I really feel thank you to most of them because someone will occur the symptom of something when they get the smoke from cigarettes. Even though you don't smoke the cigarette by yourself but you get the smoke from someone near you who smoke the cigarette you also be dangerous too and if the girl that have a pregnant sitting in the restaurant that you are smoking It's absolutely that her baby will must get the dangerous from your smoking. I think it can possibly that if someone in the restaurant may be children or adults smell the smoke from the cigarette they can love it just one time or may be the children had seen you smoking and they think it was cool and smart and they took it to try and like it it would occur the many other problems like steal the money or do everything that they can do for have the money to buy cigarette and it can be the normal things for the other children that had seen who smoke it. Smoke from the cigarette can make the customers feel bad and bored and they might not come to your restaurant again and you will lose many customers and lose a lots of money that you have ever earn. However I think that it has many disadvantages of smoking in the restaurant than has advantages. Believe me all of restaurants please banned the smoking and I absolutely confirm that it will be good for you and other. To the smoking person please stop smoking or less smoking believe me and you will be fine.,B1
"Due to certain pressures of college life, there have been circumstances that make college students think that it is important to have part time jobs. However, I think otherwise. There is no special need for a college student to have a part time job unless they have no other choice. A reason for this is because they can negotiate with others to gain certain privileges or achieve goals. For instance, if a student wants to be more independent or want to try to become more mature, the individual can always negotiate with his or her parents. He or she should negotiate regarding the limits of his or her freedom and the amount of allowance to be provided such that there is no need to be too dependent on the student's parents. If the need for a part time job arises due to the lack money, the student can always try to budget with he or she has and study and work hard to obtain a scholarship. The individual should only acquire a part time job if he or she is truly left with no other choice. After all, a part time job can put quite the toll on one's studies.",B1
"Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Aside from the leading cause of death, it is also a source of a very foul and unpleasant smell. Today, even at schools, people are smoking and it is really disgusting. Some students think that smoking is cool but in reality, smoking isn't cool and in fact, it is very uncool and very disturbing. Our government should initiate the campaign to ban smoking at all restaurants, because aside from its very unpleasant smell, it is also very dangerous to our health. It is also a sign of negligence and disrespect to your neighbors, as not all people around you are smokers and thus some of them might be disturb and feel sick due to the smell. For me, smoking shouldn't only be banned at restaurants in the country but also, all the establishments as well. If you want to smoke then smoke at your own place, but not on a public establishment as it may affect other people around you. People know that smoking is bad to their health but why do they still do it? Some say that it gives a great relief to their problems while others started smoking due to their curiosity. But this has to be changed, smoking shouldn't be consider as an option to stress because it will not solve problems but rather add a lot of them such as lung sickness and other health hazards. In conclusion, by banning smoking at restaurants and establishment smokers will have less chance to smoke and kill themselves at the public. If this rule will be properly implemented, our government will not just save the health of the non-smokers but also, the lives of the smokers.",B1
"I agree with this following statement. Roughly speaking, there are two reasons that I think so. Naturally, the first reason is to get the money. College students need much money in order to pay not only school expenses, but also expenses for a circle activity. In addition to these expenses, they spend money for playing with their friends, meals and so on. It is not so good that they depend on their parents for all these money, because they are already adults or near adults, and this time is when they should to ready to become independence. So it is desirable that they have a part-time job to earn the part of these necessary expenses. Of course, it is out of question that having the job interferes with studies in their college. It is important to work moderately. The second reason is t experience working in society. Most of students become a member of society after they graduate. So I think that college life is a shift time toward social person. In this time, it is advantageous to spend their life after college life that they experience working and getting money by themselves. I think it is important to continue to work in same place, but I also think it is important to experience diverse jobs. By experiencing many jobs, they can acquire various abilities and broaden their insights. Because of these two reasons, I agree to their having a part-time job. But as mentioned above, it is important that working don't disturb their studies.",B1
"I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons why smoking should be forbidden. The first reason is that the smell of smoking can disturb the flavors of dishes. Foods may taste down by that of smoking. The second reason is that family customers can come to restaurants. I think that parents want to prevent their children from smoke. Smoke is too much harmful for what children grow up. So, in front of children, people should not smoke. I think that the last reason is the most important reason. The last reason is smoking does damage to not only the smoking people but also the other people around the smoking people. Surely, there are the spaces which are prohibited smoking at almost all the restaurants in the country. But the smoke flow widely around the restaurants. There are many people in the restaurants. So, at common place, smoking should be banned. Therefore, I agree with this idea. But I also think that this idea is sorry for the people who like smoking. It seems that they want to smoke after eating. So, I think that restaurant managers had better than to make a space for smoking out of store.",B1
"I don't agree with smoking. Smoking is not good for ourselves, but in Taiwan, many people smokes, even my fother. I remember when I was a child, I always forbided my fother smoked in our house, but it didn't work. My fother somked outside. I was disappointed, but I didn't give up. When I saw my fother smoking, I removed his smoke. After thousand times, I quite. My mother also told my fother not smoking or his health would be in danger, but it didn't work. I also saw my classmates smoking around my school when I was a junior high school student. My teacher punish them, but they still smoked. It was terrible then. After I went to senior high school, we changed our place to live, far from my father's factory, so that I won't smell so much smokes. I also had good grades at our new house, not only on my study but also on my piano. Maybe I would get a friend who likes smoking, but I would tell she not to smoke when she met me or dated me. I even got my best friend who smoking, but I don't care. I always told them that smoking was not a good hobby, some people would listen to me and quite smoking. I was so happy to hear that because I would think of helping a person to solve his life! Smoking is not good at our health, try our best to go away smoking places and don't touch any smoke.",B1
"The most important part of society mant student gets a jobs for their study. They gets job's because their parents cannot study them. They are poors. they cannot afford their kercha. There is nobody in their house to earn. A college is the place where student comes for study. College life is very happy life. A college students have many disers. But we see in an other hand in other hand many other student those who comes in college but they are not happy like other students of college. They have many disers but their disers cannot fulfill. they disturb in their study. There is different causes. The first problem is that, they are poor. That's why they have no beautiful uniformlike other children. They have no money like other children. But they are found of study. They are very bright student and very intelligent student but they cannot use for their mind. They always remain in tension. That's why they gets jobs to continue their study. That's why their mind is not only in the study. Their health becomes weak. Job's creat disterbeness in their jobs. Government should help those student. It is the responsibility of government of the student.",B1
"I am for that students do part-time jobs, for they have many chances that they spend money for mainly friends, lovers, parents and so on. As a result, they face shortage of money. Doing part-time jobs has another meaning for them. It is having social experiences gotten by working in social places not in schools or at home. They will help students when they work anywhere after they graduate from their school. Until they have part-time job even if they fail, they may be allowed with smile. But there are something's financial in social places, so they cannot be allowed at all if they fail. Even if they are allowed, next is nothing. Following this, students come to have large responsibility. Furthermore, money gotten by working may tell them ""real"" way of spending money. Not receiving from parents but earning personally may also tell them ""interesting of working"".  Finally, by working outside of schools their relationship is more extended and in the place where they do part-time jobs, many things taught by ""pre-runner of life"" enrich their life in the future. For all, doing part-time jobs will be something's that teach students many, many things that are important when they go through variable things and have their life lively. So I am for this.",A2
"I think it is necessary for college students to have a part time job, because these kinds of experience give student to valuable moments which learn about many things. There are several reasons to support my idea. First of all, students learn the importance of money, and they take care of money far better than before. Because through doing part-time job, they learn that it is really hard for them to make money. So they learn the value of money which they have spent very uselessly. Secondly, part-time job would give students to diverse social experiences. They have to learn how to hang out their boss in the office, and how to treat their customers by doing part-time job. Thus, they finally learn the real world which is very different from the comfortable world in the school. These kinds of experiences are very useful for them to work at the office after graduating the college. In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that it is better for college students to have a part time job. Not only it can give students to realize the importance of the money, but also it can make students to experience real social world which is very different from the school word.",B2
"Very often nowadays, most people think that education is the most important in their life. Many people have to finish Bachelor's degree to be accepted in social life. However, I believe that degree is not an identification of successfulness. This essay aims to outline the advantages and disadvantages of doing a part-time job during study in university. Most people have only one target to go to university, to get their degree. While, there are many reasons for each person. For instance, somebody studies because they seek for knowledge. Someone studies because of their friends or their parents. At the first time, undergraduates have many activities to do in university. In the present, doing a part-time job is very popular. There are three main benefits of doing a part-time job during study in university. Firstly, students should do freelance works because it helps their parents' expenditure. Secondly, undergraduates should have works as freelance because it helps their education fees. Finally, the numbers of university students who have part-time job have increased. They want to gain more experience that they cannot find in the classroom. However, there are three main disadvantages of having a freelance work during study in university. The first, students tend to concentrate on their part-time jobs more than spending time on their lessons. In addition, a freelance work make students exhausted and they will not have enough time to sleep. Moreover, students might not have enough time to do their homework because of their part-time jobs. Eventually, it can be seen that a freelance work can have both positive and negative aspects. I think we should give precedence to education first. Then, we can place important on part-time job secondly. Lastly, we should manage our time in the right way and we should have responsibilities in our positions.",B1
"I personally agree and find it distasteful to tolerate smoke when I am dining out and I am also fully conversant with the medical implications of all forms of smoking and all of the pros and cons. However on the surface, it would appear to be detrimental financially. The figures don't lie and there is bound to be some initial financial impact. Japan may appear to be better off by continuing to allow smoking in restaurants however, as I will point out later, this is not in fact the case at all. With Japan being one of the world's leading smoking nations, a ban would most definitely impact the economy and also restaurant profits. While studies have shown that initially, numbers increased when bans were introduced, over a longer period of time, there was an overall decrease in net profit right across the board. Be that as it may though and personal opinions and tastes aside, if Japan were to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the economy, they would discover that with the rising costs of health care and insurance, the cost of not banning smoking in both human value and financial value, would be far greater than not banning smoking.",C2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are many reasons why. I'll give three. Firstly, the experience gained from working to earn money and learning to manage the money one has made is a lesson that will last a lifetime. Even if their parents are helping with the tuition and they are only working to make their own spending money, they will learn to use their money more wisely since they had to spend time and effort to receive the money they are using. Students that are taken care of by their parents too much may lead to unmotivated workers that quit easily. There is no sadder story than that of a student that has finished 16 years of education without ever working a day in their life, only to run back home to their parents and live at home after college because of difficulties on their first job. Secondly, working part time may lead a student to finding skills they are good at but had never used before. A part time job may lead to a change in their major or it may change the student's idea of what they want to do for the rest of their life. A part time job can challenge a student to do something that they would not have tried just taking classes on campus. Finally, the people skills developed will help in any job, especially dealing with a boss and coworkers. Those people skills may also be good references or contacts for future work.",C2
"Smoking has been a controversial issue for a long time since it not only does harm to people's health, but also cause pollution, crimes and other serious problems. At the mention of whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, there has never been an agreement among people. Some people firmly support the ban considering the disadvantages of smoking while others think that smoking can be allowed in the restaurants under some specific circumstances as long as the policy is purposely carried out. Personally speaking, I hold the view that smoking shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, there are a great number of people dining out in restaurants everyday. Most of them have the habit of smoking or need to smoke while having business talk with their clients in the restaurants. If they are banned from smoking in these situations, their business will be affected and they will feel so unsatisfied that they may no longer eat in some restaurants which can lead to a lot of bankruptcy and unemployment. Secondly, since people aren't allowed to smoke in the restaurants, they may find other public places to smoke. Even if bans are carried out at all the restaurants, they may still smoke in any public places such as parks, buses, stores and so on. This vicious circle will do an even greater harm to our environment. Last but not least, a complete ban from smoking at all the restaurants is financially unrealistic. The revenue of selling cigarettes greatly contributes to a country's economy every year. In summary, smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country for several social and financial reasons. But that doesn't mean the complete permission is feasible. I think we should establish some specific areas at the restaurants for people to smoke. That will not only relieve the problem of pollution to some extent, but also promote the economic growth of our country.",B1
"I think I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because of these four reasons. First, a part-time job can give students many skills, many knowledge and many real world experiences that they can't receive from the classroom. For example, they can learn about life and foreign language from the peoples in their work. These may useful things for the best future. Second, a part-time job will make them to be responsible and to be on time. For example, they must share between study time and work time. Third, a part-time job can help them about their parents' spending, and it can teach them about spending money that they receive from working. For example, most students want a lot of money from their work to go shopping or to buy many things that they want such as cute accessories, new cosmetics, modern clothes, beauty shoes, ticket of the movies, notebook, camera, funny games, and mobile phone, but a part-time job will let them know that they would save the money. Finally, a part-time job can make many friends by working with other people. Students can do many part-time jobs such as washing dishes and waitress or waiter.",B1
"I totally agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The reasons why I agree are: The restaurants are supposed to be places where offer people great environment and services to have dishes. The smokers should stand in other peoples' shoes; the damage smoke is not they want. In the restaurants, there may be a lot of people including woman who pregnant. Smoking is really could be a damage to her and her baby. Besides, smoking could be a serious damage to our health and the people around you. If you are think you are a great father, you support your family and let your family have a smooth life, you have two little cute children, you have a beautiful wife and she is pregnant... etc, but you have a bad habit---smoking!!! Then you should think much deeper. You possibly get lung cancer after years, the damage of cancer make you have to stay on bed and couldn't work... last, you have no money to afford your family to have a normal life. Next, the second-smoke full of your house, your children, pregnant wife, are all influenced by it. And it cause a serious damage to their body... After picturing your future life, do you really want to smoke now? Finally, the restaurants are public places; the smokers should learn to stop smoking in pubic places. Or there are some pubic places have set a special space for smokers, they should follow the rules.",B1
"Society has more and more challenges for college students. So it is important for us to have much experience. In our country there are plenty of college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's quite common to see students to be busy after classes. But why is it important for us to get these? First, I think part-time jobs are a good way to count our thumbs. College isn't as busy as high school. When we finish our study, so much time is waste for playing computer games or doing other boring things. If a part-time job belongs to us, we will try our best to do it. After all, that's a way to show the ability we have. Second, part-time jobs can help us knowing more people. Colleges just have students and teachers. But society has quite different people. They do all kinds of work, and experience interesting things you have never heard. Through your part-time job you could get good interpersonal relationship. After you graduated, you will go to society. When you need help, these people can give it to you. Finally, it is the most important one. The key point is you can get the experience the book can't teach you. Practice is the way which could check the truth. If you only can talk about how to do it, no one will believe you. You have to study what should you do. And part-time jobs would let you knowing those. So college students' having a part-time job is necessary and important.",B1
" Nowadays, college is not only a place for us to study, but also a place where we can learn how to communicate with others and prepare to work in future. So, in my opinion, it's important to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows: First, it's a good way to relieve some students' financial pressure. For some students, their family can't afford to pay the tuition every year, and it will be a pity if they drop halfway. Faced with this problem, some of them turn to their teacher for help and get some money from the school. However, the money is usually not able to cover all of their expense, as a consequence of which, they try to get money by doing a part-time job. For example, a senior used to open a small store in Taobao and find a part-time job near the school at the same time. Therefore, he can pay the tuition by himself and afford his family some money. So doing a part-time job is able to help relieve students' burden coming from financial problem. Second, doing a part-time job is a great chance for us students to improve ourselves. My part-time job is to work in the piano room, which makes me meet plenty of new friends and know how to work with other fellows. Cooperating with people I'm not familiar with is truly a challenge, and I gradually realize that the skill of communication is really important. What's more, doing part-time job makes me understand how important it is to get along with friends as well as strangers, and that making money isn't easy at all. So, you can guess how happy I was when I was paid for the first time! To conclude, a part-time job is surely of great significance, though some of them may take much time and energy. Just manage your time and try doing a part-time job, and you may benefit a lot from it!",B1
"I agree with this opinion. I have some reason. First of all, we simply have to earn money. Also as a college student we need a lot of money such as school fee, train fee and so on that we need in school life in college. I think it is very high but it is important to try to pay such money because such expenditure is not for other person but for myself. Relying on only our parents from the beginning is not so good. Secondly we can experience a lot of things through our part-time jobs that we have not learned in school life. I also have been learned through a part-time job. When I entered the college I also began part-time job. At that time I was thinking that part-time job was very fun because there many kind of people and I can earn money easily. But I changed such thoughts now. I understood that earning money is very hard. Working is not the entertainment that we fun and is needed a lot of responsibilities. So we must separate work and daily life. Some people think it is common sense but it is very important things. I experienced many thought more than money through part-time job. So we should have a part-time job.",A2
"Recently, we had a discussion on whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job in our class. And different students have different views. Some students didn't think it is important. They said that, as a college student, the most important thing is still study, and a part-time job would influence study, doing the job is the things we should do after graduation. But the most students thought that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. They hold the views as follows. Firstly, as a college student, the most important thing is not study, but how to study. The university is different from the senior and middle school. The aim of study has changed. We study not only to get the diploma, but also to gain more knowledge, seize the opportunity to go abroad, or devote oneself to the job better. And a part-time job experience is extremely helpful to your future job. It can help you pass all kinds of face-to-face tests. Secondly, a part-time job can enrich our life. Now, the college students are always staying at university. They spend much of their time to have classes, do their school work, and play computer games. The part-time job is a good thing which is different from what they usually do. Moreover, it can increase their social experience, and they can learn a lot from the employee. As college students who probably will take part in job after graduation. The experience can help them to adapt the work quickly. More importantly, working together with the employees, they can learn how to the actual job and how to get on well with the colleagues. And all of these are very important. All in all, doing a part-time job is very important for college students.",B1
"Many years ago, the European has claimed smoking should be banned in the public places. This law considers smoker's health and the people who don't smoke and the place making. There is an argument about whether smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. In my opinion, it should be banned. Firstly, we are aware about how bad smoking is for our health. Smoking causes cancer, and heart disease. It can shorten your life by 10 years or more. So, smoking too much is bad for your health. You should consider your health. Secondly, in the restaurant, there are a lot of people. It affects the health of others. Second hand smoke contains hundreds of bad chemicals. This also causes their health problem like cancer. Non smoker should not suffer this unfair treatment. For secondhand smoke cause more danger than the smoker. Finally, smoker also spends large numbers of money. The money in smoking can be used in many useful ways. It can not be just used in such way. Indeed, I don't agree with people can smoke at the restaurant. In the public place, you have the right to smoke, but you should consider other's felling. If you can't quit smoking, you should find a place belongs to you for smoking. Please don't smoke at the restaurant.",A2
"I agree with this topic because smoking is bad not only with smoker but it also bad to the people around you. Smoking is the bad behavior. Smoking is very harmful. They destroy health and the weather. People die if they smoking for a long time and smoking is the causes of lung cancer and hearth attract. It should have the champagne about the harmful of smoking for quitting the smoking thing so it will reduce the smoker for the smoking. And the school should teach the children in the good way so it will have opportunity that the children will transmission the information about how bad of the smoking. Smoking has no advantage but they had only the bad. When the smoker is smoking, they not only destroy their self but they are destroying people around them. When you smoke outside you should smoke in place that make for smoking only. You should take care of the other because they didn't do anything wrong and you should not destroy them. Smoking is very waste of money and instead that you can take your money to your future. You should bring your money to do the many good thing are better than to bring your money to buy the cigarette.",B1
"It's quite normal for college students to take one or more part time job when they are on campus. It is a way for them to earn some extra pocket money and buy something that they want but can't get money from parents. There are various kinds of part time jobs available to college students invilving washing dishes at restaurants, being waiters or waitresses, tutors and some even can programme for software companies if they know how to write programmes. Despite all these advantages some consider it to be a time-comsuming thing for college students who also have a great deal of courses to take. They reckon that the time we trade for money now is far less important than the time should be spent on study thus resulting in a better job in the future which means more money earned. For those who take part time jobs at college, they think that the experence of taking part time jobs is a valubale advantage over those who do not have the experence of working with peaple, experencing what it really feels to deal with the stress at work or with colleagues. Here comes the comclusion, taking part time job means extra money and experence of working but less study time. So, if your courses allows you to spair some time to take a part time job, my advice is that why no give it a try.",B1
"Even though there may be some advantages to having a part-time job, I think it is not important for college students to do that. There are three reasons; studying time, sleeping time, and being obsessed with money. First, students should use their time for study because their real work is studying. It is a privilege of students to have such a long time to study and improve their skills. In addition, they pay a lot of money for college to attend. Therefore, they should concentrate on their study and do their best. However, part-time job will cut their time for study a lot. I think it is not good for students. Second, some students work for a long time and it cut their time to sleep. There're a many kind of part-time job, and I heard that some students work at bar or pub which open until late at night. Because of that, they work and come back home very late, it prevent them from keeping regular hours. Therefore, in the next morning, they're too sleepy to concentrate on their classes. It makes vicious circle in their lifestyle. Third, there's a possibility of being obsessed with money. In a part-time job, the longer you work, the richer you become. So some students who really want money can be a money-grubber and work hard too much. I think it can motivate them to earn money, but remove their motivation to study. It is very dangerous fact. For all of these reasons, I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.",B2
"College is a time for most students when their mind is at its most curious stage. They are entering a new phase of life and going to a place where they will be encountering new things. At college people make life long friends and to do this they share many of the same activities, such as swimming class or chemistry experiments or even creating a new light bulb. To work a part time job would take the student away from these activities which they have already paid for. The students should spend most of their time on campus; college is not just getting a degree and moving on. It is a period in a person's life that should be cherished. If a student is always going to their part time job they will miss the social ideas of college will only be able to attend classes. Being able to communicate socially as well as understanding the academics is an important stage when attending college. I feel students should live in the dormitory and take part in activities offered by the school. This is a time when the students will learn most by being exposed to group activities with their peers. Living together and sharing ideas by being part of the same dorm gives you a permanent bond for life. The student who goes to the part time job will be left behind because they won't be able to participate in many of the college activities offered by the dorm and social groups on campus. This is a time for awareness and creating new ideas. If a student is worried about getting to the part time job and doing work there it will take away from the main ideas of college life.",C2
"Living in the Philippines, a developing nation, I am no stranger to seeing the impoverished. Poverty can be seen almost everywhere. Studying in De La Salle University â€“ Manila, one of the country's most prestigious universities, I was given the opportunity to see the stark contrast in society as the slums encompass a significant area around school campus. From what I could observe, poverty has taken its toll most especially on the children. Deprived of education and proper parental guidance, many of them can be seen loitering outside campus. Fortunately, however, there are those who have taken strived or in local language nag-kayod to rise from the slums. There are those impoverished who diligently worked their way through college to earn a decent living for their families. One factor that enabled such is the prevalence of part-time jobs. These are jobs that are, well, not full-time. For businessmen it could mean fewer benefits to pay and the ability to be more flexible in terms of employee overhead. For the impoverished, however, it means the world to them. Part-time jobs can range anywhere from several hours work to several months. They range from cleaning other's cars or homes to tutoring their kids to working at fast food joints. Part-time jobs may seem as detrimental to some, as they won't have occupational security; it is, nonetheless, essential for others and in aggregate, beneficial for society.",B1
"Sometimes many college students gain a great knowledge of theory, while they really lack of practice experience. So I strongly believe that our college students need to do a part time job indeed. Several reasons are as follows. Firstly, you will be stubborn about something in your life as you just insist in the theoretical knowledge if you learn all the things in books instead of combining theory and practice. Be careful about the situation whether you are just reading books but do nothing. Secondly, after a short time of 4 years study in college, you are required to find a job immediately. It's certainly for you to treasure the time and to make a full use of the time. To do a part time job is a good choice, as you make your knowledge grow continually; you also get the practical experience of how to survive in the complicated society. Finally, you can add some colorful experiences to your resume when you are interviewed by a company, so you have the advantage over others as you have the ability to finish the work efficiently. It is all due to the part time job. In my opinion, it's necessary for college students to have a part time job to gain the work experience.",B1
"I disagree with this statement. Because I think that college students are coming to the college to study advanced things that they don't know yet or that they need in the future, so they have to concentrate on studying that they to do. I worry that the part-time jobs prevent them from studying at college. I think if they start to do part-time jobs, they need more and more time than when they are high school students. Then they probably eliminate the time to study or sleep to do part-time jobs. I also think to do part-time jobs is good for them from the view of being the members of the society. But as you know less sleeping tires them and makes them sleepy always, but if you are tough guy or girl, it means nothing. If you are sleepy during the lessons at the college, it means nothing to do study at college. I think if they want to study difficult and advanced things that they don't know yet, they need mach time and power to study hard and the time to sleep that keeps them well. In this way, I think to do part-time jobs is not so good for college students.",A2
"Maybe it looks cool to have a cigarette. However, the fume from the cigarette is more harmful for others around you. I do agree to ban smoking at a public place, such as restaurant. Today, there are too many people in China smoking and too many people leading a bad life. When they have a cigarette, their lungs will become black. And when they have one more, it will be blacker. As a result, it will maybe cause them a pneumonia, or a more serious disease. However, maybe you do not know that people nearby a smoker will be affected more seriously. Fume form a lit cigarette has much more poisonous substance than that is insoaked in. So it should be banned smoking in a public place, where there are many people. Banning smoking can weaken pollution and make a stable and peaceful living environment. When we have a dinner in a smoking banned restaurant, we will feel good though then we will have no bad feeling, which is our want to have and appreciate. I do agree to ban smoking in a public place.",B1
"I agree if smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country, because the smoke can make the passive people have a bader health than the active. Many doctors have launched that information long time ago. Nowadays, many restaurants have put no smoking icon at their places. This is for keep fresh air in the place. And for the smoking people, don't smoke near the passive. In some restaurant, they have some rooms for smoking people called smoking area, with good circulation air in the room, so the smoke cannot be breathed by the passive. And I think not at restaurant only that smoking should be banned, many public places have to ban smoking too. Like at the bank, airport, mall, and other public places. They have to preserve smoking area for the smoking people. And add some security men for keeping the place free of the smoking people. If they find some smoking people brake the rules, they can warning the people so the people cannot smoke again in the public places. The last trick we should do is put the danger of smoking can make us cancer poster at the public places, so the smoking people can think twice before they do smoke.",B1
"In a small and non-ventilation restaurant, there is full of disgusting smoke when you having meal. How do you feel? Obviously, it's not acceptable. In my option, it's reasonable to ban smoking at all restaurants completely. Although smokers have their rights to smoke when they need, they also have responsibility to let non-smokers enjoy a clean environment. Sometimes, in order to be convenience, some smokers just throw the cigarette ends on the floor inside restaurant. I think nobody would like to have meal at these dirty restaurants. Hence, the income of restaurant will be affected directly. Nowadays, more people concern about the issue of smoking ban as they are alerted the hazard of second hand smoke. The second hand smoke is as harmful as first hand smoke. For an hour meal, the smoke irritates our respirational system a lot. Because of the smoke, non-smokers have a greater chance to suffer from some deadly diseases like lung cancer. All in all, preventing the others to be suffered and having a nice meal, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants as soon as possible.",B2
"Nowadays, many students use their spare time to take a part-time job, it has become a trend. As a college student, to this kind of phenomenon I have some different views. I think, a part-time job, fully take advantage of our spare time, make our college life becomes rich rise. Meanwhile, we can slowly learned independent, and realize make money is not easily. So, we can learn save money. Additionally, we can make money by ourselves. This is a good way to alleviate the burden of our parents. Finally, the experience we gain through part-time jobs may be of grate help to our future career. Undeniable, part-time job also has some shortcomings. First, as college students, we should put study in the first place. Part-time job will be taking up the time for our study; we will not have enough energy to busy with our study. As a result, we may fail in our school study, which will affect our future career. Everyone has his own ideas. For this shouldn't do a part-time job, every college students have their own opinions. We should according to the circumstance of oneself make decisions. If you think that you can handle the relationship between work and study, so you can try bravely. Anyway, learning is the most important thing in our life at present; we should focus on our study.",B1
"As we all know, smoking is indeed dangerous for our health. Especially to the smoker himself. The chemical in cigarettes which is nicotine inflicts lethal damage to our internal organs, mostly the lungs. The lungs filter the air we breathe, and to this, we breathe smoke whenever we use cigarettes. There are commercials of cigarettes airing on various television networks nowadays. And all of those cigarette commercials have a warning in each end of their advertisement which says that, Cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health, which clearly states that, smoking can kill you> yet, many people still continue to smoke, most commonly in public areas, namely, in streets and restaurants alike. The smoker smoking in public areas is not only inflicting damage to his own lungs, he is also affecting the health of the people around him. This phenomenon is called Second hand smoking. Second hand smoking occurs when people breathe the smoke coming out of a smoker's cigarette. Regarding this case, scientists and experts say that people who unintentionally breathe the smoker's smoke are the ones who are mostly damaged, not the smoker himself. For this reason, smoking should be banned in public areas, especially in restaurants because of the said effect of second hand smoking on the health of the people around the smoker. One of the reasons why smoking should ne banned in restaurants is that, many people especially children dine in restaurants everyday. The children inside the restaurant would be greatly affected by the smoke because most of the restaurants today are ventilated. The tendency is, the smoke would circulate in the whole area because of the air conditioning system of the restaurant. For this reason, smoking should be banned completely in public areas and spaces, especially in restaurants.",B1
"Since students step into the college, a lot of them want to learn and get the most knowledge and more ability for working in the future. In addition to classroom and learning outside classroom can gave them more knowledge, include working a part time job. A part time job gave many advantages, because there are many things to learn and many case studies to receive for prepare to working. Is the learning outside classroom and learning experiences outside the classroom in mind the fact work, it easy to qualify when graduation. Moreover it generates revenue, which reduce expenditure from them parent. If they have tried, it might make them aware of their own ability or can develop better, for example: if some student can play music or have a good singing then he or she work a part time job with music, it can develop in him or herself. A part time job is considered important to students on college. Students who have passed the part time job are more experience than students who not used to work part time job. For educational quality, this should encourage students to work part time job for finding or develop their ability and more knowledge than in the classroom.",B1
"I agree with the above statement for a number of reasons. The most important reason however, is that I believe that anyone who goes to work, even part time, will better learn the value and responsibility of money and how hard people have to work to get it. By working a part time job, students will better understand and appreciate what a good education costs these days. Many students I knew in University didn't pay a dime of their University tuitions and only worked during their summer vacations. I myself had to work full time in the summers and part time through the rest of the school year in order to save enough for my tuition and daily living expenses. Furthermore, that experience of having to balance my studies, work schedule, finances and social life all at the same time, has benefit me every day since. I strongly believe that it allowed to do better in the job I got after graduating as I'd already experienced a lot of the requirements of actually having a job while still a student. Some of my co-workers who had not did not do so well A part time job, a full time job or any job for that matter can only be seen as a positive life experience for any young college student.",C2
"I think it is good for much people. My major is nursing, so always learn that smoking's bad point, and smoking is unhealthy for not only smoker but also people who near the smoker. When I was a child, I just don't like the smell, but when I grow up I learn about smoking's bad point, I really hope my father can give up this hobbit. Sometimes really have to use the rule to ban smoking at all restaurant, because advises are not effective for each smoker, so I am happy that have this rule. Maybe everyone has self's relax way, but I think mustn't effect other people, so I think this rule is reasonable and I also support this rule. B hepatitis is prevails over the Taiwan in my parent's age, if get a B hepatitis, smoking will deteriorate your health very much, smoking also have many bad point for we, smoker's respiratory tract will be sick and smoking will take we much money for buy tobacco leaf and go to see a doctor, some people just want to get happy by smoking, they don't know that will bring something bad in the future, so by this rule, people will be more attach importance to smoking, I think it's good for us. Hope someday this rule can do well in each place,",B1
I think smoking shouldn't be banned at all restaurants in the country because it can disturb another customer who having a lunch or a dinner in that restaurant but is very hard way if you want to banned smoking. It is very impossible if you banned the people who smoke because now days the cigarette company is the biggest company in Indonesia and in the some of the country. They have very big a career opportunities so if you banned smoking it's means that your country have a big unemployed degree because like I said before that the cigarette company is one of big company in my country. So If you are a good people I think you should go to the outside of the restaurant and find a place where you can smoke without another people feel disturbed because we all know that the people who inhale a residual smoke from the smoker who called passive smoke is more dangerous than the own smoker. I think In every country if the people have a self-aware it's means that smoking shouldn't be banned in all of country. The way to get a self-aware from the people who smoke is tell to the smoker how dangerous if they are smoking between crowd people.,B1
"Smoking is a personal right of each person and each person also has the right to not feel the smoke or even the danger and the consequence of smoking. Smoking in public places should not be allowed. The main reason is to make people who not smoking feel uncomfortable, although smoking is basically not good for your health then smoking is prohibited. Many people still smoke in public places, especially in restaurants. The restaurant is a place where people need comfort and nutrition for the body, but when there are people smoking, then comfort is reduced and many potential illnesses who come into the body. A restaurant is not possible to make full rules banning smoking in because they also do not want to lose their potential customers, so it would be nice if every restaurant had a special place for smokers who are already addicted in smoking, so that consumers who do not smoke will not feel disturbed and feel comfortable in restaurants and consumers who are comfortable with smoke billowing smoke in special rooms. but still better if we all do not smoke because the smoke we could not get any advantage, which we can only losses. So it is not easy to decide to ban smoking in a restaurant.",A2
"For me, the importance of having a part time job in college depends on the status of the person. As we all know, the status of the people in our world are not equal. There are people who are rich and there are also people who are poor. If the family of the students have enough income and resources to support their needs don't anymore need to have a part time job in college. Since having a part time job in college would just serve as an additional burden for them. Plus it is already no point for them to have a part time job since they are already enjoying their lives. In the case of the poor students who can't afford the expenses in college, whether they like it or not, they have to have a part time job if they still want to continue studying in college. Since studying college is very much expensive aside from tuition fees, there are also transportation fees, allowance, miscellaneous fees and others. Even though it is difficult and time-consuming, part time jobs can give them extra-income to support their expenses in college. Sometimes the wages of part time jobs are low but it would help them reduce the burden of their families especially, their parents.",B1
"Smoking laws have always been a hotly debated topic in Singapore. It is true that smoking is detrimental to the health of the smoker and everyone around, but the smoker also argues that it is in his own right and freedom in which he choses to do what he wants. As smoking bans are popping up virtually everywhere in the country, smokers find it more and more difficult to find places where they can smoke, legally. This is actually the intended effect of the government --- for smokers to smoke less/stop smoking because of the huge inconvenience factor. Referring to smoking bans in restaurant, I believe that following the general smoking ban requirements; all indoor restaurants should completely ban smoking. It is unfair for other guests to put up with the smoke and subject their health to risks simply because of other inconsiderate smokers. In fact, a large number of non-smokers actually detest the smell of smoke. However, pertaining to individual rights, I believe that some outdoor restaurants could cordon off an area for smokers. This way, both sets of people have a right to do things which are of their interest. Therefore, I do not believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. ",B1
"I agree with the statement. I show first reason. I hate smoking. Because smoking smell is very bad. If I see a smoking people at lunch, I feel unhappy and angry. The lunch becomes not delicious. Next, I show second reason. I worry about smoking people. Smoking is disaster for body. Smoking causes death. It is fear. Smoking looks very cool. But, I will not smoking. I want to keep my body healthy. I sometimes meet smoking person on bicycle driving when I drive my bicycle back the person. It is worst situation for me. The smoke flow my face. I must take smoke. I want to stop smoking during driving bicycle. Because, I think that people must not smoke everywhere in Japan. But, I think that some people will not stop smoking. So, we must divide people from smoking people and not smoking people. But, I feel it is sad. I know a good point of smoking. Smoking tax is very high rate in Japan. Smoking people may feel that high smoking tax is very bad. Conclusion I think that smoking people will stop smoking. Because, I think smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan.",B1
"Smoking has made many problems. It has no benefit at all. But many people still like and love smoking, though it has no positive effect at all. Smoking make many disease for them who love smoking, like lung cancer, and many others. Smoking also disturb the others who are close to the smoker. They can have a same disease like the smoker, even it will more complex than the smoker. They called passive-smokers. The passive-smokers will fell very disturbed by the smoke, especially for them who sensitive to the smoke, they can feel pain and breathless. So that, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Moreover, smoking should be completely banned at all public place, not only at restaurant. Where many people are, smoking should be forbidden because it is very disturbing others. But it specialize at restaurant, because restaurant is the place for eating and it will so bad even if just one person smokes there. Smoke can disturb our respiration, so we cannot enjoy our food for sure. It is why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Nowadays, there are many rooms which is specially built for the smoker. That room can be found at many places, like malls, airports, and many other public places. By this room, it will minimize the disturbance of smoke for passive-smoker, and also make the smoker will feel free to smoke. Although there is some people who are lazy to go to that room. So that, it is good if the government apply the rules for smoking and the penalties for them who break that rules.",B1
"I agree with this opinion. I think smoking should be completely banned at all Japanese restaurants. The reason is that no matter where it is the public place, I think that smoking should completely be banned. And now the place is especially restaurants. In there, many people who are smoker or non-smoker are eating meals. And they are having a fun to eat or to talk with friends. So smoking lead to non-smoker having uncomfortable feelings. Indeed, if I were a smoker, I wouldn't want to ban to smoke at any place. But, I think that it important to ban to smoke for non-smoker, because of passive smoking. It means that non-smoker can smoke, if there is a smoker near to non-smoker. The material which passive smoking includes is more dangerous than one which direct smoking dose. If there is such a thing for a long time, non-smoker may have a cancer even if they have never smoked yet. So smoking near to non-smoker may be dangerous to smoke for non-smoker. This passive smoking can be at everywhere smoking people are, and now the place is in door so it can be more dangerous because of too near to non-smoker people. There are some reasons that I think smoking should be completely banned at all Japanese restaurants.",B1
"Part time job is a good thing that college students should have because they will get not only money but also many experience that they cannot find in the college. It will teach them to be mature because they will meet many different people, many different events and they must solve the different problems that usually occurs in different ways in the period of time work. Part time job makes them have a relationship with other people and will practice them to live in the social. In addition, part time job needs patience, it is necessary so much because past time job will make them tried so much and then may be less their efficiency attention in their class, so they must carefully it and if they can't go to study because they feel tried from work, they should ask theirr friend for homework or any handout suddenly and if they don't do like this, they may be miss point; in addition, it may be lead them to get less grade.

"I do agree that it is important for a university student to do part-time job based a good time management. When we talk about part-time jobs, it is obvious something that is time-consuming. But the reality is that doing a part- time job can earn a handsome of money that can certainly reduce the heavy burdens from the university fee and daily expense. At the same time, your university life will be affected even through university students have a more feasible time schedule. For example, you need to skip lectures or you are required to work night and you will be easily frustrated due to busy workload. So, time management is far more important in university study. On the other hand, part-time jobs can provide actual working experience that can enhance your competitive in the future. It is obvious that an employer is willing to employ a mature employee with working experience that can tackle problems. Those working experience can at least improve your interpersonal skill, like communication skills, be patient. Sometimes it is hard to improve your personal quality only by the books. For example, we have language courses but it does not mean that you can communicate well with foreigners. Only through actual practice can improve own personal quality. Having real working situation, other than money earned, is one of the major benefits that we can gain from the part-time job. It may be a matter of money to do a part-time job.

"Smoking, we all know that smoking nowadays became very common with men and some women. Some people like to smoke after they eat they didn't care about other people who do not smoke and can inhale their smoke To my mind, smoking in public places, especially in restaurants and cafes must be banned. Restaurants are for eating, not smoking. People who do not smoke suffer from fume and smell. The scientists are sure that passive smoking is harmful for our health at the same value. Smoking is affected to our health. For example, when pregnant woman is smoking, she should understand that her unborned baby in the womb is smoking also. Moreover, his life can be at risk. Every year more and more babies are borning ill or even dead because of the bad habit of their mothers. Undoubtedly, there are a lot children and young people in different cafes and public places, and they do not have to see how adults smoke because they always learn and get experience from them. In the other hand, we live in democratic world and everyone has the right to do want he wants and this is a freedom. In fact, everyone must respect other people's feelings and we have to cooperate with each other. In conclusion I want to say that banning smoking is necessary measure for health of nation. In my opinion, we have to prohibit advertisement of tobacco on mass media and parents have to explain the damage of tobacco to their children. We all are responsible for future of our generations. Those countries, who had already forbidden smoking in public places had done a big step forward, compare to the countries who have not done it yet.",B1

"I am a proponent of smoking, which I consider to be a detrimental activity to both the smoker and hapless non-smokers. Considering this, I agree totally with the statement that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. ? A plenitude of research has pointed out the deleterious effects of smoking, yet the smoking subculture remains a real and annoying part of everyday life. Weighing between health effects ranging from smokers' cough to bronchitis and lung cancer, brought about by the many carcinogenic materials found within the cigarette, and the purported ""pleasure"" and sense of ""well-being"", smokers opt for the latter. ? It is not their decision to smoke which causes my hackles to rise; instead, it is the way they engage in this harmful activity that I detest. Smokers often smoke at will, and anywhere seems like a good place for them to smoke. That I offer have to take in second smoke annoys me to no end. At to make matters worse, it is not as though I can always simply ""avoid"" the noisome fumes by ""moving aside"". Smokers ought to realise that there is such process as diffusion, which renders so many of us victims of cigarette smoke and so passive smoking! ? However, this much being said, I can only hope for bans of smoking in restaurants to be extended to coffeeshops, and by that, I mean, ALL parts of the coffeeshop, not just a corner of it, which, considering diffusion as mentioned, is simply daft.

"I don't think that I can agree with this because here in the States, it hasn't worked out very well when they introduced bans here in a few cities. I guess that the air is a bit cleaner but now, everybody that smokes just goes outside so all that is happening really, is that they are just transferring the smoke from on location to another. One of my buddies says that he likes to smoke in the fresh air anyway. Seriously though, Japan has a lot of people and space is at premium so if everybody goes outside to smoke, then there won't be much room to move and they will block all the pedestrian walkways and in some suburbs, the small streets will be blocked as well. While there are serious risks for everybody that inhales smoke, moving it from one location to another is not going to solve the problem and will just create new problems. I think that the best thing to do is to just have separate restaurants for smokers and non-smokers. People can still eat the same foods and it just becomes a case of geography as to where they eat. Problem solved as far as the restaurant side of things goes.",C2

"In my perspective, it is truly vital for college students to have a part-time job. There are several points why I approve college students to have a part-time job. First, doing the part-time job can expand our horizons rather than limit our tunnel vision in the small campus. Second, it can strengthen our interaction ability with different kinds of people. Third, it can also accumulate our occupation experience as well as make us get used to the future occupation environment gradually. Fourth, it makes us realize that earning money is not an easy task. Last but not least, it shapes us to be more independent; after all we have to make a living by ourselves in the near future. It is no doubt that there are so many advantages when doing the part-time job. However it is pretty important that doing the part-time job shouldn't affect our schoolwork. When we do it, it definitely reduces our time and energy. We can't give up our schoolwork. We should strike a balance between the part-time job and the schoolwork. If we can both strengthen ourselves by doing the part-time job and have good performance in schoolwork, then we indeed create a win-win situation. Wish everyone have a golden harvest!",B1

Students will need to know how they act at work place, what they must do, and how they use their ability at work. And they need to know too how they talk with the boss, what they need to do to earn a raise, and learn a socialism at their work place. The second benefit is to help their parents about school funds. Have a part time job can help students to decrease their parents works, or to up his month income. It is useful for them that live in poor families and have low month income. The third benefit is it can help the preparation of a student before they have a real job. So students will not surprised when they feel something different from working. Because the level of difficulties between the real life at work place and the college life is really different. At college, we only get frustated from the homework or study things. But at work we can get frustrated from our boss, our enemy, or even our friends.",B1
"I agree this opinion. I have a strong opinion for smoking. Generally speaking smoking causes many problems to our body and to our daily lives. People lose their healthy body for long years smoking habit. Sometime lose their lives. And what is worse, it lose health not only people who smoke by themselves but also who stay with smoking people. It is too dangerous for us. And many smokers throw cigarettes at the street. There are lots of cigarettes on the street in the city. I hate smoking people. Especially I hate people who smoke during eating. It is the worst one. I sometime go to eat restaurant with my family. At the restaurant we enjoy the atmosphere and conversation and off course the taste of each dishes. About over 10 years ago, there were few restaurants which banned smoking. Many people smoked at the restaurant in spite of eating. All members of my family did not like smoking. So suddenly the smoke was coming our table, we felt very bad. And after that we felt tastes of the dishes were not good. Please imagine particles of the smoke attaching on the raw fish at sushi restaurant! The fresh fish changes bad one at the moment. Recently people learn the harm of smoking and have consciousness of smoking. For our happiness smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country forever.",B1
"Millions have died from smoking every year and it is a well-known fact. It is long proved that smoking not only harm themselves, but to others around them too. Exposing to second-hand smoke instead is more damaging than smoking itself. In Singapore, smoking in restaurants has already being banned. Not just restaurants, even in hawker centres and shopping centres only a designated area is allowed to smoke. Smokers on the other hand, think that this is against their rights and freedom. In my opinion however, yes, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Primary reason people visit the restaurants is to eat, not to smoke. We have to consider the various health issues. In a setting like restaurants with air-conditioning, smoke can plague and stink the whole place. Smoke can also trigger asthma and irritate throats. Food can become bland and smells from the smoke nearby. It is self-explanatory that restaurants can lose non-smoking customers as a result. Smoking in the public has already influence and encourage the young to smoke. If places such as restaurants and hawker centres also allow smoking to take place, the young will undoubtedly learn to smoke from the adults. Hence, in my honest opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and hawker centres. ",B2
"I agree because it is more important to safeguard Japanese people's health rather than to protect businesses. Without a doubt, smoking causes many health problems which have proven to be the case time and again. Restaurants should adapt to a ban without protest, because in the long run, they will be better off. For example, after a ban was implemented in New South Wales, Australia, only a small percentage of restaurants reported a decrease in trade. In locations where the bans have been introduced, there have been very few problems encountered. Hefty penalties put many businesses off the idea of allowing people to smoke and gradually, it has come to be accepted as'the norm'. The difficulties in implementing similar bans in Japan would include, but not be limited to, the policing of a restaurant ban. It would be extremely difficult to monitor all small restaurants tucked away in the back streets of many small suburbs. Therefore, the government would be relying mostly on the honour system where the onus would be upon the restaurant owner to enforce such a ban. While it may be possible for the police or some type of smoke inspector to make sporadic spot checks, it is doubtful that they would be able to cover every area on a regular basis.",C2
"Do you think part time job is good for you? I don't think so. These days many students want to have a part time job even high school students. When u went to high school, my friends had a part time job. So she can't concentrate study and class. She wanted to sleep. Her friendship drifted apart. In university, most of people have a part time job. Some people want to make their pocket money. On the other hand, they earn their school expenses by part time job. Because of they don't want to receive parent's money. But they are also can's concentrate their study. And sometimes they forgot their assignment. But sometimes part time job has good effect like they build their experience. And they work harder and they take the first step toward social life. But it is no good to high school student. When I go outside I can see many high school students work to wear high school uniforms. Some old people see that situation, they thought no good for their health and how to think. Why they want to part time job? Because of they want to buy some expensive things. So I think part time job are good and bad. But I don't want to suggest part time job during semester. If they want to something to buy, we can use vacation!",B1
"Smoking should be banned in any public areas, surely including restaurants, considered all the potential damages to the health of the smokers and the people around them. At the same time, restaurants are supposed to provide a pleasant dinning atmosphere to their customers so that they can enjoy their meal without annoyed by the terrible smell. It is universally accepted that smoking can lead to severe damage to respiratory system of smokers and even people who smell the smoke. Restaurants are usually crowded with people so that it is not practical to separate smokers with non-smoking customers. Nor is it possible to prevent the diffusion of the cancer-caused smoke. Therefore, it will be a public health issue to pose laws to ban smoking in restaurants. Moreover, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that everyone has the rights to enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. One might argue that smokers should also have their freedom to decide when and where to smoke. However, when they smoke in public, others are deprived of the freedom to choose their dinning environment. They are forced to intake the smoke while they are eating. If you consider the fact, smoking in public is just like any other forms of crime, to satisfy one's needs in sacrifice of others' legitimate rights.",B2
"I think that smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the country. Recently, I often hear the word nonsmoking everywhere. I think that smoking should be forbidden at place where a lot of people are because the cigarette smoke affects our health. Even if we don't smoke a cigarette, our bodies receive the harm if there is a person who is smoking a cigarette around us. Above all, it is said that children are more likely to receive the harm, and there are many children in restaurants. There are a lot of harmful things we receive by smoking cigarette or breathing cigarette smoke from the cigarette which the person around us smokes. There are some people who don't like the smell of cigarettes. I don't like it, too. People go to a restaurant to enjoy eating dishes. I think people enjoy the smell of dishes, too. If a person smokes a cigarette in a restaurant, people who enjoy eating dishes around there couldn't enjoy the smell of dishes. Of course, there are many people who smoke cigarette. Such people would have troubles if smoking is banned at all restaurants. But there are many people who don't smoke cigarettes, too. I think people who want to smoke cigarettes have to smoke outside.",B1
"I do emphasize that it needs all college students if you have a time. It has many merits which know in the future. Now you are grown up and help you get many experiences which can help you choose the best occupation. It can be piled up one by one from now on. This is very important for me because I have no any experience now. Graduate the high school when I was a final grade of high school student. At that time, I have enough time to what I want to do. So I decide to get the part time job. I worked in a very little office in the building. That's the first time of part time job. It was very useful because I met lots of people who were older than me. They taught me lots of skill what they know when I met difficult thing. And tell me about him or her selves. I think it was helpful to me but that was very easy. At there, there was a man who responsible to us from first to the end. He was very kind and versatile man. So I got many but I helped a lot that I don't have an opportunity to stand myself and solve the thing by myself. So in this summer vacation, I will try to get much hard job than before.

"Now, to be a graduated is very expensive and I think is very important for college students to have a part time job for make easier for parent to finance studying in college. Many advantages for college students to have a part time job. Some students do not know the value of work experience and how it can enhance the educational experience. Work would benefit to students. They are giving them money that they have earned, giving them satisfaction, fill some of their idle time. Have part time job make have own income without hope that money of parent. So we can stand alone if we will buy something we not hope money from parents. And it a satisfaction for this self because for have incoming self its satisfaction for student and students who work are more confident and possess better time-management skills than students who are not employed. In addition to offering a paycheck, some independence, and satisfaction, a part-time job can provide teenagers with both training and experience. Working teaches students about responsibility and can also reinforce what they are learning in school. On the other hand, experts agree that students who work more than 15 to 20 hours per week often experience decreased school success, which can lead to dropping out entirely. Working long hours can also limit opportunities to build friendships and explore interests that enhance a teenager's intellectual and emotional development.",B1
"If someone has plenty of time after his or her work, he or she can pick up a job, so it is called part-time job. Some people think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. While others don't agree with it because they think part-time job takes too much time. I agree with the point of the former opinion. Part-time job has a lot of benefits. First, it can prevent one from wasting time and can help him get some pocket money. Then part-time job can enrich one's experience and widen one's horizon. Sometimes, a part-time job can bring you something special like love and life-long friendship. Also, there are some disadvantages of part-time job. For example, it may take up one's whole part time and he may have no time to rest himself. And it can also bring us a lot of pressure as we have the responsibility to do the job well. However, part-time job is only part-time job. We can choose whether to do it or not depending on our own conditions. But part-time job is definitely a good chance to challenge ourselves and earn some pocket money. So if you can keep the balance between study and part-time job, you can have a try.",B1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. You have a part-time job when you are in college that means you make money by yourself. I think it is a piece of good news for your parents because this way may reduce their pressure. If someone has a job, I think he or she must endeavor to accomplish it. During this process, you will know how difficult your parents make money and you may cherish the money they give you and not waste them. When you do a part-time job, you may meet people who you are not familiar or even do not know, then you will communicate with them and make them understand you. Shortly after, you will find you are good at talking with others, which means you have the ability of communication. By doing a part-time job, you will achieve many qualities. For example, you have to finish a lot of things by yourself and your ability of doing things may improve. What's more, some jobs need you think about many ideas, so your mind also works, your thought is exercised. In addition, you will face different people and different situations, you need overcome all of them, so you should change your ways of solving problems because different conditions have different methods to deal with. Some people may say college students have a part-time job will influence their study, but I want to say that if you find a balance between study and doing a job, you will realize you have a opportunity to adapt to the society after you graduate from the university.",B1

"Cigarettes made from tobacco grown almost everywhere in the world and all countries almost every government around the world grant factory to produce cigarettes for sale to people. A lot of profits both government and enterprise earned each year. However, WHO knows the danger of cigarettes for smokers and non-smoker will be equal or even worse for their health. Smoking can causes cancer and many other symptoms. Smokings in public places such as public parks, bus stops or in the street which are in the open areas cause danger to health of people not only smokers but also non-smokers who are in the areas. If smokers smoke in the closed area such as in the theater, in the house, in the restaurant, in the air plane etc. can cause more danger because everyone both smokers and non-smokers will easily harmful by smoke. The restaurants are the place where people come to enjoy their foods and drinks mostly with their families if smoker come to sit together in the same restaurants and start to smoke can ruin the atmosphere in the restaurants and also cause danger to health of all people around them. The air-condition restaurants even worse when smokers start smoking their cigarettes because there is no air ventilate to get rid of all smoke but it will be in their breath and to all lungs of people. Government, especially ministry of public health which is realize health of people should issue law against smoking in the restaurants both non air-condition and air-condition one to keep people away from smoke of cigarettes. I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banded at all restaurants in the country.",B1
"I agree with this statement for various reasons. The first reason is because studying costs a lot of money and it should not just be the job of the parents to pay for all of our education. Parents work very hard and pay for education right through until we leave university. Doing a part-time job also shows our parents that we are mature and responsible. Also, when we enter college, we are no longer children and so we should take it upon ourselves to find part-time work in order to help with the costs. I also believe that when we reach college age we should be taught the value of money and doing a part time job helps us realize this. College should be a special time in our lives when we learn not only from books but from the people around us. Learning from people and colleagues where we work enables college students to grow up quicker and learn about ""life. "" Finally, doing a part-time job helps us realize what job we might want to do when we graduate. Those experiences could also show us what jobs we don't want to do when we leave college. I think it is important to have a part time job that you can learn many things while doing it. Parents should encourage their kids to get jobs as soon as they reach the correct age.",C2
"Part time job for student is not good. Because due to their health, study also effective. They do not take part in their study more bitterly. In Pakistan the prices of everything is very high.

The student those job, they do not take free time to their studies which effect because in the morning they go to college and then and the evening they go for job.

"I'm totally agree with this statement. I'm a non-smoker. In my opinion, I think smoking in the restaurant should be banned. Firstly, smoking in public does harm to the whole world. It is known to all that smoking causes lots of problems. For example, many diseases, fire disasters and so on. In recent years, the death-rate of lung cancer and heart disease are getting higher and higher. Then, restaurants are public place; each customer has the right to enjoy their time. However, smokers' smoke will pollute the clean air and let other people breathe in harmful gases. So everyone in public should be aware of other people's feelings, don't let your actions cause harm to others. In the end, I would like to say that many countries have taken similar measures, and have gotten well consequent. Now, in our country, more and more people come to realize the risk that second hand smokers will face, so our government should pay attention to this serious situation, in the meantime, take effective measures to solve this problem. This not only protects the residents' personal rights, but also builds a harmonious social atmosphere. It is good for every side.

"Smoking is bad. It can make your health is not good but smoking is also popular as locations as hospital, restaurant, home and college. Who do smoking, the people around feel disgusted.

I hope they will stop someday when they know that it is not good. They should love themselves and their family. I agree about banned smoking because it is very good idea to stop smokers.

"It was said that knowledge does not exist only in your classroom. In my opinion, it is good for college students to have a part-time job because students can earn more money from it, and it gives more experience and opportunity for students' future occupation. Having more pocket money is students' dream, and a part-time job can do. Most teenagers have a problem about lack of money. Some of them want to buy something special, but they do not have enough money for it. Some use money up before the end of a week or a month. So, they do a part-time job to earn more money. Although the job gives a little amount of money, it requires such a little quality worker that students can apply. A part-time job can be a great opportunity for students' future. The students can find out what they like, what they can do, and what they are good at. They also experience some critical situations and how to do with it. When they are grown-up, their experience makes them more efficient than the other. That means they have more chance to be successful workers. Despite of tiredness and a low wage, a part-time job gives college students a lot of advantages. The students can manage their time to get more money, more experience, and more opportunity that they never get from their school.",B1
"I don't feel that it is that important and only creates hardship for students when they are supposed to be learning as much as they can to graduate with high scores. I was lucky because I didn't need the extra financial support since my parents were kind enough to pay for everything. This allowed me more time to study and also gave me relaxation time as well. I saw many students who were always stressed and rushing around to get to the next class or start their job on time. It was a real hassle for them and a few of them dropped out because they could not cut it. A few of them said that they would return in the Fall or the next year, but that didn't happen and I never saw them again. I am not trying to sound like a hard ass here, but they were never going to finish college anyway I think. A couple of my friends worked and studied and they seemed to have their heads together and did OK. But I believe that they were the exception and not the rule. With all of the study that I had to do, I don't know how I would have been able to work and get the high scores that I did as well. Maybe that's just not me and as I mentioned, it's not something that everybody can do. Students would do so much better if they didn't have to worry about money as well.",C2
"Smoking is not nearly as socially acceptable as it once was. In days gone by, most men smoked in Japan. These days, however, smoking is becoming less and less acceptable as the risks involved with smoking become better understood. As a result of this, there has been much pressure to curb the amount of smoke that pollutes the air in public places. I agree that smoking should be severely restricted in restaurants. The reason for this is the danger of secondhand smoke. Smoking does not just hurt the person who is smoking a cigarette; it also pollutes the air and is inhaled by people around the smoker. Studies have shown that secondhand smoke can cause cancer. Therefore, you can get cancer from the smoking of other people even if you do not smoke yourself. The upshot of this is that whenever you go out in public and people are smoking around you, you run the risk of being exposed to secondhand smoke and therefore potentially developing cancer later in life. Thus you should be able to go to restaurants without being exposed to this danger. There are other reasons that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. The smoky atmosphere in a restaurant that allows smoking can make people inside the restaurant stank of cigarette smoke even if they don't smoke themselves. Also, some people are allergic to cigarette smoke and would have a bad reaction if they were to be exposed to it. Therefore, I definitely think that smoking in restaurants in Japan should be banned. People should be able to go to whatever restaurant they desire without having to worry about being exposed to secondhand smoke that could cause cancer, ending up speaking of cigarette smoke, or being exposed to the risk of suffering from an allergic reaction. Because of all these reasons, smoking should be eliminated from public restaurants in the country.",C2
"I strongly agree simply because we need to ask ourselves what is most important in this situation, human life or monetary gain. I feel that most people would agree that human life is far more important and since we only have one life, it is important that we do what we can to protect ourselves and each other, from unnecessary risks and dangers. Smoking is risky and smoking is dangerous and I feel that most reasonable people would have no problem in accepting bans on smoking in restaurants or anywhere else where smoke poses a threat to human health. I f restaurant owners were to calculate the figures correctly, they would soon understand that they wouldn't make as much profit if their customers started dying off or were to ill to dine at their restaurants. Whatever monies were lost due to an initial ban would be recoverable over a longer period of time. From a moral point of view, restaurants should not have any problem with accepting bans because of the obvious dangers smoking poses to their customers. Neither should Japan's government hesitate in introducing these bans based on the public's approval. In spite of whether the public or restaurants approve or disapprove, the bans should be put into effect.",C2
"A successful university student should have achieved the following targets : going out with somebody, studying, having a part-time job, living in dormitory and being a member of any school society. This is what I heard before going into university. It cannot be denied university students have to allocate their time suitably and hence enriching the three- or four-year campus life. Moreover, most university students are already adults, they need to gain some working experiences to, in addition to making money, prepare for their future. Therefore, it is admitted that having a part-time job is important for a university student, which agrees with what the must-do list suggests. My first supporting point concerns about whether university students can properly use their spare time and hence maximize the gains in different facets. Having a part-time job would undoubtedly takes up some time from the students, but this gives them opportunities to learn more about time management. The second reason regards the hyhh experience : acquiring working experience is vital to university students because it offers them chances to practice what they have learnt in school and learn something beyond books. The last reason is attributed to the most realistic stuffâ€”money. University students can no longer be the plants in a greenhouse. Instead, they should make use of their ability to earn for themselves, but should not keep relying on their parents solely. This can also let them experience the hardship of earning. In short, having a part-time job is not merely for money, but it is also good for the growth of a university student. The manifold advantages brought up previously should be strong enough to support the fact that having a part-time job is a must for a university student.",B1
"It depends on the person's need. Different students have different needs. For a rich one, they do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not. However, for a poor one, having a part-time job is very important. But there are some students will have a part-time job in order to get job experiences. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send too much money for me as allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to the restaurant or go traveling, etc. I have to deal with the spending myself. But having part-time jobs is not only to earn some money as allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily lives, and another, school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and can earn 95 NT dollars at each hour. Although, having a part-time job, for some students, is quite important. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided from my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different from different students. As long as you need, then just go to find one. But we college students all have to remember not only taking the responsibility to the job but protect ourselves",B2
"I agree the argument that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. College students should share their parents' burden because the tuition is too high by doing part time job. They can be motivated to save money after difficult experience for earning money. Lastly, they can learn many useful things. Here are some reasons for this statement. First of all, in Korea, due to the high rate of tuition students have to share their parents' burdensome by doing a part time job. Korea is one of the countries which have most expensive tuition. To cut family's economic problem, students can try to earn their allowance from payment of part time job. Second, most college students do not know how hard earning money is because they are familiar with getting money from their parents. Through new experience of part time job, they can recognize thanks for parents. Lastly, from part time job, students can learn a lot of useful information. For example, they can learn the way of patience when they feel angry and the importance of keeping kind and polite attitude in social relationship. For those reasons, I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job. In Korean situation, they should share economic burden and they can learn many useful things from doing part time job.",B2
"Many people do not know the danger of smoking, so many people who still smoke. And smoking can harm the heart, hypertension, and disturbances in people who give birth. Hazards are often told but not neglected so much that smoking or often referred to as """"active smokers.

Although the rules about smoking, many people smoking every where. In Indonesia there is a lot of people smoking, and it is so disturbing other peoples who doesn't smoke, that's why I agree whit the statement smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For example, if there is a pregnant woman, children, or old people eating in restaurants where there are some people smoke, that can make the peoples who doesn't smoke feel disturb. I think smoking is also useless, because we get nothing from smoking, they will only burning money by smoking. That is why I agree with banned all the smokers at all the restaurants. Because that give a lot of harms than good. It giving bad effects for other people who doesn't smoke.",B1
"Government should ban smoking in restaurant because smoking has many side-effects. Smoking is dangeorus. The tool of smoking is cigarette. And cigarette contains of many dangeorus substances, such as additive substance, nicotine, and many others which can damage our body system. For the active smoker, it also cause many problem of our healthy. They are problem of pregnancy and fetus (for the woman), lung cancer, impotence, and still many other problem. Going out from the effect of smoking, smoking in restaurant (the public area) will disturb many people who don't smoke or we can called as 'passive smoker'. It will be very impolite to smoke around the people, because sometime there are people who dislike smoking very much. The people will feel uncomfortable if there is a person smoke beside them. And it also cause the passive smoke get the side-effect of smoking. So, that problem has to be reduced. Moreover, many restaurant have the Air Conditioner (AC) in their rooms. If there are smoke of cigarette in the AC room, it will damage the operation of Air Conditioner because AC needs the clean condition without any dust or smoke. That is why in many AC rooms, the smoker may not smoke in there. So, it is important for the government ban smoking in restaurant. And it has to be obeyed by all the smokers.",B1
"I agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for everyone. Every year, many people died of lung cancer because of smoking. Although knowing the serious data, there are still thousands of people smoke in Taiwan and the world. Some people might say that they smoke because they feel upset or angry but I think smoking for negative mood will hurt the body more and will not be happier at all. Moreover, smoking will make environment dirty and disturb the environmental balance, too. Smoking in personal spaces might not influence other people, but it can't be forgiven to smoke in the public spaces. As in public spaces, it is important and must to respect other people. Restaurant is the place where to enjoy foods and relax, younger or elder people would go to, so I think smoking should be banned at all restaurant for everyone's health. Furthermore, I think smoking should disappear in the world that can make people healthier because health is people's best treasure and will have a big influence for people from young to old. And it is lucky that can be healthy live in clear environment. To protect our country and earth, the government should send or revise laws to keep people be healthy and maintain environment clear.",B1

Recently, it became hot news because one of government organization said that smoking in the public area is not allowed. That condition happened because that organization thinking about effects of smoke. As we knew, effects of smoke are so dangerous to our body. Not only it can cover our lungs with toxic, but also it will be carcinogenic that can develop to be cancer, decrease our lifetime and lungs capacity itself. Moreover, effects of smoke not only attack the smoker itself, but also people that surround him. And the effects itself is more harm to the passive smoker (people surround the smoker) than the active smoker (the smoker). In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only because it damage our body, but also there are few fire cases in the restaurants that caused by fire from the butts. And it will be something risky if because of little things like butts destroy all of materials and damage people's life.",B1
"What are college students doing at school? Study. Yes! But many would say that they are doing part-time jobs at the same time. Of course, it is of great importance! Apparently, most of us students are adults now. As an adult, it will be shameful for us to ask our parents for money. To be independent in economy is the perfect way to claim that we are independent individuals now! And we are never kids under the protection of our parents' arms! Secondly, and also the most important. Having a part-time job make you involved in the society. What people outside of school look like ?How they behaved? How hard is it for us to make money to support ourselves ?After went through all the difficulties we met, we will get a lot of experiences. When we graduated and also the next time we step into the society, we have the confidence to believe that we are already well prepared and we can do it. So, we will learn that money is not easy to earn and our parents are great. We ought to respect them and appreciate what they have done for us. I'm sure we will be more mature and more considerate to others. Doing part-time jobs is a way to see what life really means. Get ready to have a part-time job and try your best to prevent it making a bad effect on your study, and then you will get something surprised you!",B1
"There is an ongoing debate in countries all over the world about banning smoking, passive smoking and whether or not smoking should be banned in public places as well as restaurants. Many countries have already adopted smoking bans in bars, pubs, nightclubs, certain government buildings, bus stops, cab ranks and train stations. So, why not in restaurants? I have noticed that on several department stores, food floors in Tokyo, that smoking is either banned completely or restricted to certain hours. There is nothing worse than sitting down in a restaurant, expecting to enjoy a delicious meal, only to find that the place smells like an ashtray which messes the dining experience with every bite. Japan's Government needs to think more about people's health rather than the number of voters and ban smoking in restaurants, all public buildings and entrances and also, all public transport. People are dying every year from smoking or inhaling smoke fumes and this is completely preventable. It's up to the government to pass irrevocable laws that support this prevention and not be concerned about public opinion in this case because there can be no argument, smoking kills directly and indirectly without question. The government should display strong leadership and give a clear indication to the people that smoking will not be allowed or tolerated in places that can be harmful to people who don't smoke, around children, old people and hospitals.",C2
Part time jobs for college student is good for that student which have less reasons and less facilities as compare to other jobs are also for that students which are finanily not stong enough to fulfill their requirments. The part time jobs is a source of earning money. Due to this share the burden of their parents. If they are not economically strong and have no resources and their parents have no money to leads their education. The students which are having part time jobs are love their studies they want to establish their family and want to take care of their young brother and sisters. The part time jobs is a need for poor students due to jobs the student lose their health and progress in their studies. The job effect their health their studies is also effected the students have no time to take care itself and its family. The benefit is that they provided all that thing which they need for their studies and share the parents of their family. Due to its job have its self respect for earning money. But also on other hand its falling health had a worry for their family. And they cannot force on their studies.,B1
"Now a days most of our population is involved in the dangerous habit of smoking. The people who are unaware of the dangerous of carcinogenic aspect of smoking are mostly involved in this crime. These drugs are not only dangerous for the health but also for the people and living beings of the environment. The people of our society are generally involved in smoking. This is not only common in the poverty stricken areas but also in the society of highly organized people. Even the well educate people are seen involved in the pursuit. Now a days smoking is common in restaurant which is fatal for everyone including the person involved in this. It pollutes the environment and the several kind of food placed in restaurants. These kind of people are very annoying in the restaurants. Due to the smoke of cigarette, the delicious taste of their meals are destroyed and all their fun for some auspicious event is admolished. The smoke is also harmful for the asthemic patients. Hence, the parents and elders should be aware of the hobbies of their youth. Most of the youth of our total population is captured in this habit due to bad company. Hence, everyone should have proper check and should follow the rules and orders of restaurant and smoking should be strictly banned at restaurants.",B1
"College students were beginning to learn when they finished high school. A lot of them were younger about 17-18 years old. Truly, every student want to come to the university or college where have a famous section for guarantee their talent and guarantee them self about a good work on the future but the problem is a cost learning of a university so expensive, and many Thai family not rich so, some students must finding a good job for work at the same time when they learning at the college.

They will be a stronger and endurance with any trouble on the future when their education are successful. A benefit when a college students have work are the salary what is matter thing for alive in the college. Actually, the most important when college students are working is they should to purpose and carefully to their study and don't forget to practice. They must to find a time for prepare and alert with misunderstand subject. If someone can do like the previous suggestion. You will got a perfect life in the college and successful at the end.",A2
"From my point of view, college students should be concentrating on their studies and should not be holding a part time job during school term. This is based on the assumption that the financial situations of the family allows the student to fully concentrate on his or her studies. Unless the family is not able to support the student financially, every college student should not hold a part time job. In my opinion, the main aim of studying in a college is to gain new knowledge and to find out the student's real interest in order for him or her to proceed to a higher level of education in their field of interest. Hence, with the heavy workload in college, students should spend their time revising their school work and participating in school activities since it will be a part of memory that they could hardly achieve again in future. Part time jobs do provide the students with more work experiences, however, I believe these job experiences can be obtained after completing their studies. It may be recommended if the students hold a part time job during the school vacations, but during school term, it should not be recommended, unless necessary. ",B1
"It is important for college student to have a part-time job. They can help onself and parents earn some money. They might do it when they have free time. They may make new friends when they work at place together. They may make new friends when they work together. The work experience receive in the part-time job. They shell apply in the future. Besides they may study innovation of work. The part-time job can help they care develop oneself and grow is a adult. It is student's fantastic.

The make money at present is usually many people nave to do it because it is help us have factor everyday life. Many student in college think of be ashamed then no do it but student someone do it because have to sue to learn. They not be ashamed do it because not ashamed and do not people be in trouble. College students are period have power for study, work and to good do everything. So college student to have a past-time job are good job.",A2
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan is very good idea. There are two reasons why I think so. First, I don't like smoking. Of course, I don't smoking because smoking has much harm but don't have any merit. For other reason, smoking needs a lot of money. At these reasons, I don't like smoking. If I don't smoking but other people smoking near by me, the smoke may come into my breath. At this, smoking harm not only smoking people but also not smoking people. Now, smoking completely banned at all the university building. So, the same thing can do at all the restaurants. Second, smoker can smoke at the out of restaurant. If smoker want to smoke, he or she only pay the dinner's money and smoke at the out of restaurant or in one's car. Surely, there are smoking seat and non-smoking seat in the restaurant, but the air in the restaurant is a little staled because smoking seat and non-smoking seat are just exist in the same building. And the smoke has bad smell, so that is inconvenient for the person who wants to taste the dinner's flavor. For the reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at al the restaurants in Japan.",B1
"Addiction is of the main problem faced by modern world. A person usually starts addiction by smoking. So, smoking could be called the root cause of all type of addiction. Young people feel prey to smoking due to bad company or other factors like joblessness, failure etc. some people start smoking as fashion but then it is very difficult to leave smoking. Smoking is very injurious to health. According to research it is the cause of lung cancer ultimately causing death. It is also said that a cigarette reduces the average age of a person. Cigarette smoke contain nicotine which is equally harmful to the person sitting beside the smokers and do not smoking. Smoking has a large number of side effects. It is very harmful for the non-smokers as many people are allergic to its smoke. Smoking is not allowed at many public places but people do not follow the rules and smoke. For example, at college or university level smoking is prohibited but the student keeps these restrictions beyond and smoke without any fear. Smoking at the places like restaurants is unbearable as it produces allergic reactions to the young children and other people visiting the place. Moreover the smokers put the ash on the floor and dirtily the place. Therefore smoking should be strictly banned at all the places especially public places like restaurants etc.",B1
"I don't support the idea of banning smoking completely in all the restaurants. Though I think it's necessary to set up some bans to limit the smokers properly. We all know that smoking is bad for health, not only for the smokers themselves, but also the innocent second-hand smokers, like me. For the health of us, the smokers should consider the non-smokers. And in return, should non-smokers also think for the smokers? If on some conditions, their smoking does not affect us much, why must we set up so inflexible bans. For example, not all the restaurants are crowded in all the time. Maybe sometimes, restricting people by moral is more efficiency and comprehensive than the law. I think smoking is a generation problem, and we can not carry the smoking bans too far and too widely. To some degree, smokers also have the right to smoke, isn't it? Maybe some of us are addicted to the computer games. I think what computers to us are what cigarettes to smokers. It's not hard to imagine how difficult it is to control smoking, let alone throwing it completely. My father is a smoker, too. And for my health, when being with me, he never smokes. Sometimes, when he really wants to smoke, he will go to a corner to smoke. All in all, I don't agree the idea to ban smokers smoking in all the restaurants.",A2
" Everybody needs a job, and someone need job. But what about having a part job? When we in university, did we need to and should have a part job My idea about this question is that it has to be decided after clearly know oneself. As we all know each people is different from others. Firstly, our dreams are different. Some examples, some want to be a normal worker, and some want to be a scientist. Secondly our experience is also different, some have known our society a lot, but some have not known our world will; some can communicate with others easily, but some can not. So we have to make our own decisions. Maybe someone around you has a good reason to get or not to do a part job, but you had better to think about yourself after know yourself really. On the other hand, we must know what a part job can bring to us. A part job can give you a place to work, can bring you some money. It also can let you have a good chance to improve your skill. And we also have to get an opinion that a part job would do harm to you at the same time. Having a part job, you would have less time to study, to play basketball, to read the books you like and you want to read and so on. To have a good knowledge of yourself and what you meet with is very important. A part job is a just a part job, do not let it bore you. And you only make your own decision. you should and have to do what you like.",A2
"After the horrific college entrance examination, we 17 or18-year-old boys and girls came to the campus. The world seems to be open to us. All things attract us. The activities in school are more than we can imagine. The life is full of happiness. But when we look back, we'll see it's important to have more experience and to learn more from college. And it's true that more and more companies pay attention to the social skills. So doing part-time job becomes very popular among college students. What can we get so far? First of all, students can promote their study through part-time job. For example, if an educational student take a part-time job in a school, his experience will enable him to better understand what he learned from the books. There's more. The student can get more opportunities beyond what he has been taught in a class, and he will know something that doesn't exist in books but in practice. Besides, students can develop some other talents in other areas. At last, they will discover their sense of self-worth and develop their future job hunting. The full-time job will be warmed up from a part-time job, and then they will gain great achievement. We'll see that money is difficult to earn. It remains us to be simple and unadorned. It's important and necessary to have a part-time job, and more students should follow it. That's the conclusion.",B1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Universities have raised steadily the tuition. Some parents can no longer afford the fee. So. Students are working part-time to earn his pocket money. I think that the part-time job will be an invaluable experience before social life. And many college students are working for his school expenses. Students work several part-time a day. They work mostly at a convenience store and restaurant and cafe and parcel service. They work hard, and don't earn much. Because student receive unfair treatment to reason young. It cannot be justified any reason. They combine study and part-time. It's not easy to combining. I'm done it before. I'm too tired physically and emotionally. The part-time job demand too much time. Students sleep to catch up on his sleep in the class. So, students have become indifference from study. Part-time job is important to them. We are no telling that quit the part-time. Because par-time is maintain their existence. So, university should arrange ways that scholarship system increase etc. They have to help practically to students suffering from financial hardship. Therefore I consent that it is significant for university students to have a part-time job.",A2
"Part time job majority students will be to work. Someone to work for to look experience someone to work because with to look add revenue besides thing the parent. But someone to work for to self support because the position poor and can target to finish. In society of Thailand. There are many students must do part time job that occur several reason to do work. Why students must do part time job. First of all, For some student is poor status. They are usually borrow money from government to study that not enough money to study. So, students should do part time job. Second, they may be very experience from real job that teaching a lot. Such as, attempt, anger, honest and endure. It doesn't same study in the class room. Third, want money to buy books and food or something. Finally, they are use free time to be useful. This is very important reason because use free time for job better than shopping with their friend. Some people can thinking and understandable are most important. In my opinion student do part time job that is a good opportunity and most correct because part time job have useful a lot.",A2
"Yes it should be because restaurant is an establishment were people who wants to eat not for smoking. Smoking should be banned not only in restaurant but I think in all public places. It's almost the same to those people who do not smoke because if they go out to restaurant they would be able to smell the smoke coming from smokers. Smoking is dangerous to our health, it can give us many kinds of illnesses that can affect our body and will cause death. And because of smoking, many innocent people who are not smoking will be affected and I think second smoker is more bad than the person who is smoking. And now, I think there was already a law states that if you're caught smoking in public places, someone will arrest you and pay for the penalty. And I think if we're going to collect the money that they will be going to buy for a piece of cigarette we will collect more money and we should donate it instead of smoking. In that way, our health is not in danger and most of all, it will help other people for the small amount that you will be going to donate.",B1
"I agree with the statement, because we can learn a lot of things in working part-time. First, we can see how hard we survive in our society. Working every day is very hard. And we encounter a variety of difficult about working itself, human relations in the office, binding ourselves by work and so on. When we graduate from our college, we will start to work. We can't live without effort and difficult. Second, we can earn. It's no wonder, but it's very important. If we had no money, we could buy nothing. It means that we can't have any house, any food and any clothes. We can't live without money. Lastly, we can make good human relations. We live with a lot of people and they help us or we do them. And we often have to get along with difficult people. None can live alone, so it's quite important in our life. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have actually learned the above things in working. I want to continue working unless it gives bad effect for my everyday study.",B1
"I quite agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. However, this is very complicated because in general, Indonesian people are people who really do not discipline against a regulation, especially laws that they think are not important and interfere with their comfort. This used to be very regrettable because I saw a lot in public places is primarily Restaurant banned smoking even though it is already marked but the smokers still smoke in the venue. This is of course very disturbing, especially for consumers who do not smoke in the restaurant - others, especially women and children. And if the smokers are in general warned they would be offended and angry. One which I think is very funny and absurd. We will not be able to become a great nation if the people manage discipline alone cannot. I see the efforts were good enough to provide a place for smokers and banning smoking in public places, but it will not work if no strong action for the perpetrators. So I think for every restaurant should provide special places for smokers with a short distance with other consumers who do not smoke. This is for maintaining the health and future of society itself.",B1
"I agree and would give my support to a ban like this and not just in Japan. Everybody in the world must know by now, about the dangers of smoking for anyone that smokes and also to passive smokers. I am mildly surprised that Japan has taken it's time when considering this or should I say implementing it. I know that there are a few places in Japan where smoking is prohibited but that on its own is not enough. Food is prepared in restaurants and children go to family restaurants, so why doesn't whatever health authority or laws related to health and the food industry in Japan cover smoking in restaurants already. Cigarettes contain dangerous chemicals and toxins that kill and should not be allowed to just float through the air and settle on food or be inhaled by diners in any restaurant or food mall or let's take it a step further, in any public place. There are beaches in parts of the USA where smoking is prohibited so, why not restaurants in Japan. Time to wake up and remember that all of the deaths caused by smoking are preventable so, how about preventing them legally? Like say, now?",C2
"As we know, it is not few there are college students who have a part time job. There are many reasons why they do that. Such as : to add a pocket money, to pay cost of them boarding house, to help them parents, to pay them daily necessary, and more. I think, this activity is very well. There are many positive effects if college students have a part time job. I think so, because it can make them more adult emotionally. The positive effects that I mean is such as: they will know that to find money or get a job is difficult. So, it will grow to them sociality. In other hand, they will be careful to use them money because as far as they know that to find money is not easy. So, it can make them grow more adult. In other topic, the college students who have a part time job must cleverly to manage them time. Because if they can't manage them time. It can disturb them college activities. If it will be happen, it is equal broken them college activities. It can make brake them soul. So, it must have been avoided. From some statements above, I take the conclusion that it is important for college students to have a part time job if they can manage them time nicely.",B1
"I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan and I have many reasons for this opinion. First, I think that smoking is very dirty and is very bad for all the people who do it. It would be a nice gift to smokers to give them a good motivation an opportunity to quit smoking, as people who smoke often have a very difficult time quitting on their own due to the addictive effects of nicotine and other chemicals contained within cigarettes. Next, it is not fair to nonsmokers to have to eat in a restaurant that is filled with cigarette smoke because they have to breathe that in and it is worse for their health than it is for the smokers. Secondhand smoke really can kill people, and I did have one friend who grew up in a household in which his parents smoked very heavily, and he had health problems for a long time. Once he moved out of that house, he became much more healthy and vibrant. Smoking is bad for you no matter where you are in the world, so I think that Japan should ban smoking at the restaurants in the same way that the U. S. is beginning to ban smoking at the restaurants here too.",C2
"This generation part time jobs among college students are increasing. As what I have observed in fast foods such as Mcdonalds, I noticed that many are young, young as college students. There are also known as working students. As I can see, it is hard for them, they are studying and at the same time there working. College students who are working in part time jobs are increasing. It just shows that at a young age many are now working even though it is just a part time job. In my opinion that does not seem right, but still there is a part of it that I like, at a young age students can already experience how to work, but the negative thing is, they somewhat cannot enjoy their youth. In reality it's alright to wok if they are already in the right age. I have encountered people who are working students. When they shared their experiences, I was stunned and amaze, that is why I admire them. Working while studying? That is hard. I believe that part time jobs are also good. It can help people to be stronger. How? Just by getting along with other people, studying while they are working, I can say that you can be stronger just by that, especially the college students.",B1
"As an accountant, I believe that this is important and would go a long way towards improving student's financial education. Students can learn first hand, valuable financial skills such as budgeting, basic assets and liabilities assessment and the dollar value of compounding, as well as the implications that this can have on their financial futures. It is a great opportunity indeed, if they learn it, understand it and most importantly, apply it. I believe that students need to take a broader perspective when assessing the value of part-time jobs simply because it is more than just a little extra cash or immediate financial relief. I know from experience that while most colleges and financial institutions do teach sound financial basics, there are still many students who fail to understand the true power of numbers in the dollar sense. Further, I would say that there are many people who do learn sound money management but fail to develop true financial acumen which is more than just adding numbers, it is about investing prudently and having their investments work for them rather than them working for their investments. If students were taught true financial acumen and then learned to apply it much like'on the job training' with their earnings from part-time work, they would not only improve the quality of their own lives but if everyone also applied those principles, then it would surely give the economy a much needed boost.",C2
" Smoking cigarettes is not a good habit, because it is harmful to both smoker and people around him. So I think smoking should be strictly forbidden in public places. Firstly, smoking in public places is impolite to others. Everyone has its right to enjoy in public places, while smoking pollutes the air we breathe, thus worsen our working efficiency. Secondly, smoking is extremely harmful to our health. The nicotine contained in cigarette may get us addicted to smoking gradually. Cigarette is the chief cause of lung diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancers. According the survey of World Health Organization, more than 8000 people died of cancer everyday. However, smoking is not only harmful to the smoker's health, but it also hurts people staying with the smoker as well. It's called 'Passive smoking' and it not less harmful than smoking by oneself. Thirdly, smoking may be a threat to safety as well. Burning cigarettes may ignite things around that can burn easily, and finally cause a big fire. An unconsciously dropped cigarette end may cause a great loss of material and life property. In addition, smoking is a bad education to the next generation. In many families, sons gain the habit of smoking because his father smokes. In conclusion, smoking is an improper behavior in public places, for it's harmful in many aspects. So smoking should be prohibited in public places for everyone's sake.",B1
"If you are a student what will you do when you have time in school Students can find a part time job if they can when they are in university or collage because it can give you a lot exercise and you can get a lot of success from that, not just money but friends, you can do something better when you do part time job, friends is the best way when you do something, If you get hard you can ask help from them no matter where you are, no matter what will you do, no matter who you are, this is a very unforgettable value you own, if you are old you can think about that time you do these things, you can find it is very beautiful, now parents is very hard to do the job and for our family, so do part time job is a good way to do something to relax and help our family. Many people think it is unusual to do a part time job, they play games or shopping in the stores, waste of time and waste of money, ran money is hard but waste of money is easy, many people is poor because they do not work hard and they have no sign in their life ways, in your life you have many chance and you have many choice, if you lost it, perhaps, it is forever.

"In today's world, a part-time job is starting to become common even before college such as in high school or in some rare cases even before that. This goes to show the kids are getting more responsible overall, and so it would make sense to say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as well. In today's world, the fact that so many young kids have part-time jobs should be a motivation for those that do not to keep up with their peers. Next, college students these days probably have more personal and tuition expenses than those in the generation of our parents, and so we should help our parents out at least in spirit by getting a part-time job to show them that we are investing in our own educations as well. There are also many people who claim that having a part-time job takes valuable time that a student should spend studying away from them. In some ways I agree with this, but I think that most kids today are good enough at multitasking to handle balancing a variety of activities and uses of their time. Things in the world keep getting faster and faster, and if we do not change to keep up with them, we will fall behind.",C2
"Nowadays, the graduations of university are not always getting a job when they finished their studying. So, I think college student should have part time job. There are many reasons for this opinion. First, the part time job can help them in increasing experience of job before they apply CV (curriculum vitae) in looking for job. Because as we know, A company or organization of society will offer an employer who has many experiences in his job. The second reason is better for their society, because a great student isn't only clever in their lesson but also clever in their society, because a science will be useful if we divide it with other. The third reason is it can increase their knowledge,. As we know, we may learn some experience when we work part time. The fourth reason is can help their economy, so their income will increase and also it help their mother job, especially who has low economy. The fifth reason is the part time job can support their life not only depend on other people, so they can be independent and solve their problem by their selves. The last reason is it will make them easier in getting a job as soon as they finished their studying. It also can decrease many unemployed in our country.",B1
" Now, quite a lot of college students take an active part in part-time jobs. They think part-time job can have many advantages. On the one hand, they are eager to develop their ability and broaden their horizon in face of the pressure of employment. One the other hand, with a large portion of their living expense and tuition covered by their parents, they want to earn some money to decrease the pressure their parents are shouldering on. In addition, if they take part-time job, they can get many experiences from them. However, there are still many college students who have never take a part-time job. They are unwilling to challenge themselves and reluctant to do it. They think their first task is to study rather than a part-time job. What's more, some students say that they are busy. I believe that the so-called busy is just an excuse. Personally speaking, a part-time job is quite necessary for a college student. College is no longer like the high school. It's a place whose purpose is to cultivate independent and intelligent person. So if you have more time after you classroom time, try to take your chance to find a good part-time job. You will have many benefits.",A2
"It is very important for a college student to have a part time job due to the fact that having a part time job can teach college students many things such as independence, responsibility, and hard work. But most of all, the most important thing in having a part time job is gaining knowledge that can't be taught on school such as application and real work because usually at schools, teachers only teaches us theories and basic knowledge but by having a part time job we can apply and utilize them. Students can also maximize their skills and time by having a part time job and thus could grow into more mature individuals. Aside from learning a lot of things, college students will also learn how to value their time and money because by working and realizing how hard it is to gain money independently, they will start to appreciate all the hard work that their parents had done just to support them. Student will also learn how to manage their time well because having a part time job while studying isn't easy, it's like adding an extra load to your curriculum. That's why having a part time job is important because it teaches us a lot of things we can't learn at school, it may be hard but the end it will play a major role in our future. In conclusion, college student should really have a part time job, financially capable or not because by having so, we, college students would grow more and maximize our talents.",B1
"People are banned from smoking at some restaurants. I think that it is a good idea. This is because smoking do harm to many people at some aspects. First, smoke of cigarettes causes healthy damage. Even if people don't smoke at all, they may suffer from lung cancer in the future by breathing in smoke of cigarettes. Recently, many seats at restaurants are separated smoking seats and no-smoking seats. In that situation, however, the clerks breathe in smoke of cigarettes, and customer near the smoking seats are also affected by it. Second, many people dislike the smell and the dirty of cigarettes. In fact, I dislike it. When I take a Shinkansen, I am sometimes annoyed by it. The smell of cigarettes sticks not only to smoker's clothes but also to other people's clothes. Moreover, it sticks to seats, curtains, table covers, and so on. If customers who don't like cigarettes smell it, they will be uncomfortable. In addition to it, the dirt of cigarettes ruins an atmosphere at the restaurants. The clerks there have to clean more carefully to make the customers comfortable. Accordingly, I think that it is a good idea to set smoking room. In that case, nonsmokers aren't damaged by the smoke of cigarettes. People can enjoy eating at restaurants under the great circumstance.",B1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons why it is important. First of all, In order to maintain their livelihood. There is many students who under difficult. We can't live if you do not eat something. If there is no energy, no life can live. Second reason is conversation skill. It is very important because we need social skill in social. We should talk to other people what you need. It will learn from real life rather than learning. I believe that this help to prove this skill in Part-time job. When it is important you do not tell, cannot get what you need. You can continue to say that the opportunity is at part time job. And last reason is Univ. Major. I hope that if you want to have a part time job, consider what your major is and what kind of part time job will help us. For example my case, my major is English literature. To study English and to level up my, I will find kind of part time job which is related English. As these reason, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1
"Recently, smoking has been banned at many places such as planes, buses, trains and so on. That is because smoking troubles many people. Tobacco has many toxic chemicals. Smokers sometimes suffer from serious diseases, such as lung cancer. Besides, smoking does harm not only to smokers but also to non-smokers. Non-smokers can breathe smoke and fall sick if they are near smokers. It is called passive smoking. Some non-smokers will know this and hate tobacco. Especially, in the restaurant, many people will enjoy eating and talking with friends or families. If some people smoke, the restaurant is filled with smoke and people feel unpleasant. Then, they can no longer enjoy talking and taste dishes. It is very unhappy. Restaurant is the place where many people relax and enjoy dining. Customers go to restaurant for the purpose of it. They should not be offended by smoking. Smoking should be strictly banned at the restaurant. However, some non-smokers may argue that they cannot enjoy eating in the restaurant if smoking is banned there. But restaurant is the special places. Smokers can smoke in private places, such as their home but customers can enjoy eating better than usual only at the restaurant. Non-smokers should be respected.",A2
"Now a days part time job is very important & necessary. Without part time job It is not easy to live comfortable. The income of single person is not sufficient to meet the requirement of whole family. So every one should work day and night to live in a good way. Students should do a part time job to decrease a financial burden on their parents. European countries always fast more develop that other countries because in that countries everyone should work, so one is sitting Idle. Students also work in those countries. In morning they go to their schools, colleges in the evening they do some part time job. So this way there is no burden of their parents. There is always some advantages & disadvantages of every thing. The disadvantage of part time job is that student can't study properly because they are too much tired daily work in school and colleges and in evening spend lot of energy in doing some job. So studies are more important in nowadays then every thing. But we should work hard to become financially strong if everyone should work than Pakistan run on the way of progress. And we'll be progressed.",B1
"Smoking should be banned at all hotels in the country. Smoking is a bad curse our country. Pakistan is a developing country but the curse of smoke has developed completely. Poor and rich both are found of smoking. Small children smoke. It is waste of money now a days young people do smoking a lot it is the cause of many decreases also which are very harm ful. It cause cancer, TB, and mouth diseases. It effects on the environment. It pollute the environment. In hotels the smoking trend is very usual which are effect very bad on students childrens and on other peoples. Other people irritate by other who are smoking. Smoking should be banned at hotels roads and whole country. The company industries who produce cigarette should be banned. The advertisement of the company should be banned. The heroes work in the advertisement should be banned. Sale of cigarette should be banned. Sale of cigarette to children is very bad. It should be stopped. In hotels smoking drinking is very usual which is very bad effect. We have to control this curse. We should work on this. Smoking is a bad curse and it should be stopped.",B1
"I strongly agree with the above statement for a number of obvious reasons. By now we all know the facts regarding second hand smoke and the health risk that it causes to others, especially children and babies. Smokers can no longer ignore the fact that by smoking around others, smokers or non-smokers alike, they are endangering everyone's health in that enclosed PUBLIC space. Restaurants and other enclosed public places should be accessible to anyone. By allowing people to smoke there, restaurant owners and smokers themselves are taking the rights of non smokers away. I believe that all people have the right to smoke and have no problem with that. Smokers can still smoke outside (though I do wish they were more careful about where they decided to throw out their cigarette butts!), in their homes, in their cars and in many other public areas. Many restaurants have smoking sections, but they are rarely adequately sectioned off from other areas in the restaurant and the smoke inevitably bothers other patrons. Smokers are becoming a minority with the trend for a healthier public environment on the rise, and it's about time that they realized, or rather that our government made them realize, that they can no longer put other people's health at risk for their own selfish pleasure.",C2
Part time job is the activity which a person performs a part from its major daily activites. part time job as most commonly seen in students. some other people are alsoinvolved inthis. students mainly involve in part time jobs to become independent and to fulfil their own needs. the want to be independent and desires not to become a load on their parents that's why tobecome finacialy andstable they adopt different part time jobs. A part from finaincial point of view a few of them are involved in this to get some kind of experience which would be helpful in their future life. lets take an example of a MBA student who is part time working in a bankor in a multinational company. then his expevience will be more precious then the salary he gets. his or her experince will aid him during whole his professional life. most popular part time jobs are teaching in an academy working in bank in evening in a multinational company. a part from students some professional people are also involved in part time jobs. they require more money to fulfil the needs of their family. the jobs they do could not give them much money so they spend extra time to get desives meet. I think it is a healthy activity because it helps to spend time in a good way.,B1
"Smoking is very traditional in my family. Ever since I was a little girl, my parents of have been smoking, and their parents and their parents before them were all smokers. Sometimes it makes me sad that I come from a family of such heavy smokers because all four of my grandparents died from lung cancer, and they died a relatively young age mostly in their early seventies. Even though they were kind of young when they died, the last years of their life was very bad and they did not have a very high quality of life. So in some ways, they really only lived like 50 or 60 years, and that is simply to shorten the time seeing as it is the age of modern science and medicine. I don't think that tobacco companies are doing a good enough job of explaining the harmful side effects of their products, and I don't think that governments are doing enough to restrict usage of tobacco in public places. Although I don't really know anything about Japan, I hope that they will ban smoking in restaurants so that no young people have to watch their relatives pass away in pain and agony.",C2
"I disagree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country. Firstly, it is not illegal to smoke cigarettes. These days the places allotted for cigarette smoking is being reduced all the time. Even smoking outside is banned in some areas leaving people who want a smoke with nowhere to go. Since smoking is an addiction and people are going to smoke one way or another, it is better to designate an area for people with similar tastes rather than to force them to take drastic measures. A restaurant that banned smoking would find cigarettes blocking up their bathroom toilets with the smell of smoke there as well. Since both non-smokers and smokers both use the bathroom there is a chance of losing the non-smoking patrons due to stinky bathrooms. Secondly, smoking is one of the last good population control tools legally permitted and actually advertized. With global warming and world over population and with the advances in medical technology, if we don't leave a few deadly vices for people to do themselves in with, we may find ourselves going to restaurants and not finding any food left. So build a wall, put in a glass partition and let the cool people have their smoked dinners.",C2
"Smoking is one of the activities that loved by the ones who like it, and hated by the ones who dislike it. For some people, smoking can relieve stress, especially when they smelling the smoke. Also, they feel like uncomfortable if they don't smoke for a long time. But, on the other side, smoking can be really annoying since the smoke polluted the surrounding air. This is why, most government banned smoking on some public places, like restaurant. And yes, I agree with this. There are some reasons why I agree with that. The first thing, the smoke can make other people feel uncomfortable. Why this is, I have already explained before. Also, inhaling smoke from smokers, known as passive smokers, is far more dangerous than if you smoke actively. Second, for the smokers itself, smoking can be dangerous for their health, as you've already knew. It can be from damaged lungs to the worst, death. Since the past, the disadvantages of smoking have already wide-spreading all around the world and the Internet. For conclusion, I strongly agree with statement that smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country. It makes other people feel uncomfortable and not good for health too.",B1
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time jog. There are some reasons that I think so. First, I think that we can experience various things through a part-time job that leads our life richer. And we can learn what is society. I think these experiences are useful for my future. These experiences will be useful for business. For example, I think that we will be able to know how to deal with the problem. Second, so college students are almost adult person, we should live a life of independence as we can. When we get a job we must live a life of independence, so I think that we should be used to be the type of life as soon as possible. And if we start to have a part-time job, we make our schedule by ourselves. I think that it is a very important thing to decide our plan. To control my life is a first step to be a nice adult person. Finally we make a new relation to make us better and the relation make our life more attractive. Because I think that to hear many other opinions grow us.",B1
"I think it is not that important for college students to have a part-time job. If a student has to earn money for himself, it is okay to have a part-time job. For example, if a student has to earn his tuition fee because his parents cannot afford it, then having a part-time job is inevitable. However, unless students have any reason to have a part-time job, I don't suggest or recommend them to work. In the first place, the most important task for college students is studying. If a student has a part-time job, he will spend his time working, which means he will lose his time to study. Having a part-time job is waste of time for students. Some people might say that having a part-time job gives students valuable experience that cannot be got from studying. It is not true, though. If students have a part-time job, they might lose more valuable opportunities that are helpful for them. If they don't spend their time on a part-time job, they can attend internships or social activities. It is better for college students to spend their time improving their capabilities by studying or attending other activities than having a part-time job.",B2
"I am strongly agree about Student to have a part time job is important because student the get money and I am disagree with college student to have a part job because disturb the other activity. The student have many necessary. Example student needs some necessary out days. And student help our parent too. necessary is our parent is very much. College student have in come money, so we are needs family condition. for college students to have a part time job. We are have cheer up about work hard. It is important for college students to have a part time job choose job is we are anything that can. And because if we have a part time job, we will get good job. And to reset a lot of money. When we have a part of job, we must seriously doing to work and we will learn to manage our time specifically student who has a tight schedule. They can study how to be business. It is not important for college student to have a part time job because disturb the other activity. Work to student only study. So we must focus in the study. So, we must to manage for time. Student don't needs a part time job because student really don't need a job. They don't burden to is with their job on their responsibility is study because the student should study.",A2
"I agree with this idea. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons why I think so. First, there are the facts that smoking is bad for our health and that side-stream smoke is more harmful than mainstream smoke. These facts mean that smoking is the problem not only for smokers themselves, but also for non-smokers. More specifically, non-smokers heavily suffer from smoking than smokers. Even if they try not to smoke, non-smokers suffer from harmful side-stream smoke, as long as they are near smoking people. Secondly, we have to think about what kind of place restaurants are, especially about the users. Many various people use restaurants, including little children, the old, the weak, and people who hate smoking. For such people, smoking is unbearable. As the result of the above, protecting non-smokers from side-stream smoke is the most important thing, and smokers should always care that there're many people who suffer from their smoking. My idea might sound strict with smokers. But as I know that there're some smokers who do want to smoke, I don't force them to stop smoking, because it's their own responsibilities to decide whether they smoke or not considering their health. If they do want to smoke, they have to choose a proper place to smoke. For example, they can go to a bar where they are allowed to smoke freely without being complained. In brief, we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country and smokers should always care about other people. But some places where we are allowed to smoke should be left for smokers. I believethat this is the best way how smokers and non-smokers can live together.",B1
"I think part-time jobs can be beneficial to students to understand the importance of saving and money. This is because people only realize the true nature of money when it is self-earned. They are more protective and stingy with money that they have spent effort and time to attain. This will help in personal financing, teaching them to be independent and managing their time. In addition, these part-time jobs provide learning experiences that instill soft skills in people which is useful for future careers such as interaction with others and communication. However, this is only true if the student is able to maintain their balance with their studies. Part-time jobs often take up a lot of time and require students to exhibit excellent time management. Without this, the students would lose out because ultimately, college provides the degree for them to succeed and progress in the future. Compromising studying for a part-time job would not be worth the potential career options that one might receive. In this case, it is more beneficial for the students to completely dedicate their time to college studies. Therefore, it is important for college students to prioritize their college studies over their part-time jobs which they should only take up if they are able to have a good work-college balance. ",B1
"Nowadays, there are many people like smoking, not only man but also woman. Some of them fell nice and relax by smoking and also can raise many ideas. But, in the fact, smoking isn't good for our healthy; it causes many risks, such as blindness, stroke, heart attacks, osteoporosis, and cancer. The risk is caused by the ingredients of cigarette. They really dangerous for our healthy. That's way, I agree if the government ban smoking in common area such as restaurant. There are many reasons for this opinion, first is to keep the nutrition and the sterilize of food in the restaurant, because the smoke of cigarette causes air pollution in the restaurant, so it make the air isn't comfortable and the customer will fell disappointed. The second reason is not all people like smoking. Then, the smoker must respect to the other who does not like smoking, because both of active smoker and passive smoker is worse effect of passive smoker. Passive smoker who only inhale of smoke cigarette. The third reason is to decrease the high level of risk smoking, because as we know smoking causes many risks and can shorten our life. In the fact, smoking is right of every one and it does not always have bad effect. Some of people said that they are smoking to raise an idea and exercise their brain in imagination or studying. More over, who is addicted by cigarette, of course he/she can't left smoking although at once or moment. So, the conclusion is the government must give certain place to smoker especially in common place.",B1
"I agree with doing part-time job when we are in university. I have many reasons for my idea, but I'll show you three of them this time. I think they are very important. First, part-time job gives us many friends. It is nice to have many friends. When we are sad, they cheer us. Especially when we have some trouble and we want my classmates not to know about it, my friends in office can help us. Second, we can earn money. Perhaps, we have been given money by our parents. However we will have to earn money by ourselves for the future. We must manage the money. So we should learn how to use money which we get by ourselves while we are students. Third we can experience working. Part-time job isn't full-time job; however we can know pleasure and pain which we get at work. Our employer may praise or scold us. My part-time job was cooking at the restraint. The other day I was forced to quit my job by my manager. Because I made many mistakes and I made the manager very angry. More over, I went to work only one day a week. So the manager told me that he wanted me to quit this job. I knew that it is severe to work. But this experience will be useful.",B1
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons about my opinion. Firstly, it is bad for us to smoke, though this is not only problem in the restaurants. And smoking does not only harm the smokers, but also harm the nonsmokers. I think that this is a strange story. Smoking not only harms the customers who come to a restaurant but also harms the workers who work on a restaurant. If we work on restaurant from morning till night everyday, the passive smoking will harm our health. Passive smoking is the act of breathing in smoke from other people's cigarettes. The passive smoking more harms our health than the active smoking. So if we make our health care hard, it may be bad for us to work on a restaurant. I think that we should keep our offices clean, when we consider the worker's health. Secondly, smoking makes the taste of a delicious meal bad. And smoking also spoils a cheerful mood of the meal. We do not come to enjoy at all for this. I had had a hot time with my friends, when I went to a restaurant with friends. But I got out of the restaurant, for I hated next customer to smoke. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"I agree that it is important for university students to have a part time job. One of the reasons for that is to broaden their horizons and gain other learning exposure apart from studying. Normally, university students have received 13-15 years of education before they enter the university. New-coming university students might have difficulty to gain access of other learning experience, such as job experience and social communication experience during their studying period in elementary or high school. However, with flexible learning environment in universities, students can take their initiatives to learn and experience apart from academic subjects And having part-time job is one of the ways for undergraduates to equip themselves with other experience. Therefore, in students' point of view, having part-time job is essential to attain all-round development in universities. Not only having part-time job can help students gain other learning exposure, but can help students bridge the gap from purely receiving education to actively participating in the society. The transition of the two phases is seemingly apparent and important with the increase in undergraduates in tertiary education. However, career guidance in high school education curriculum is often neglected because of tight academic schedules. In order to make a successful transition, having part-time job is crucial in the university study path. Through taking part-time jobs, students can find their potentials and working concentrations, which are useful information in preparing the career planning right after the graduation. Hence, it is important for students to take part time job. To conclude, taking part-time job in university study path is important as students can learn other experience and equip themselves with different skills to have all-round development. Besides, part-time job can help students to bridge the social gap so that they can make preparation in career planning in the future.",B1
"College students should have a part time job. In my opinion, a part time job is good for college students because of these reasons. First, students can get a lot of direct experience from a part time job by themselves because they cannot get this experience from the class room for sure!!! Second, it can increase responsibility in their life and their job. For example, they must get up and go to the job on time, take care of themselves, divide their time, manage their expenses. Third, student can mitigate their parent because they can earn some money from their job. For example, they do not ask for money from their parent when they want to buy something because they can use the money that they earn from the job. Moreover, the students that have a part time job can be aware of the valuable of money that they earn with their strength and be aware of saving the money. The last reasons is to get wise to adapt themselves to get along with the colleague. Adapting themselves is very important for the living, for example, if they do not have adapting themselves, they cannot work together or get along with friends, colleague, and someone else. All in all, the part time job is good for college student in a lot of way.",B1
"I believe that smokers should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers have the right to smoke when and where they want. However the right should be limited in the range of not harming other people. Every human beings have rights to do what they want to do. However, if they all insist just their rights, there will be a lot of conflicts because some rights may be harmful to some groups of people. So the criterion for regulating the rights should be in the range of not annoying other people. For example, there are some places such as coffee shops or internet cafÃ© that offer separate room for non-smokers or smokers only. This policy can guarantee all people's right to smoke and right no to smell smoke. Only in this case, smokers should be able to smoke in restaurants. Smoking is not only annoying non-smokers by its smell, but also it is very bad for our health. It is also proven that there is more harmful effect for people who breathe in the smoke than people who actually smoke. So smokers are kind of killing people by giving off the smoke. In conclusion, I strongly believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants for bad smell and harmful effects to our health.",B2
"Firstly, I totally agree with the point. As we all know, smoking is a bad habit. Is there any advantages of smoking can be shown? The answer is obvious No. Therefore, smoking should completely banned at all the public place, especially in the restanrants. Secondly, let's analyse the disadvantages to the people who are sitting or standing around the smokers. If a person who are smoking, it is not avoid letting the seconghand smoking happen. It is very uncomfortable to inhale the smoke of a cigarette smoker. The restaurant is a limited room. When we are together with a smoker who are smoking, the smoke he exhales fills our lungs and also makes our eyes water. We are not smoker, but we are force to breath smoke-filled air. It is unfair to us. So, smoking in public should be banned altogether, and the restaurant was included. We know that breathing smoke regularly, as in cigarette and other tobacco smoking, leads to increased rates of lung cancer in a dose dependent manner. It was said by the expert that tobacco smoke including secondhand smoke may also contribute to non-lung cancers more than preriously thought. Finally, for the sake of everybody's health, I suggest that smoking should complete banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Going through college, or university, is a time of learning and the student should be whole-heartedly focused on the acquisition of knowledge and of gaining relevant skills for the working world. However, this does not have to be achieved through students taking up part-time jobs outside of curriculum time in university. Universities offer students many opportunities such as internships, courses and workshops, directly and indirectly, for them to have a glimpse of the working world and to gain skills about how best to carry themselves in the working world. Hence, a part-time job would not be as important in this context as the students would not require a part-time job to gain experience about the working world. Some may argue that a part-time job is important for students to earn some pocket money during their university or college years so they will be less of a burden to their parents who have to help pay for their education. I believe that this is true, and that college students should try their best to help lessen the burden on their parents. However, there are ways that this can be done without compromising the student's education on a part-time job. For example, the student can earn a decent amount of money during internships. This can help to pay for their daily expenses, lessening their parents' burden, and students will also learn a great deal during the internships, more than when they are just taking up a job, as internships require students to work closely with the employers, and also allows them to create networks that would serve important in future.

"I think it is a good regulation that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, there are pros and cons for smoking. However, there is only one advantage comes into my mind. People who smoke will trigger chemical reaction in their brain which makes them feel good, happy, and comfortable, but they will have to get more cigarettes to achieve the same level of happiness. Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulted from smoking is health damage. Smoking destroys people's lungs. Smokers can't breathe as well as normal ones. They can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life qualities, too. Besides, smoking increase the risk of suffering from cancer. What's worse, smoking has great impact on both smokers and people around those smokers. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it does not only influence others at that time but also people who come in the future. Because those furniture and walls may absorb the bad things come from the cigarettes, and then impact future customers. Thus, I think smoking ought to be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I think I should have a part time job. By the way, I am a college student, so this essay is on topic. Just in case you are wondering. This is important to me because I can get money. Money is generally important to a person because with money you can buy many good things, like food, clothes, houses, can go on holidays, and most importantly can find a wife. With a part time job, you can get experience in the working life, which is always important because experience is important in finding future part time jobs. This is circular logic. And therefore it is illogical. I realise that I just made a grammatical error there as I started a sentence with the word and. ""And"" cannot be used to start a sentence unless the sentence starts like this one, where and is not used in its usual sense. The correct use of the word ""and"" is used this way, in that part time job and jobs are both types of work. That is a correct use of the word. When I grow up, I want to get a part time job as a English tutor so that I can teach young kids grammar such as whatever I wrote above. I hope this essay is humourous and that you laugh. ",B1
"ï¼©don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays, almost all of restaurants in Japan have two different seats. One is a seat for non-smokers, the other is a seat for smokers. When you go to a restaurant, a waiter surely ask you whether you smoke or not. So if you don't smoke or you hate the smoke from a smokers, you had better choose a seat for non smokers. However, in case that you don't smoke but your husband or your friends smoke, they may choose a seat for smokers and you may put up with smoke from their. In that case, you should not put up with. You must say that you want to take a seat for non-smokers. If smoking completely banned at all the restaurants, people who are like smoking not willing to go to a restaurant. So not completely ban smoking, every restaurants should be careful about environment of restaurants. For example, put plants that keep the air fresh, or clean the air sometimes etc. It is important for restaurant to keep the environment of restaurants clean. And it is important for people who go to a restaurant to say whether you want to smoke or not. From these reasons, I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I agree that students should have a part-time job. A part-time job is becoming necessary in student's life. However, Most college students in Thailand don't have a part-time job.

The part-time job will give them much benefit such as experience, co-workers, ability to learn new skills. They will have the basic which make a good employee. They will better prepare themselves for the future. I believe that the students who work are more confident better time-management skills than students who aren't not employed. Working teaches them about responsibility too. Moreover, the college students who have a part-time job can find extra money. They needn't annoy their parents. However, those students can lead to drop out or have low grades. And working can also limit opportunities to build friendships and emotional development. Someone tells the college students should spend time on homework, studies, activities. Besides money which they find will use up with cars, gas and luxurious items because they have money to spend, they feel that they deserve to spend it. However, I still agree that students should have a part-time job. The problems don't happen if they have responsible.",B1
"I know smokers often enjoy their smoking after eating, but I think they have to go out of the restaurant when they are smoking. First of all, if someone smells smoking while he or she is eating, it can be very unpleasant experience to him or her. Because people also feel the taste through the nose, if they smell smoking, their eating will be greatly interrupted. I have similar experience before, and it is extremely terrible. Secondly, smokers always have to consider non-smokers. Smokers can smoke in other place, but non-smoker can not avoid when smokers are smoking nearby them. Thirdly, already smoking is banned at many places, like bus stops or subway station. Restaurants are also one of the public places, so smoking can be tolerated at the restaurants. Finally, smoking can be harmful to food. Indirectly smoking is even more dangerous than directly smoking. If the food is made while somebody is smoking near the food, it can harm people who eat the food, especially when they are non-smoker. That's why smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"In the context of Singapore, it is a good experience for college students to have a part time job, but it is not important - unless, the student happens to be from a lower income family with difficulties paying for school fees. Engaging in a part time job will give one more exposure of the industry. Students interested to pursue a career in a particular industry can hold a part time job in that particular industry to gain more experience and apply what he/she is learning in school to work. It can help the student figure out whether he/she really wants to pursue a career in that industry after graduation. However, in the context of Singapore, most universities degree makes internships compulsory. Students will be exposed to the industry during the academic life sooner or later. To have a part time job in the specific industry is therefore, not important. Yet, one's family and financial background needs to be considered. Not everyone can afford school fees and sometimes government subsidies are still not enough. For students from lower income family who might require to take a bank loan to pay for school fees, securing a part time job would be important, to help the family cope with living expenses. ",B1
"I agree to great extent that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Singapore. As there is non-smoker using the same vicinity together with the smokers, everyone should be mindful on their shared spaces so that there is no disturbance causes to the people around. Smoking in places such as restaurants could pollute the air quality, which could causes uncomfortable experience to other users nearby. For instance, the effect of smoking restaurant which are mainly air-conditioned space, it would tap the exhaust smoke from the smokers within the restaurant which give off unpleasant smells. This could affect those people who could possibility find it uncomfortable to be in a restaurants that fills with the smell of smoking. Nonetheless, it creates unhappiness of non-smokers about the restaurant's environment and the dining experience will be greatly affected. There had been measures taken to manage this issues by the government, as they activity encourage smokers to smoke only at designated areas of the coffee shop or shopping malls. Therefore, this effort helps to reducing the contact between non-smokers and smokers. Hence, it has creates a better air quality within shops and public spaces. However, it might have causes difficulties to smokers to smoke freely in anywhere they would wanted. In conclusion, we have to strive for a balance society whereby smoker and non-smokers could harmoniously enjoy the use of common space such as restaurants. By providing specific venue for smoking and encourage understanding from smokers to accept the changes, thus it would build better air quality in our restaurants. ",B1

"I am strongly agree. Because smoking will do you and people in the restaurants bad healthy. Besides inside the restaurant have bad smell. When a lot of people in the restaurant receive bad smell, it was done yours bad healthy. Perhaps I think, should have regulation for restaurant. Or when have person smoking in the restaurant, the owner fine person. And smoking has pollution in the restaurant. Cigarette was done people bad healthy. The owner of the restaurants should put a big sign in front of the restaurants that no smoking in this place. If all the restaurant bane smoking, it reduce people to smoke because no one welcome. I go to the restaurant and someone smoke, I ask him to stop smoking and he ignore so I ask the owner to change my table. I still smell the cigarettes so I ask them to check my table and I go out. If the restaurants don't allow smokers, they won't lost a customer who don't like smoking. Smoking make people have lung cancer and mouth cancer. It's very suffering when dying. I see many pictures about people who have cancer from smoking. It's very dangerous and disgusting. I really hope that it will be completely banned soon.",A2
"Recently in this century, part time jobs have become popular among the teenagers. Now in Pakistan and in other countries teenagers get dependent in their early teenage with the consent of their parents, aided by the opportunities available of the part time jobs. These are basically those jobs which are performed after study hours and shouldn't be mixed up with child labor. To some extent these have helped to boast up the economy of a country. People got a larger and wider range of people and companies to interact that way. It also lessens the percentage of dependent population which is indeed a great obstacle in the development of a country. Part time jobs have also played a vital role in the well grooming and building of great decision power in the young ones. Youngsters learn a lot about life by the practical experience through the part time job. Part time jobs have also eliminated the problem of unemployment in the society. Also dependency of children on their parent decreases and it also lowers the burden of parents. They have enabled people to find out their real talent of work and yet have made every country stable economically by allowing people to work.",B1
"Smoking is very dangerous for our health. There are only disadvantages of smoking I can find. I can't find any single advantage of smoking. Well, smokers will tell us lots of benefits of smoking. Some of them are smoking makes you relax, smoking reduces stress etc. . . In the whole world, there are lots of smoking people. They tend to smoke whenever they want, wherever they can. This pattern of behavior appears even in a restaurant. Regardless of what the reason maybe, restaurant is the place where many people enjoy food and talk with their important person. Such place especially a restaurant; smoking should be banned at all in the country. There are lots of non-smokers as the number of smokers. Smokers have right to smoke whenever they want, but non-smokers have right to get clean air. In addition to this point, a restaurant is sensitive place since there is food area. If the nicotine which is contained in cigarettes infiltrates food, non smokers are exposed to bad effects of smoking such as carbon dioxide or other chemicals. Consequently, non smokers are indirect damaged from smoker's interoperated smoking. So for minimizing these losses, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1

"I disagree because college is a lot more difficult than people realize and to graduate is even more difficult than it was just a few short years ago. If students are working in part-time jobs because they need to survive or pay college fees, then that's understandable. If there is no need to pay, then I would say don't work because college is hard enough as it is without adding impossible schedules, heavy workloads or other obligations that only serve to suck up more and more of your time and give you a bucketful of stress. So many of my buddies have held down jobs while attending college and all of them have their own little horror stories to tell. College is a big enough undertaking on its own these days and the pressure to graduate is always on. Leave well enough alone I think and just keep concentrating on your college stuff without adding to it. It's not compulsory unless as I said, you need the money or it might be a short internship which is a different story because you usually do those during your vacation times and they are not some extra curricular activity that sucks up your time and patience.",C2
"Part time job is one of the skills every college students needs before getting a job. It is like a training for every college student who is about to embark on their future careers. It is also a source of income for those independent students, for those who pay for their tuition or for those who want to have extra allowances. Having a part time job also has its pros and cons but it is still based on the person taking it. Maybe, for him it's difficult but for other people they enjoy every minute of it. People will never be what they seem; it will always surprise you on what they can really do in life. When you have a part time job, you earn extra money and extra money. When you have extra money no one will stop you in buying whatever you want. Whether it's a Christian Dior dress or a Louis Vuitton bag, no one's stopping you in buying those things since the money is yours and you have the right to spend it on anything you want. People may think you're a spender but when you earn something by yourself and buy the things you want, you feel ecstatic, excited, happy and proud for yourself. But getting a part time job depends on whether you are busy with school projects or not, of course, studies are our first priority when it comes to school. It teaches us how to prioritize our time management because we do part time jobs for additional allowances or for money but study will always comes first for every college students around the world with part time jobs.",B2
"Smoking and breathing the smoke are bad for our health. When someone smokes, people around him breathe the smoke. If it occurred at the restaurant, the smoke would prevent them from enjoying meal because they don't feel the smell and the taste very well. Moreover, they may feel uncomfortable. In case of me, I hate tobacco and the smoke. When my parents smoke during my meal, I feel uncomfortable. I get them not to smoke while I eat meal. At the restaurant, I make it a rule to choice the no smoking area. However, when no smoking area is full, I sit the smoking area unwillingly. Then I can't enjoy meal. I go to the restaurant to enjoy meal. I want to eat at home rather than eating meal at the smoking area. The smoke not only prevent enjoying meal but also is bad for our health. Smoking people don't have a right to prevent enjoying meal and influence the other people's health. They should consider the environment and people around them. If they did so, they would realize that they should not smoke at the restaurant. If the restaurant banned smoking, people who are like me enjoy meal. So, smoking should be banned at the restaurant.",B1
"Nowadays, part time job play a big role in college students life. I firmly think that it is essential to do part time job for us college students. To begin with, it can enlarge our horizon that we do a part time. When we communicate with social people in the work, not only can we learn a lot of technique skills, but we can also get to know more information from the society, which we can not learn in our school. On the other hand, we almost learn all of our knowledge in the class but have not put it into exercise. It is part time job that can teach us to us use the knowledge more effectively in our life. Last but not least, doing a job can make us aware of how to earn money and how hard it is to earn even one cent. Doing a job will cultivate our economical life style, which will leave a deep impression to us who have been taken care of since we were babies. To sum up, even if part time job may be hard to us, it is a perfect way to make us mature and close to the society.",B1
"College life is a very critical period of life in the life of a student. Because the studies becomes somewhat more hard with the start of college life. The routine of students becomes tough due to the burden of studies, because the syllabus increases as well as becomes tough. So, studies need a lot of time. Therefore at this stage part time jobs are not essential for students. But the students which have to face financial crises should support their parents, if they have abilities and they can manage. But if the students could not manage they think that they are not doing their best in the studies. They should not do part time jobs. Because the only thing that parents demand is the best performance of their child in studies. So, we should prefer studies more than anything. The extraordinary students, if they can manage should help their parent in the financial matters. But if they think that their studies are being effected, they do not do this. Whole of the future of the student is based on his performance in studies. There are a lot of reasons due to which students do the part time job i-e for the support of their parents. Some people do part time jobs to keep themselves busy independent. inshort the matter of doing part time jobs depend upon the abilities of student.",B1

"I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several reasons to prove it as below I mentioned. First of all, keep up with the world's current, there are many country set the law that people can't smoke in the public area, of course including restaurant. And the health tax of the cigarette is high than before. Take me for example, my father used to smoke every day, so the expense he spend on buying cigarette, I can buy many things. Second, smoking is harmful to our body. There are some medical reports indicate that smoking will hurt people's lung. It harm to people not only on smoking person, but on people who inhale second-hand smoke. Last but not least, smoking in the restaurant affects atmosphere of eating food. Maybe the food is delicious and smells good. But after inhaling second-hand smoke, and these food's flavor may cover by smoke. Some restaurant would set a smoking area to customers who need to smoke. However, I think this is useless way to separate two kind customers. Though they set specific area, I still can smell the cigarette's smell. To sum up, smoking had many drawbacks, it is not only spend money, but also harm to our body. In this topic, the smoker smoke in the restaurant will affect other customer's mood, what's worse, they may let other people to inhale second-hand smoke and harm to body. Therefore, I do agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.",B1
"Lots of problems exist in part time job. I would like to discuss low wage, behavior of superior, and no break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea the time I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress when I was at work the manager treated me bad he swore at me and shouted at me in front of people, At the work break time was not guaranteed if the manager see me moving slowly he told me to walk faster or to run, of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid in proper date. Behavior of manager or superior at the work in work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case as I said. Manager used to swore at part time job workers. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible because part time job workers has personality too they do not deserve that my onion is relationship between part time job worker and superior should be improved for good.

"It Is Important for College Students to Have a Part-time Job. Nowadays, the capability in finishing work effectively and perfectly has become one of the most important things when the company measure students' ability. Taking a part-time job is a good chance to improve our skill, enrich our experiences and enlarge our horizon. Fist of all, having a part-time job can help us reduce the heavy burden that our parents taken. It will make us understand the hardship that making money is a not easy thing better.

"I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout Japan. I have three reasons to support my position. Firstly, regarding the health of customers, more and more compelling evidence suggests that the ingestion of second-hand smoke is a direct cause of various lung disorders, predominant of which is lung cancer. Any steps that can be taken to reduce this risk should be taken by any civilized nation. Japan is by and large a socialist nation, where the good of the many is the concern of the individual; sickness and lack of public health simply undermines the health of the body-politic, which is illogical and self-defeating. Secondly, regarding the health of restaurant staff, second-hand smoke creates an unhealthy working environment. I believe that every individual has the right to work in a safe and healthy work-place. Banning smoking will remove the dangers inherent to second-hand smoke from negatively effecting employees. Finally, there is the issue of social acceptance of smoking, or rather lack thereof. A restaurant, or restaurant chain, that bans smoking on its premises sends out a message to society in general: that smoking is unacceptable in the presence of non-smokers, of whom there are more and more in the light of recent shifts in medical awareness and social health. Therefore, for these reasons, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.",C2
"To achieve a milestone of having a smoke-free environment and a healthier population, the country has imposed bans on several public places, including restaurants. Smokers are only allowed to smoke at demarcated areas in some restaurants where it would be prohibited elsewhere within the restaurant premises. Most restaurants also ban smoking within their entire premises. This is considerably attributed to take into consideration the non-smokers who would not appreciate, feel unpleasant or even be irritated at the presence of cigarette smoke while they are consuming food and/or beverages in the restaurant. Besides being a health hazard, smoking in the restaurant could also pose a hygiene hazard if the food or beverage is contaminated with cigarette content while being consumed, even if the consumer is not smoking. Restaurants may not be willing to impose a smoking ban (unless the authorities say so) because it may drive some of their customers away from patronising them, since the smokers may be able to find alternatives where smoking is allowed within the premises (or a certain portion thereof). These will discourage restaurants from imposing a smoking ban, and instead encourage restaurants who allow smoking with potentially more customers. To really discourage smokers from smoking, smoking bans should become more stringent to include all restaurants in the country banning smoking. This should actually encourage smokers to quit smoking, instead of being succumbed to temptation by finding another spot where they are actually allowed to smoke. Eventually the country should aim for its people to lead a healthy lifestyle, which should have been the real purpose of banning smoking in so many public places. ",B1

"Whether are not smoking should be banned at Japanese restaurants should be decided by the people who it affects most, the Japanese. Nonetheless, I feel that I can offer some perspectives on the situation which may not already have been brought up. I am sure that everyone else is writing about how smoking is bad for people and how it is rude to these people and the restaurants staff to smoke at restaurants. What some people may have not considered, however, is that when it comes to the end of the day, many smokers are really not in control of their smoking habit. This is to say that nicotine is so addictive that these people literally cannot control their behavior. There is also a strong emotional connection to having something in the mouth, which comes from our time as babies. This is why so many smokers are successful in quitting by chewing gum, using toothpicks, or chewing sunflower seeds. All of these can serve as good replacements for the feeling of having something in your mouth, and so I feel that more than banning smoking in restaurants, there should be more opportunities for smokers to quit smoking effectively. This solution stands to solve the entire problem of smoking and not only the problem of the nuisance in restaurants.",C2
"It is often said that smoking is not good for your health. Do you agree or disagree with this? Indeed, smoking causes many kinds of diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease. Because of tobacco-related illness, around 5 million people die each year. Judging from this, we can say tobacco is very dangerous for our health. Moreover tobacco is harmful not only for the very person smoking cigarettes but also for those who are around there. So these days, a lot of countries are beginning to prohibit smoking. Similarly in Japan, elementary school and junior high school began to ban smoking in their ground, and most of the public places don't allow people to smoke. But not all the restaurants in the country, where plenty of customers visit every day, ban smoking. It is not reasonable that smoking is not banned at all the restaurants. Restaurants are the places where various kinds of people gather, of course including those who don't smoke. So it is natural to consider if you smoke a cigarette at the restaurant, it troubles no-smokers around you. In the first place, a restaurant is a place where people enjoy meal, not in the least people feel displeasure. We cannot find any advantages to allow people to smoke cigarettes at the restaurants. In conclusion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"In the perfect situation, smoking policy would be set by bar or restaurant owners, and customers would patronize the establishments with the policy they prefer. There are two kinds of restaurant room. Smoker room and non-smoker room. When the government starts telling restaurant owners what their customers can and cannot do, the government is overstepping its boundaries So, for any body is not smoker, they can enjoy in the special room that different with smoker room. There is another argument rages over the effects of smoking on public health. But in other hand, smoking tobacco is not illegal act, yet the 25 percent of Americans who do smoke are often treated as if they was criminals. They are incessantly nagged, blamed for numerous illnesses and unpleasantries, and made to feel guilty by self-righteous non-smokers. So, banning smoking in all public restaurant violates principle and jeopardizes our freedom. Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. A ban on smoking imposes unnecessary governmental interference in private business, affects business owners negatively, and discriminates against smokers. However, smokers in the restaurant must choose the smoking area so that they will not harm the other customers who do not smoke and need the clean-air environment.",B1
"I think that college people have to have a part-time job, but they have it for vacation only. Because most of student are using parents money usually. I mean parents invest money for our future or dream. Therefore, in the vacation, we make A pocket money for rewarding a favor. Of course, if your parents don't pay tuition financially, you have to have a part-time job in the term-time. But if you are not in that situation, I would like to recommend concentrating study in the term-time. If we don't focus on studying, We would not have a good grade. After all, we don't have a good job. It is not good way. It just recycles the bed situation. It is not only way to make a money. For instance, you study hard in the term-time; you will get scholarship from university. And, you can have a part-time job for weekend. And your routine life, you save money. Don't waste your money. I mean that the part-time job doesn't disturb your future or dream and many ways is exist to reduce a pressure for your parents. After all, in my opinion, college student's part time job is an option for vacation. If you have a worrisome for parents, you have to take a good job, and pay back parent's investment. In the term-time, college student have a right to study hard.",B1
"Part time job is becoming the need of the peoples because of the raising prices of every thing which is needed to a human.

In our country man is supposed to fulfill the needs of his family, and it is commonly observed that if there is five to six members in a family there is only one person who is working to fulfill the needs of whole family, so it is not easy to a person who have salary ten to fifteen thousand to fulfill the basic needs of his family members with out having a part time job. On the other hand students also do it, to pay there fee and to manage their selves. Part time job affects a lot. Part time job is need based. It is physically and mentally extortion.

"I think that smoking should not be banned at all restaurants in Japan. Of course, a lot of studies show that smoking is harmful not only for smokers, but also the people around smokers. Smoking causes the lung cancer; it almost becomes a commonsense. However, many smokers continue to smoking although they know the commonsense. A study shows that otherwise once a person is used to smoking, it is difficult that he gives up smoking, smoking help smokers concentrate on their works, or make smokers feel relax. These effects make it more difficult for smokers to give it up. Restaurants are the places where people feel comfortable and relax through the dishes. If smoking is banned at all restaurants, those who make it a rule to smoke a cigarette after eating will feel uncomfortable. The owners who manage restraints should not make them feel such uncomfortable feelings and they will not. This is why I insist that smoking should not be banned at restaurants. On the other side, it is also important that those who don't smoke should not feel uncomfortable because of smokers. The owners should make effort as well as they can. If it becomes true, more people have more comfortable and better times.",B1

"I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons and the first one is concerned with economic situation. That is, these days the college fee is very high in Korea, so there are some students who had to stop their study regardless of their intention. Of course, students can take a scholarship but it is available for a few students. Therefore, to cover their school fee, college students have to have a part-time job. In fact, many college students are doing a part-time job such as private tutoring and serving in the restaurant after school. The second reason is that although taking a part-time job looks like a kind of obligation, it can enrich students' life. As a college student, it is important to concentrate on their major and study. However, I think that experiencing diverse things is one of the college students' duties and taking a part time job can be one valuable experience. For example, if there is a college student who wants to be a teacher, he or she can consider whether the dream is right for him or her by doing private tutoring. On the other hand, although a student is doing a part time job that is not related with his or her dream, he or she can find what he or she really wants as doing it.",B2
"I agree this statement. First, having a part-time job gives us, college students, chances. The chances are for us learning money is very difficult and hard. Much of us would not think that getting money is so hard things. Becouse often we could get money from some relatives easily. Renently I have heard that a lot of new members of society would retire their company soon. It seems to me that one of the couses is that they did not spend their school days om working. If I would not experience working in my school days, I will be confused the hardness of reciving money in future. Second, although it is my individual things, I have a lot of things that I want to do. For example, trip with my friend, learning cooking and getting drivers license. But those need so much money for me. So, I should have a part-time job and I want to use the money that I earned for me. Finaly, we have much free time. Probably, it is only college student to have so much free time. So we should use the time effectively. I think that one of the means of spending the time on part-time job is so good. That is why I agree the opinion.",B1
"I agree that college students should have a part-time job. Firstly, college should venture out into the workforce to gain some work experience. The events in the school compound differ from those in the workforce. Hence, it is important for the college students to pick up necessary skills to prepare them for the future. For those working in the frontline areas such as promoting items or the service counter, we learn to interact with customers and pick up effective relation skills. Moreover, for those working in the backroom, we are able to see how a company functions and also are given opportunities to participate in some project tasks. Secondly, taking a part-time job translates to more income for the college students. We realise that money is hard earned and hence learn to save up for rainy days and spend our money wisely. Not only that, the college students realise that there is no free lunch and so they are motivated to work harder in their studies. It can also act as extra finance if the college students want to further their studies in the future. Thus, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. ",B1
" I agree to this opinion. We all know smoking is harmful to our health and it is a bad habit. I think smoking ban heart gains massive. The follows are advantages of smoking bans. The first, Bans on smoking in restaurants have had a bigger impact on preventing heart attacks than ever expected, data shows. Therefore, there are many good things bans on smoking in public place. In China, there have a word; children are the future of the country. However, Children exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke have an increased risk of development in adulthood, even if they never smoked. This is very dangerous to our children. So in my view of opinion, we must take a measure to smoking ban on public place. I think every Chinese knows many people are dead in heart attack and lung cancer in our country, this is cause to secondhand cigarette smoke. Though we are not smoking, secondhand cigarette smoke have a big harmful to our body. Now, many countries have law about smoking bans. Many studies add to the growing evidence that a ban on smoking in public places seems to have a positive impact on heart attack rates, which is clearly good news for our nation's heart health. Nevertheless, the statistics also shows how quickly the benefits can be felt after a smoking ban is implemented and indicate how dangerous second-hand smoke can be to the heart. I think it is a good idea to ban smoking in all restaurants in the country, everyone will support this bans.",B1
"It is a new trend that smoke should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I reckon the idea of no smoking in any restaurant a great one. As we know, there has been so many non-government organizations working hard, trying to tell people the damage caused by smoking. Smokers are addicted, and those people who smoke can have serious lung problems or any related diseases. These health problems may not only kill a person, but also ruin a whole family as there have been countless people and families suffering from those disasters. What's more, it is not just the people who smoke can be harmed physically by the cigarette. Those who don't smoke, non-smokers, may also have lung problems just because they breathe in the smoke exhausted by the smokers near by. As smoking can hurt people in both physical and mental ways, it should be banned in public areas, such as restaurants, around the country. Even if there is merely one person smoking, the damage may hurt everyone in the area. In a modern society, people have rights to decide what they want and the rights to say no. That is, we can't protect the non-smokers or guarantee them that no harms will be done when we are living in an environment where others are smoking; therefore, banning this harmful behavior is absolutely the right thing to do.",B1
"In my opinion. I agree for college students to have a part-time job. Because they will have income and they make their free time benefit. They drill to take time out for future. They have a lot of experiences from working. They help parent for subside expenditure. At present economy is bad so people fight for good life. Life is a struggle for existence they said. And a job is really hard to find for work. Many people have no jobs to work, they are very poor. Some of them are very old and no one want them to work. But for students, we strong so many jobs want us to do. we can do everything and we can do very long. A part-time job have many profit. Such as they have much money, they meet friends, who like a same thing, they get a new experience, and they have new friends. In the future the college students have to have a part-time job everybody. Because a thing is more expensive. Such as cars, homes, computer, mobile phone, cereal, food. Cause there's a famine in the world. People fight for food and drink. Most people is nutrition deficiency. So the college students to have a part-time job for future.",B1
" NO SMOKING, you can almost see it everywhere. As the technology develops smoking has been hated by more and more people. It has not been a simple of fashion but a enemy. Smoking is bad to your health, which I need not say. However, many people agree this point. But they have another idea that just smoke once will not make a big different to their health. I have to say that is true. But if you smoke once everyday, or even every half day, it can destroy your body easily and many people can not stop when they have smoked once. Keep away from cigarettes is not very hard if you have not smoked. But it is not easy to do so if you have smoked for a long time. But I hope that they can control themselves because it will also be bad for other people who do not smoke. Even they do not care about themselves, for other people, they should stop smoking. Wherever you are, smoking is not a good thing. Not only for yourself, but also for other people. I believe you can get a strong body and more friends if you do not smoke.",A2
"Most people believe that it is the performance of those college students which is more vital than any other aspects. However, this opinion is now being questioned by more and more enterprises and experts, who complain that the graduates can barely do anything when they start to work. Those skeptics pay more and more attention on considering working experience of their interviewees. I agree to those skeptics' opinion that it's quite necessary for college students to have a part-time job. As it is known to all, college in China has offer students a circumstance with rather strict rules and schedule. That means, we will get more part-time and most of us will spent part time on playing, as a consequence, we will learn less and less, even not enough to feed ourselves after graduation. In addition, especially for those who want to have further study, those best commercial colleges in the world treasure working experience most. It is quite hard to get their offers, even ads, without enough working experience. For us, college students, who can hardly get regular jobs, part-time jobs become our best choice for that taking part-time jobs can we gain both working experiences and allowance. While the disadvantages can certainly not be ignored, taking a part-time job sometimes would occupy our classes and rest time. It will inevitably influence our performance. But compared to the benefits it brings, these disadvantages can be ignored. And we also can fix it by self-study and making a reasonable schedule. It would seem self-evident that it is becoming more and more important for college students to take a part-time job. Taking a part-time job graduates can not only easily integrate into our society but also more competitive to beat others to get offers to further study.",B1
"Recently, in Japan many people got to know the risk and unnecessariness of smoking in society. Thus, I think it is necessary to ban from smoking at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, smell of dishes-sweet smell, sour smell and so on- is very important in restaurants. And the cigarette spoils a smell of the cooking. It is true that there is some person who wants to smoke while eating a dish or drinking liquor, but the smoking should be prohibited at the restaurant if we think about many other people. Secondly, the smoke of the cigarette may spoil equipment: for example, wallpaper or ornament in the restaurant. It is very wasteful if these things are very precious valuable things. Thirdly, the prohibition of smoking is a flow of the modern society. It becomes natural on a train and the platform. Or there are many places that you cannot smoke in the workplace. So it is thought that it is a matter of course to prohibit smoking at a restaurant. In conclusion, the smoking should be banned in all Japanese restaurants.",A2
"I can not agree more that smoking should be completely forbidden at all the restaurants in this country. First of all, smoking does not only harm the heath of smokers but also affects people around the smokers, especially for pregnant women, children and the elderly. Smoking has been causally linked to cancer, heart and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, passive smoking has been associated with lung cancers, allergies, eyes and skin diseases and so on. Restaurants usually have an enclosed environment where the air is not fresh; smoking will bring more damage to consumers' health. Secondly, smoking is usually considered as a potential cause for fire. Poorly placed cigarettes are very likely to start a fire in a restaurant where many of the furniture are inflammable. On the other hand, as most of the restaurants are equipped with fire alarms. Smoking will trigger fire alarms and will cause problems for the other consumers and the workers in a restaurant. Lastly, smoking are gradually considered as a bad habit and banned in most public places, such as airport, MRT and schools. Even though the restaurants are supposed to be places where people consume foods and get relaxed, there are non-smokers than smokers and it would surely benefit the smokers a lot if smoking are banned in the restaurants.

" Part-time job is a new kind of working method suited for those students who don't have enough time to take a full-time job. A part-time job can provide the students with the study and living expense they need as well as plentiful working experience. But it doesn't mean that everyone has a must to do a part-time job. It depends on one's situation. In my opinion, a student should know what he or she is doing and going to do in the whole life, and value the advantages and disadvantages when making decisions. If a student is having challenge in paying the tuition fee, doing a part-time job is a must. Otherwise he cannot continue his education. Well, if a student is not poor and he doesn't have a lot of pressure in study, he can have much spare time to manage. In this situation, doing a part-time job is still a good choice than playing computer games in dormitory. So part-time job is also good for the students who have a lot of spare time and don't want to be so relaxed, it can help students gain work experience and fasten their steps to the society. But if a student has to study a lot in college, he must treasure his time. It's unwise to do part-time job using the limited time and eventually interrupted the study. So, in conclusion, different cases should be analyzed independently. Part-time job is suitable for many people who face economic problems or have abundant spare time, but not for those who are busying furthering their studies.",B1
"When you are enjoying a meal in a restaurant, the man who sits near you is smoking, would you feel have no interest in enjoying the delicious food and think the man is very tiresome. I don't know your answer, but I know when this happen to me, I would. I think it is a very bad behavior to smoking in public places, especially in restaurant, First, when one is smoking, other people besides him is also harmed by the secondhand smoke. As we know, secondhand smoke is worse for our health. Especially for women and children, they are affected more deeply. Many diseases are caused by smoke and secondhand smoke, this fact can't be ignored. Second, smokings in a restaurant makes many guests can't enjoy their meals, many people who don't smoke dislike smoking smell. Like me, when I smell smoke, I fell uncomfortable. When I come into a place filled with smoke, I can even not breathe. When we go to a restaurant, what we want is having a good meal and enjoying it rather than smelling secondhand smoke and we should have the right. So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should think about others more often and avoid smoking in public places.",B1
"Nowadays, some people take smoking as a method release the stress, but I strongly oppose smoking. There are several reasons presented as follows. First of all, it is in terms of health that smoking is very bad to body at all. In fact, researches nowadays report that cigarettes contain nicotine and tar which is proved badly harmful to human health. According to studies that smoking has higher percent to suffer from lung cancer, laryngo-carcinoma, and oral cavity cancer and so on. What is more, it is not only smokers themselves but also others who don't smoke that would be harmed by cigarettes. That is, experts believe that secondhand smoke do much more damage to people. Besides, they say that a secondhand smoker is smoking six cigarettes while a smoker is smoking only one cigarette. Therefore, stopping smoking is not simply for smokers themselves but also others nearby them. Last but not the least; it is smoking itself that would build a negative appearance of smoker. Most people don't like the smell of cigarettes. Therefore, many people believe that the action of smoking would make them obscene and disliked by others. In a result, we would try our best to prevent people from smoking.",B1
"Should Smoking be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country? What do you think about it? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Not only at the restaurants but also in all public places where have many people such as in church, libraries, kid's play ground, museums, theaters, etc. Because it is not good for the smokers' health and people that surround them. Why is Smoking so bad for the smokers' health and people that surround them? It is because I known that in cigarettes, there is second hand smoke that contains all of the toxins. There are so many diseases that happen to smoker and people that smell smoke it. They include heart disease, pregnancy complications and the well know disease, cancer. The Carbon in a cigarette is extremely dangerous too. The Carbon binds with the Hemoglobin in the blood stream. When that happens, the Hemoglobin will not allow the red blood cells to carry and transport oxygen throughout the human body. Nicotine, it damages your brain right after you first smoke by opening up the receptors in it. When you sleep at night the Nicotine level drops very low and that is the reason people usually reach for a cigarette right after they wake up. So I consider that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country and other public places too.",B1
"The reality of life usually starts when one is already working. Eyes are opened to the ugly truth which pertains to the life which is really simple but people are making it complicated. People are so busy. You sleep late. You get up early. You get broke. You can't really depend on someone all the time. I believe that some college students have been already realizing about the reality of life though, since some already have a part time job. In my opinion, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Every step that we take prepares us for the following big step. Being a college student as well, I believe that we must be preparing for more pressuring toils that we have to withstand in the future. Not to mention the sleepless nights because of the overload of home works, a part time job would be really a part of the training. People look at this situation at different perspectives. Most look it as a way to earn money to spend for shopping or for other desired wants. Some think of it as a way for starting an investment for their future. While a few view it as a way to train their selves in preparation for the real world.",B1
"I don't agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course there are both good aspects and bad aspects in having a part-time job. I'm going to write why I don't agree with the idea by showing both good aspects and bad aspects of having a part-time job. Let me explain. They say young people can acquire far more things than older people in the same time. If we have a part-time job, we can get some money, and getting money from one's work is surely a happy thing. However, we can't actually have what we could have acquired if we had done something other than working. This is a bad aspect of having a part-time job. On the contrary, having a part-time job itself can teach something important to us. For example, through a part-time job, we can realize the value of money, or realize our parents' effort to raise us, know how we can give better service to the customers, or encounter many people and enhance our knowledge. Those are the good aspects of having a part-time job, and we cannot do those things by just reading our textbook or something like that. In my opinion, college students should regard their study more important than anything else. If we want to experience the good aspects of having a part-time job, I think it is a good idea to have a short term part-time job. However, I think having a part-time job regularly can sometimes affects the quality of college students' learning. Therefore, I think it is better for them to study as much as possible than to spend their precious time of youth working, unless they are in financially difficult state.",B2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because it is impolite and it damages organs themselves and family. There are many groups think smoking is modern, handsome and others, but it is not real. It is following bad behavior. But now, there are many groups banning it such as political, school, elder and others. The smoking is just a little happiness some time. Smoking is impolite, because it is annoy for people. And then, the smoker is banned from social more and more. Especially, at the restaurants and other public places. Smoking is damages organs themselves and family, even if smoke along time. It will be symptom that is cancer. The smoker has black tooth, yellow nail, their face is unusual or ugly and others. Somebody supports them, but just a little. There are a lot of banners more than. The banners are serious about that, because, they know the result and ban same bad drugs.

"In my opinion I think Part-time job is not too much important for me because I don't have problem about financial position. However, someone that has a problem in financial position part-time job will important for him. Part-time job is a job that works on free-time. You must allocate time to study and work. If you don't allocate your time good enough you will have learning problems. When you have learning problems you will focus on it carefully. You must intend to study more and you will have a good chance to work in the future. Benefit of part-time jobs, part-time job will give you much of experience to work and make you have tolerance and self-discipline. Your boss will summarize and evaluate your works. Furthermore, Part-time practice you to be a diligent and be enthusiastic person. Everything that I have said before is very essential in every jobs and every position. However, part-time job will affect to your concentration on learning. It may make you tired to study. If you can't work and study together you should choose one of them and do it the best. But if you can work on part-time job and study together it is very good for you.",B1
"I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the following reasons. The restaurants are the place where people not only eat the food but also enjoy talking and feel relax. People who smoke usually wants to smoke every one or two hours. Also there are people who are looking for a smoke after eating. Smoking is banned at a lot of places in Japan now, for instance at an office, at a street, in a taxi and so on. If smoking is completely banned even at all the restaurants, they will get irritated. In addition, I have watched the news on TV that the staff at restaurants complained, which is in a town forbidden completely to smoke at all the public places. They said that they had less customers than before smoking is forbidden. Therefore banning from smoking is not good for the restaurants as well as smokers. I think that it is enough as long as the restaurants make a smoking section and a non-smoking section. They don't have to ban smoking. That is why I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
It is true that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Why smoking should be completely banned at all country ? Because smoking causes many trouble for your body and it is not good for healthy and causes lung problems too. Not just the people smoking get that problems the other visitor can get the problems too. Not just passive smoker but the passive smoker can get the lung attack to because the breath with smoke from the smoker. Not just the smokers self will get hurt bit the other non smoker people will gets hurt too. Because of that reason smoking is always be banned in all restaurant because it will be disturb the other visitor for that restaurant. Some restaurant or hotel will give a punishment for the visitor who use smoke it the area that smoke is banned usually the punishment is you must pay for the punishment. The punishment is depend in the that restaurant. Because of that many restaurant give the smoker rooms for them to smoke and usually it apart from the restaurant main room an there is visitors don't want to become one whit the smoker. Because of that the restaurant banned the smoker except they have smoking rooms.,B1
"The Smoking should not be allowed in a restaurant. A restaurant is a place where people eat a meal. Hygiene is very important in a restaurant. But smoking in a restaurant pollutes the air inside. Air pollution can harm either smoker or nonsmoker. Cigarette smoke is harmful for human. There are numerous harmful elements. Particularly, the child in a restaurant is vulnerable these elements. Smoking can prompted a disease such as lung cancer. The Smoke is fatal to people. Especially second-hand smoking is injurious to nonsmoker's health. Many of people hate the smell of cigarette. They have to bear the smell while they have a meal. This is unfair for nonsmoker in it. And, it is also damaged restaurant's image. If the store be enveloped the smoke, the customer feel displeasure and then they don't go there anymore. Eventually the intended damage is raised. Smoking is an action that affect bad effect not only smoker but also the other. Therefore it should not be permitted to smoking in a public area like a restaurant. Smokers have to know why smoking should not be allowed in a restaurant. And they keep the manners in a cafeteria. Then people have meals comfortably.",B1
"Now in the universities more and more students take a part time job. There are many reasons that can explain these phenomena. To start with, many university students think a part time job is necessary. First, they can earn some money through the part time job to ease their parents' burden. Second, they can communicate with people out of school and learn much knowledge in the society. Doing a part time job can widen their field of vision. The experience of doing a part time job will do well to them when they find a job after gradating from the school. What's more, there are also many people who against a part time job. They insist that one's time is limited. If a student spends much time on a part time job, he or she will pay less attention to his or her study. And the society is too complicated. Students should not enter into it when they don't have the ability to deal with it well. Last but not least, as far as I'm concerned, we should make a good attitude towards the part time job. As a student, what we should pay most attention to is our studies. Then in we spare time we can do some good part time job, such as a tutor. That may become good experience in our university life.",B1
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for the health. Smoking harms not only smoker's health but also another person's health. So the Japanese government is beginning to prohibit smoking. For example, school teachers are prohibited smoking inside an elementary school and a junior high school. When I was a junior high school student, school teachers are prohibited smoking not only inside buildings of school but also inside the others. In America, the state governments imposed a high tax on the cigarettes so that smokers try to give up smoking. As a result, the price of cigarettes rose and was more than 1, 000 yen, but the policy was effective in giving up smoking. Therefore smoking is considered to be bad for the health in a lot of countries and many governments begin to adopt a policy to smoking. There is another reason why I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In Japan, there are seats in the smoking section and nonsmoking seats in restaurants. But each seat doesn't completely be divided because we can't separate the air in seats in the smoking section from the air in nonsmoking seats. So people who sit a nonsmoking seat breathe in smoke of cigarette. Therefore I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"I agree with the state Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Since a cigarette is a substance that is bad for the body. It has very bad smell and toxic smoke when it was fired and the smoke will diffuse all of the place, for example, if you smoke in your bedroom, the smog is going to distribute around the room. The cigarette is not only bad for a smoker but also for the people that are around him because it had released carbon monoxide (CO), tar and nicotine which contain in the cigar during it was fired and these are very harmful to the lungs of smoker and nearby people. In case of the restaurant where people go to have in each meals. This place must be clean (no pollution), has beautiful views, is attractive etc. So if the some consumer smoked in the restaurant, it will cause the impurity in food because of the toxic smoke from the cigar. and this restaurant may be banned. To solve this problem, the owner should post No smoking tag in front of yours and if someone resist this command, he must be fined. Moreover you may divide the place for smoking and mustn't disturb the others.",B1
"All of people hope to get a good job in the future. Of course, I think this topic may depend on people aptitudes. From my point of view, there are many aptitudes for people to get the good job, especially ""Is a part-time job important for college students?"" the first reason that is important for college students, because some families have a few budget to support their children to school and university. So the college students have to work for getting more money to support themselves. The second reason is, whenever students have to use more money, but they would not like to disturb their parents they can earn some money by themselves by taking part-time job. The third reason, if the would like to pay their time effectively they can take apart-time job. Beside they pay their times efficiently, they also fun with their job. The fourth reason, part-time job makes students being really proud to gain new experience and earn much money by themselves. For the last reason, part time job can be a thing that makes students have great responsibilities, such as punctuality, being honest and relationship with other people. To sum up, I would not like to focus on ""part time job is important or unimportant for college students, but if students take a part time job while they are studying, they can learn the true meaning of responsibilities.",A2
"The problem of smoking in the restaurant and another place is the main problem that causes a lot of problem to people. Many people who don't smoke will be boring about the smoker. The bad smell from the cigarette make the people in the restaurant annoy and don't want to eat anymore. This problem is hard to solve especially in the country that everything is easy and people don't like to follow the rules. Many smokers think it is cool to show other people that they can smoke and release the smoke to the air. In fact, this bad habit is hated by the people who don't smoke. When I go to do some exercise at the park or go shopping, I try to get away from the smokers. If I have to face with them, I will use my hand to cover my nose. I think that the bad smell from the cigarette make me have a headache. I also find that there are smokers in many restaurants they smoke on the walkways and talk loudly. These habits annoy me and other guests very much. I think that smoking should be banned in the restaurants.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ??? In my opinion, I believe that smoking should be completely banned. Not only is smoking any form of tobacco dangerous to you health, but it is also bad for the health of those around you. Smoking should be banned at the restaurants and for all public areas. Smoking negatively affects our society through environmental problems, economic problems, health risks to others, and especially health problems it cause within children. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes and doing so does not benefit anyone in any way. Smoking in public is the same as driving drunk because both endanger the lives of innocent people who choose not to engage in the reckless behavior. The only difference is that with smoking the affects are not visible immediately because it has long term affects. Banning smoking in public will ultimately increase the quality of life and in turn will better society as a whole. At last I agree that completely smoke-free places are the ideal, and some businesses have taken the decision to go completely smoke-free. However, everyone agrees that, it is a matter of rights - the right of smokers to smoke versus non-smokers to protect from passive smoking and to breathe clean air.",B1
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Why do I say? First, when we graduate from college, everyone have to get a job. Why not get a part-time job early to learn about social experience? It is very important to be trained about social quality when student period. If you have not any skill of social, you would afraid of working after graduation. Second, it will make students understand the toil of work that let them to cherish thing. Almost students don't worry about cost of living, because their parents would provide finance to them. So they are easy to waste money. However, when they make money by themselves, it would let them to use totally about money, time, thing, and so on. Third, if you have a part-time job that could make you easily use money. Although, job can make someone learn more experience, it also can bring other money to self. That is a very special mode to learn about controlling money. Someone will make use of money to do more things. For example, learning language, saving, dancing, shopping, and traveling, and so on. I have a part-time job in my college life now, so I agree totally about the idea. Maybe someone disagree my thought. So what? Everyone is in charge of itself.",B1
"Personally, I don't think that it's terribly important for a college student to have a part time job. If he or she really needs the money in order to pay tuition or to get by without starving, then I would deem it important to find some kind of work. However, if finances are not an issue, I don't believe that it's important or necessary. Perhaps there are a lot of people who think that working is a great life experience and that by working a part time job, college students will better understand the value of a dollar and the value of hard work. Don't you think that the 40 to 45 years of having to work after graduating is enough time to get that experience? I do. The youth of today have so many pressures as it is. I don't think that adding to that, the pressure of a part time job while they are trying to prepare for the rest of their lives, pass exams, fit into social clicks, avoid drugs and social rejection will make them a better person. If it is at all possible, I believe we should let the youth of today focus on their studies and let them enjoy a less complicated life before they are thrown to the working dogs for the remainder of their working lives.",C2
"Smoking is using a small cylinder stick that created numerous surrounding issues. In our society today, it is already a proven fact that smoking may lead to different health problems. It is also observed from research and experiments that second-hand smokers tend to be more susceptible to graver health-related risks. A law has already been implemented in the Philippines wherein people are designated smoking areas, especially in public places. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country, whether is a fine dining restaurant or an informal one. First of all, restaurants are places for food consumption. And these places must always be maintained for them to be clean and neat. On the other hand, cigarettes contain many different chemicals that may contaminate both the food and as well as the bodies of the diners. As mentioned a while ago, second-hand smoking is more dangerous in terms of its health effects. As a result, people may obtain these chemicals into their bodies. I also strongly discourage assigning smoking areas within the vicinity of restaurants. The reason behind this is that the chemicals from cigarettes may travel inside the restaurant and reach the food and the people eating. There may also be cases where the restaurant owners will be held responsible for the diseases their customers may obtain.",B1
" From my point of view, I partly agree with the point that college student should have a part?time job. College is a very important step before enter the society. University and the society is very similar, you must learn some practical life skills in the university. But the fact is that you can't learn such skills in the textbooks in the university. I think in the university, we have more time to do something we really want to do, so why not try to seek for the chance, and do a part?time job? That will really benefit to us. Though a part?time job is not a official wok, it still quite difficult for those unexperienced. You will learn how to treat people, how to deal with the problems, also some troubles we have never met before. For us, it means enter the society ahead of time. It is beneficial. But everything has two sides, do a part?time job also has its disadvantage, if you can't balance the relation between study and work, it will influence your study After all, I think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages. So the college students should have a part?time job.",B1
"The sentence 'Cigarette smoking is dangerous for the health ' has been told to everyone. It has been spread out using cigarette packs, commercials and posters, yet people still continue to do the act of smoking. Also, although scientists have proven that cigarettes contain tar, nicotine and other substances which make smokers addicted to them which in return cause lung cancer and other sicknesses, people still continue to smoke. People usually smoke in open areas, but there are also some who smoke inside enclosed areas such as restaurants. Despite the 'No Smoking ' signs inside restaurants, some smokers still smoke within the vicinity; they ignore the signs even though the signs were specifically put up to prohibit smokers from smoking inside the restaurant, especially when there are other customers eating their meals. I have once experienced eating inside a restaurant when a group of customers started smoking in front of the air conditioner. Never liking smokers, I was not only furious at the group of customers, but also at the manager and staff of the restaurant. I was infuriated at the group of customers because they were sitting in front on the 'No Smoking ' sign, yet they did not only choose to overlook the sign, but they also chose to disregard the emotions of other customers. As for the manager and staff, I was exasperated at them for they could have told the group to immediately stop smoking because the group was polluting the air while most were still eating and by their nonchalance of the group's decision to disregard the clear sign. To sum up, I believe that smoking should be prohibited inside restaurants, because the smoke does not only pollute the air which dirties the food, but it also causes lung cancers for smokers and inhalers of second hand smoke.",B1
"The majority of countries by the past few years have extended the ban of smoking of tobacco in all forms in the majority of public places; this includes the category of enclosed and open locations such as the hospitals, shopping centers, schools and restaurants, this is to include bars, village coffeehouses. I am a believer that dining should provide an enjoyable experience to all individuals and once this is compromised or affected it no longer will provide a sense of well-being in dining. I is a fact that when smoking, the olfactory senses of the taste buds on the tip of the tongue is hampered in its ability to distinguish one flavour from the other, spoiling the palette not only for the diner but those unfortunate enough to sit within range of the tobacco smoke plume. It could lead to the possibility of the triggering off of asthmatic attack, or allergic reaction similar to hayfever, due to the differing sensitivity levels toward foreign particulate matter. It is shown that hemoglobin levels in Red Blood Cells could be effectively reduced leading to increased stress on the cardiovascular system and the possibility of pre-mature aging and occurrence of heart attack. The formation of atherosclerotic plaque leading to the blockage of capillaries could result in fatal stroke, susceptible especially in the elderly population. The production of free radicals would lead to damage of lung tissue and formation of tumour i. e. carcinogenic effect.",B1
"Nobody would think that money is not important. Especially for students, how sweet the first time making money by himself or herself. Some students have to making money to afford everything he or she needed. This kind of students has no choice, their parents asked they to make their own money that they must find a part-time job. Except these students, most of students make money for themselves. I think that finding a part-time job to students is good experience to help them learning more skill or knowledge what they couldn't get from university or college. But I think not every kind of job is suitable to students. Some sort of job would not be a helpful working experience. So if students do not have to worry about money, I think find a job that related with major would be a more useful experience. Even thought I support the viewpoint that student could find a part-time job, studying still would be students' main job. However, studying is the real job for students. Not only learning more skill or knowledge is the reason I support, but learning how to handle students' own money is important too. To know how to make money be more useful could let people be rich. Therefore, I think that it's important for students to get a part-time job.",B1
"One reason is because smoking damages our health. Smoking increase the risk of lung cancer and is risk factor for others disease such as high blood pressure, angina and atherosclerosis. The damage can be even higher when the other person inhales the smoke that burn form the cigarette. This can happen in a restaurant if smoking is not banned because diner are often sitted close together. Another reason is because smoking can irritate the other person appetiate. Imagine that if a person next to your table is smoking while you are having your dinner in the restaurant, you would definitely feel uncomfortable as you be worried whether the dust from the smoke would goes to your food. However, some may think smoking should not be banned. One opposing reason is because they felt that people should have the freedom to choose what they want to do even in the restaurant. It is a person habit to smoke before and after eating the dinner. The restaurant should not restrict it. However, this reason is not valid as although the person should have freedom to choose what they want to do but they should not forgotten that they are cause others people discomfort though their action. This is what we should not do in a civilised country. ",B1
"I have a dad and he always smoking after he finished his breakfast, his lunch, his dinner. Not only after his eating, but also when I walk around with them (my family). And I really do not like a people who like smoking. I do not smoking, because my mom told me that smoking just broken your body, it was bad for me, cause at home I always whiff my father's cigarette same at my college. Many student at my college have a cigarette, and when I connect wi-fi at the ground floor they whiff their cigarette. What can I doing? I just sit and play music from my notebook and absolutely start to collect information from the internet. Cigarette is number one industry that made money in Indonesia, many people in Indonesia like cigarette, their mind is like full of'cigarette', after they do something, they always 'turn on' their cigarette. If we banned them at all the restaurant in Indonesia, I think they will be protest to the owner of the restaurant. But there is still a restaurant in Indonesia that from the beginning banned their customer to not smoking when they are eating in that restaurant.",A2
"As far as I'm concerned, doing part-time jobs is not only important but necessary for college students. The reasons are as followed. First of all, most college students are not teenagers but adults, therefore, they shouldn't depend all on their parents. On the other hand, the expenses of studying in colleges are much larger than that of studying in high schools. Don't you think that we should do something to reduce the burden on our parents? Doing part-time jobs is a good way to help us. Then, considering that the experiences of real society will benefit the college students a lot when hunting for jobs, part-time jobs, and part-time jobs is important. By taking a major-related part-time job, students can not only improve their academic studied but gain much experience that they will never get from the textbooks. The students who do part-time jobs have more opportunities to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced up with a wider variety of problems to solve, which will teach the students a lot about the real society. As we all know, the life is the best teacher in our life. At last, some people say that the students may have the enough time to do study and jobs at the same time. In fact, take my experience for example; the college students have a lot of time after the study and many people kill the time by playing computer games. Why don't we spend the time doing some jobs? To conclude, I think that doing part-jobs is very important for college students. There is no doubt that the jobs will bring us many benefits in many ways.",A2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, money is very important for our life. Everybody spends money to pay everything, no matter car, home, food, technology, medicine, education, etc. If you have no money, you don't have a comfortable in your life. Moreover, education is very important for everybody. Especially the modern people like me. If we have enough education, we will get the comfortable in our life. Although, I get an enough education, somebody doesn't have opportunity to study. They don't have opportunity to study, since they have no money to study. When I go to study in the university, I think I have to buy many things. These are example about things that I have to buy or pay; uniforms, textbook, computer, dormitory, the internet per month, cost of living in daily life, cost of register, etc. My parents have to pay for me about 80, 000 baht in the first month. However, I spend a lot of money; it's very important things in my life. My parents pay for me about 5, 000 bath per month, but I think it's enough for me. I never buy the brand name, since I think it's not important for me. I never eat food that so expensive. So, I think the part-time job isn't important for college students.",B1
"People will not be allowed to smoke at some restaurants and apartment complexes. It is desirable not to smoke in public places. If you don't want to die, you should stop smoking. Also Secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. Smoking affects other people as well as the smoker I think that we should think about others in public places Also Smoking is prohibited in most public places in the other country. Secondhand smoking enforces a law and if someone smoking will be punished by law. But Restaurant and public places make smoking room for smoker. Smoking was banned in public areas mostly because of passive smoking affecting others. The city already holds designated smoking zones to separate smokers in some public spaces. If I am near a smoker, it's like I am smoking, too Also, if anyone smokes cigarettes, try to stay away from them while they are smoking. Smoking damages your health. On cigarette packs, there are warning labels stating that smoking is hazardous to your health. The nicotine in tobacco is a substance harmful to the human body and the cigarette's detrimental effects on the body are immeasurable. Because anywhere should be banned smoke and Second-hand smoke.",A2
"I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Because there are some faults. I would like to write about them. Firstly it ignores human rights of smokers. Smoking surely causes harm to people in surround. But smokers have right of smoking. It is no good that we one-sidedly force our opinions. Secondly managers of restaurants lose the revenue by ban the smoking. Because banning the smoking prevent guests of smoker go to the restaurant. So the number of guests decreases and the revenue also decreases. Thirdly restaurant is precisely the place where guest comfortably enjoys eating. For smokers it is necessary to smoking to have a good time. Therefore banning smoking is equal with disturbing smokers' right of enjoying. Finally banning smoking treats nonsmoker well and treats smokers coldly. This is a kind of discrimination. Even kids know that discrimination is bad. It pays attention to only nonsmokers. For such reason, I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. But I agree with placing some nonsmoking seats, because it reflects nonsmokers' rights. This way brings equality between smoker and nonsmoker. However, it is not probably best way. I would like to study deeply and find the better way.",A2
"For me it is up to the student if he/she wants to have a part time job as long as his/her priority is studying and learning, because a part time job can help to finish your studies even without the help of your parents it can also helped you to become more responsible in balancing your time with your study and your job. This will also help to build your priorities in life and focues to your goal. But some of my friends stopped studying and started to work on full time employee, because they enjoyed the not so high salary they received every month. They just kept saying this What is the purpose of studying if I already earn money for myself. they said those words without realizing that eduacational background is one of the requirements to have a good and maybe to be promoted if your part time job is related to your course taking. The point is you should be flexible, open-minded and focus on what is your main goal in life so that the chance of making it is very high. Lastly and i think the most important thing is the inspiration like a family member, a friend, a special someone or your dream that persue you to continue achieving your goal",B1
"Many people think doing part time job is an important experience, and I'm no exception. My first part time job was a telephone caller in a cram school. It was an easy and also an uneasy job. When I called someone I didn't know, he or his families would shout at me because they thought I was a liar. But when I called my friends, I could chat with them and it was much easier to invite them to the cram school to listen to the classes. Until I went to the university, I did similar part time jobs in different cram schools. Afterward, I went to Kaohsiung to study English. There were more chances for me to find different part time jobs because Kaohsiung was a big city. In the first year in Kaohsiung, I was a waitress in a restaurant. I gave menus, ordered for customers and cleaned the surrounding everyday. Although it was tiring, I still liked there because the boss and other co-workers were kind. I worked there for 1. 5 years. In the second year, I taught elementary school and junior high school students English in YMCA. Also, I started to be a tutor, too. Teaching students in a class and one on one were quite different, but both of them were fun and challenging to me. From then on, I like to teach students and enjoy the time to get along with them. I think I am lucky since I find out my interest by doing part time jobs. To do part time jobs can make friends and some money, but we still should make sure that we deal with the school work well. After all, to study hard is the basic work for students.",B1
"What's your dream? Being lawyers or scientists? You can do anything if you keep trying. However, we should learn to be sociable before working in the real world. I think a part-time job could be good guidance to working in the world so I think it's important for college students. Today, I'd like to speak about my opinion of part-time jobs. This speech consists of 3 parts. First part is definition, second is merits and demerits of part-time jobs and last is conclusion. First; definition, having part-time jobs means that college students work and get some money. Second, merits of part-time jobs isn't only getting money but also improving our social skills. A demerit is losing our time to study. Last, I concluded that part-time jobs are worthwhile to do for college students. If we have part-time jobs, we can study enough because we can relatively decide working time or working styles as we like. Moreover, we can communicate with many people through part-time jobs, know what working and learning social morals are. Social morals mean greetings, a style of cloths and hairs, a way of talking and so on. Most people all over the world think social morals important, which often give a big effect to our success in our business. Do you have a dream in the future? It's high time when we, college students, seriously think what we will do after graduating from a university. I think a part-time job is a first step to achieve your dream and last chance for college students to experience working in various fields. Part-time jobs will make us sociable.",B1
"Thai society has now spread to smoking is very dangerous. Both smoke and the smell of cigarette smoke. When smoking was spawned what follows is a serious disease such as lung cancer, throat black teeth are wound so as to eliminate the cigarette away. Be ignored by the place that they are not smoking, especially public places. Do not agree that restaurants in shopping malls to people smoking in the restaurant. At least it is a shopping center of people of all ages. And where the air is the smell of cigarettes easy. As well as crop disease Lung well ever. People don't smoke but smell will have lung disease and cancer same smokers. People must forbid smokers in the restaurants. It to save who don't smoke and children, woman or old people if this group of people having food in the restaurants. It helps the restaurants have fresh air and look good. Food is delicious and all happy to eat. It should be big sing tell the smokers to don't smoke inside. Not welcome smokers because it's very bad for people. Smoking is not good at all we should help each other to stop them to hurt people accidently with the smoking.",A2
"I think that a part-time job is important to university students. The reason why a part-time job is important is that we can experience various things and learn our view of life through experience of working. For example, I have a part-time job tutoring a high school student who is my friend's sister in mathematics and science. At first I thought it easy to teach her their subject because I was good at mathematics and science when I was a high school student. In addition, I was not serious since my student is my friend's sister. But I realized that I was wrong to think it easy to teach her when I visited my friend's home and taught her. I did not realize that thinking is different from real teaching until I taught her in practice. After I realized my mistakes, I learned difficulty of teaching others and responsibility to work through this experience. Other part-time job gives us valuable experience, too. That is why I think that we take responsibility for our action as a number of society through part-time jobs. And I think that studying is important when we are university student, but I think that having a part-time job may be important and valuable more than studying. So I want to go on trying to have a part-time job.",A2
"Smoking became a part of humanity, but what does it really do and how does it really benefit or destroys one's life? According to many researchers, smoking doesn't have any benefits in the health of a human. But according to smokers, smoking help them pass through their problems and help them psychologically. In my perspective, smoking is just a tool in destroying one's health, life and planet. One of my uncles, who are a heavy smoker, said that smoking just makes you cool and that is the most absurd thing I heard about smoking in my whole life. He is just addicted to it and he doesn't want to admit it. His body became more vulnerable to sickness, his lips are becoming black, and the worst is the smell of his breath. One time we had some kind of family reunion and we ate in a restaurant. I always enjoy the food in there because it is very delicious and the atmosphere was very comfortable and refreshing until my uncle's smoking habit ruined everything and that's when I realize that smoking isn't banned in that restaurant. My uncle's seat is just right in front of me and every time he smokes, I smelled it and almost taste it while eating. It was the worst experience that I had on eating in that restaurant. Smoking should be banned at the restaurant in the entire country because the smoke could go to other people's lungs while eating and that would be really dangerous to one's health.",B1
"I disagree with the above statement for several reasons. First, we (thankfully) live not in a communist or fascist nation, but in a democratic one. The underlying pillar of a democracy is the right to choose how to live. This right of choice must extend to restaurants. Ownership should have the right to permit smoking on their premises. Ownership must, however, be clear in letting both their employees and customers know that smoking is permitted. I think signage outside the restaurant should be mandatory, clearly stating the smoking situation. In this manner, both future employees and patrons can exercise their right of choice. If they wish to accept the harm that smoking related illnesses cause, it is indeed their right. Must government regulate all lifestyle choices that harm people? Should Big-Mac sales be regulated, because over indulgence leads to obesity? Should alcohol sales be banned, because over indulgence/reliance leads to innumerable problems? No and No. People have the core right to choose how to live their lives regardless of our agreement. I personally loathe smoking. I find it a foul smelling and disgusting habit. For this reason, I am a big fan of Starbucks, who ban smoking in their stores worldwide.",C2
"Recently, the government develop the law that bans smoking indoors. Some people support it, while some of the smokers are not happy about this. They think it restricts them and deprives of their freedom of smoking. As for me, I am one of the supporters who think smoking indoors should be completely banned, especially at all the restaurants. First of all, restaurants are places for people to have a meal, chat with friends, and take a rest. Restaurants supposed to be comfortable, cozy and clean. Smoking will totally destroy the quality of the food and affect the mood of the diners. Second, smoking does no good to people's health. People used to smoking have liver cancers at a high rate. That is to say, they have poor health than the normal people. What's worse, according to the research, people live with a smoker are more likely to have liver cancers than the smokers. Why? Because the instance that released by the smoking process are more dangerous. As a result, smoking in an indoor place such as restaurant is really selfish! Last but not least, smoking is a bad habit. If the law makes the smokers feel inconvenient to smoke, they don't smoke that often. It is an efficient way to reduce the number of the smokers. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country.",B1
"Everyone knows that smoking is harmful to our health. Even in the pack of the cigarettes, the warning is printed. Although smokers do aware of this fact, many of them do not quit smoking because it is addictive. I also hate smoking, but I disagree to the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Rather, I think it is much better to make smokers smoke only in the smoking area. To begin, this will never stop smokers to smoke. Instead, they will find somewhere else in the restaurant such as bathroom or the entrance of the restaurant because smoking is addictive. It is true that if we ban smoking inside, it would make much better atmosphere for customers who do not like smoking because there are no smokers in their surroundings directly. But, still, customers might feel smokes, if smokers smoke in the bathroom secretly or in the entrance of the restaurant. It affects to other people because the smoke might flow into the restaurant. However, we can solve this problem by making the smoking area. Banning smoking completely would not solve the problem at all, and many owners of the restaurant may also refuse this option, worrying smoking customer would not come. But if we change the proposal as making restricted area for smokers, smoking area, it will satisfy both non-smokers and smokers. By satisfying all kinds of the customers, owners will also like this idea, which is more realistic proposal to everyone. Therefore, banning smoking completely in the restaurant is unrealistic and ineffective way for the convenience of customers. Of course, it would be the best option to quit smoking to every smoker, but because this is quite impossible, it is much better to open some place to smoke which is only for the smokers.",B2
"Smoking Smoking is the activity that a lot of people like to do in their daily life but they do not know that smoking is effect to their selves and it also effect to other people near them too. Almost people say that smoking help them to be happy from something. They are still smoking event they know that smoking is bad for their selves but they do not think that smoking will hurt other people near them such as your family or your co-worker. But we do not have any way to stop people who like to smoke because there are too many people. So we have to take care our selves by stay far away from the people who smoking. You should learn about disadvantage of smoking and tell to yourself and the others that it is bad for heath. However, event we cannot stop people that smoking but if young people do not smoking, there will be less smoking people too. Every body's healthy is very important so you should think before you smoke that if you smoke how many people that you going to hurt them. If you really want to smoke you should smoke far away from the other people. You do not care yourself but you should care the other self.",A2
"I believe that a college student should not be burdened with the responsibility of fiscal independence, and that none should assume that he should hold a part-time job during the course of his studies. I have three reasons to support my claim. Firstly, college is an essential part of the academically minded individual's growth and development. A high-school student generally focuses his academic attention of mastering basic skills, the foremost of which is learning how to think. In college, however, he begins to explore concepts in much greater detail and depth, engaging in activities of critical thought and analysis. Balancing the mundane realities of holding a part-time job will simply distract this level of focus, and hamstring the overall efficacy of his college experience. Secondly, College is an important time in the social and sexual growth an individual, and his time not spent studying is best taken up with developing himself in these ways in order to become a stable, confident and contributing member of society in later years. Finally, part-time work generally pays very little, so the actual financial gain from such work is almost negligible. His time is much better spent in academic and social activities in order to prepare him for his future social responsibilities. Besides, there will be plenty of time after college is finished to learn how to hold down a job and manage his finances.",C2
"In recent years, many college graduates have difficulty in finding a job and face a fierece competition. The situtation has aroused a common concern about if is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Personally speaking, I adovocate college students should have a part-time job. On one hand, we know, college students have a part-time job can earn their pockets money, and in this way, it can reduce the burden of their family. Besides, they may make friends with many people from who college students can benefit a lots. On the other hand, as job markets are decreasing, unemployment among the graduates is increasing. College students have more skills and experience can make them more appealing to the employers and companies. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a good way to enrich your skills and experience when you at college. Taking advantage of your college free time, improving and enhancing yourself, when you graduate from college you will excel other college students and don't worry about you will face a fierce competition and cannot find a good job. In my perspective, a college student to have a part-time job has many adavantages and disadvantages. It is not only can earn money that can solve your financial crisis, but also you can learn a lot of experience and knowledge that can perfect you. So in order to have more chance than others, college students should take part-time job and make use of our free time to enhance oursleves.",B1
"SMOKING should be banned in restaurants/hotels or not? I am totally agreed with this point of view but here the question arises that how an act of an individual person can is harmful for others. Every person is independent and in the whole world there is no law of interfering in one's personal life. But one's INDEPENDENCE ENDS WHERE HIS RIGHT STARTS. It's the responsibility of a person that his act will not harmful for others. Everyone knows that smoking is less harmful for smoker or more harmful for the people sitting near him. In hotels or restaurants where people come for relaxation or enjoyment a smoker creates a bad impact. People dislike him and teenagers attract towards him, the craze of smoking develops in their minds. Smoker disturbs People by smoke while they are eating food or anything else. It also causes serious diseases. So what should we have to do in this situation? In this situation it is a responsibility of hotel management to make smoking rooms or band smoking in sitting or dinning hall. It's also the responsibility of government to assign security, police or special rangers to stop smoking in public places. This may help our environment to be clean.",B1
"In my opinion, Smoking area of restaurants in the country must be completely banned. Restaurant is one of public places. Public place is not private space but space which Many people are using. Smoking Act like cigarette is harmful to someone in. For example, the health of babies to cigarette smoke is deadly. Also, cigarette smoke negatively affects pregnant women. These negative affect impacts on their general health problems, as well as cause of Death will bring extreme problems. Therefore, for this reason, Smoking in public places such as restaurants and should be Prohibited to all relevant. But in many nations, the law is unclear on the act of smoking in public places. Having clearly established the law, Penalties including fines system will be Strengthened. So, I want to say that strengthen the law governing corporal punishment And consequent damage to others that that is a way to reduce smoking behavior. After this process the posted, the effect will necessarily receive and people need to Worry about cigarette smoke will be reduced. Smoking should be completely banned at All the restaurants in the country. I agree strongly with the following statements. Smokers must conduct their own action and should be aware that it is critical for people Which is not smoke and the others to damage in all respects. At the moment, Change is the time to recognize the urgency of smokers.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurant because in cigaratte has ""Nicotine"" which cause the cancer besides cigaratte'll affect for smoker, it'll affect to person who around with, So smoker should have responsible for public by don't smoke in the public place or community place and should smoke in the place where permitted to smoke. Smoking in the restaurant is regarded as smoke in the public place, If you smoked you'll ignore the right of other, So you should come out to smoke or smoke in the place where the restaurant permitted to smoke, if you disobeyed you'll get punished according to the law, you must pay the fine amount of 2, 000 bahts and the owner of restaurant must pay the fine amount of 20, 000 bahts if he doesn't dissuaded you, which this get into the trouble in the sense of law, Infact smokers should realized by themselves, which cigarette doesn't have advantage for themselves. To sum up smoking in the restarurant is selfishness because the other must smell the smoke, which dangerous for themselves, so the smoker shouldn't do that besides the smoking'll bring the affect for health, it'll consumed the assets by useless, So everybodies shouldn't smoke not only resteauant but should quit the smoking permanent.",B1
"One day, every person in the world will facing the reality that they should go to work and earn some money to keep living. Even Money is not everything, People still need it for their own life. It is important for college students to have a part time job. It can help them to explore their own talent and make them ready to facing the business world. It could be any job, such as a restaurant waiter, salesman, even as an entrepreneur. Part time job is not like a full time job. Part time job have a shorter work time and also have less of money than full time job. Although they are not earn a lot of money, but they get an experience of a life time. It can make them become more mature and understand how hard working is. So they will never get easily spend their own money from now. Part time job also can help their parents to educate their character. Because every success person in the world start their successful from their own life character. Without any good Character, some one will easily fall down, even they are already in the top. So the best lesson from part time job is not how to earn a money, but an Experience of life that can make them tough, strong, and ready to facing the world.",B1
"These days, there are more and more places where smoking is banned. This is why many people have got interested in their health because of the progress in scientific research. For example, a scientific research tells us that passive smoking is much more harmful to our body than active smoking. In other words, it is possible for a smoker to make all the people around him ill, lung cancer! Smoking should be banned at places which many people visit, such as stations, offices and restaurants. But it is not right to ban it completely. Some smokers think of smoking as an essential deed in their lives :they may think smoking is as important as breathing. If they cannot smoke at restaurant, they may feel unhappy, cannot have happy conversations and cannot take a good rest. It may cause many problems in their work. For instance, a white-collar worker can't suggest good ideas on their business and a blue-collar worker can't show their full abilities. We don't have the right to deprive them of freedom of taking a happy rest... For another reason, we must consider the loss of products of human culture. Tobacco which originally came from cigar is one of the greatest products of human culture. It has long long history. So, it is a pity that we lose it owning to the excessive bans on smoking. Of course, it is very important to think about the health of those who around smokers. Smoking may lead them to death. So, we must make systems which allow both smokers and non-smokers to enjoy a happy rest!",B1
The great phrase smoking kills life is true because it causes lot of diseases and infections in human body. Smoking is also a great enemy of your money. Smoking is the effect that directly brought the end of your health and wealth. A chain smoker causes with lot of problems to human body such as cancer lip cancer and lung cancer even a smoker loses his stamina. I feel myself that smoker are blind and having no brain because the box of cigarettes also contain some cautions that alert a smoker to not use cigarettes but they do repeat this bad habit again and again. Such smokers bring the end of his life wealth. Smoking is not for joy if student community is using for enjoyment or pleasures either it is wed for buffing but it all cause lot of problem regarding health and wealth. so please be away from smoking it is not going to help you to become supportive to family and make you a bad person in society even such person use cigarettes for personality grooming these all facts for false and injurious to your life. Please try to keep yourself from smoking source to death.,B1
What are the importances of having a part time job as a student? What are the disadvantages of having a part time job? The importance of having a part time job as students are having financial independence so they don't have to always ask their parents for money everytime there's a project and things to buy. They will learn the value of money and be responsible in spending the money that they work hard for. Also it makes the students productive. We will learn the value of money. It will give the students more confidence. They will learn how to balance work with studies thus having better time management. Having a part time job while studying can help the students acquire experiences for later life; they won't have to worry about not getting a job because of not having any experience. Having a part time can also help the students to associate with other people and be more sociable. It will also help them to enhance their personal skills. But there are also the disadvantages of having a part time job such as: too much money in hands of a student can lead to bad habits like doing drugs. They can also drop their education because of knowing that they can already earn money so they don't need to study anymore. Having a part time job can also interfere with their studies and can be a reason for them to fail. It can also affect their health by being over fatigue with school and work thus making them sick.,B1
"Life at a college is a worth and memorable period for most people. Students want to keep any experiences for their lives. An important reason why we come to the college or university is we come to gain knowledge. It do not enough for live their lives in the college. Lives in the college are a good time to learn many things. A good way to gain good experience while we are studying is do part-time job. Most people think that students should study only. It is not necessary for them to do part-time job. It is not their duty. Parents have this responsibility. Somebody might say that doing part-time may effects their study such as their grade. Doing part-time job is a good way to support education. It is pretty good, if the part-time job is related to their subject that they are studying. Moreover doing part-time is like a good practicing before we go to our real job. Another reason why student should do a part-time job is helping their parent about educational expense; many families do not have more money. If we can help them by doing part-time happily, we should do it. In short, we should support students to do part-time job. Time in the college is quite short. We should use any second for useful activity, and gain any good experience as much as we can.",B1
" As we all know, nowadays smoking is banned at some restaurants in the country so that those smokers are no longer allowed to smoke in these public places. In my opinion, smoking is not a healthy behavior. And this new rule is good because that banning smoking improve people' health. Smoking can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer. What is worst, when those smokers are able to smoke in these public places, they can also make others sick. But others just could not force smokers to stop smoking until smokers realize their behavior will bring harm to others. However, there are few smokers pay attention to it. Therefore; it is unfair to those nonsmokers to get sick. When banning smoking in public buildings, it will please those nonsmokers. And now with this new rule, smokers have few opportunities to smoke so that it will also improve their health. Also, less smoking in public can do good to our environment. In public places, the harm of smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off into the air. However, those smokers say that it takes away some of their right and freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If someone wants to smoke, there are also some private places allowed. Therefore, smokers will choose to smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have their freedom of smoking. In a word, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us.",B1
"Close your eyes and imagine walking into a restaurant that reeks of smoke; how would the restaurant look like? Without sight, our sense of hearing and smell heighten. Eating, is not just to satisfy our stomach, but an enjoyment. People pay to eat in restaurants, to enjoy the atmosphere, the food and the services. During dining, before the food is placed in front of you, you already know what is to be expected as the waiter walks out with the mouth-watering plate of exquisiteness. The fragrance of the Rosemary roasted lamb soaked in expensive red wine would have done the job! Hence, it is important for all patrons to be able to soak in the moments with all their senses, and to do so, it would be necessary for smoking to be banned in all restaurants. It is widely known that smoking is detrimental to our health, especially to second-hand smokers, which in this case would be the non-smokers of the restaurant. However, for smoking to be banned in restaurants, it may be considered an outrageous move by many smokers. Some may argue, restaurants can simply separate smoking and non-smoking areas to meet the needs of both groups. However, even with the smoking area, it is impossible to contain air particles in an enclosed area. Eventually, smoke will travel from the smoking area to non-smoking area, making the set-up of non-smoking area obsolete. Hence, with smoking banned in restaurants, it will enable the patrons of the restaurant to enjoy the food thoroughly. Furthermore, this encourages smoking patrons to be able to taste the joy as well. Reports have shown that smoking dulls our sense of taste. Over long periods, smokers might be able to regain their sense of taste and start to appreciate food differently(with less smoking breaks and smoke)!",B1
" With more and more college students doing part-time jobs, more and more persons wonder that if it is necessary or important. There is no doubt that the desire to make something meaningful is in everyone'mind. We want to prove ourselves and make values through our best trying. One of the disadvantages of taking part-time jobs is we may not focus on our study. Part-time jobs exactly makes us useful and powerful, but out major tadget is not in that. We must put our study in the first place, then we can have some activities, jobs or joys in the spare time. Moreover, stepping society brings us lots of bad habits. We fix an eye on the materials, However, every coin has two sides. Part-time jobs bring us lots of opportunities, plenty of convenience and amounts of abilities if we deal with them well. Many students who have no part-time working experience can't adapt to the society. We also get some basic skills and whenever we are we have advantages. On the whole, part-time jobs can bring us good as long as we arrange our time well and have a clear understanding on our future life. Everything is not as it seems. We can't expect what is on the way but to try bravely and wisely on out best.",B1
"The ban imposed on smoking at certain locations in Singapore has been an issue of concern in recent years. Places such as public bus stops, train stations and various shopping centers do not allow smoking. The same goes for restaurants in Singapore, where smoking is banned to various extents. One reason why smoking should be banned at restaurants in the country is due to the polluting nature of the activity. The smoke produced by cigarettes is extremely harmful to one's health. This is especially true for second-hand smoking, by which non-smokers are exposed to smoking activities in restaurants and inhale the cigarette smoke while eating. Inhaling the cigarette smoke might even cause people who are enjoying their meals to choke due to the incoming smoke-filled air. In order not to harm other people's health or affect them while they enjoy their meals, smoking should not be allowed inside restaurants. Smoking should also be banned at restaurants which are air-conditioned. Such restaurants can be found almost everywhere in Singapore, including fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's. This is because smoke sensors, which are extremely important as safety measures, might detect cigarette smoke and trigger the fire alarm unnecessarily. As such, some restaurants allow smoking but only at outdoor areas so as not to keep the smoke within the air-conditioned restaurant. In conclusion, smoking should be banned at restaurants due to health reasons. To consider the needs of smokers, restaurants can allocate small outdoor areas for smoking. However, such smoking areas should not be available very easily if the government is trying to discourage smoking on a country level. ",B1
"I don't believe that every college student should have a part-time job. It is not necessarily important, because what are important are your studies. As a college student, I think having a job, even though it's part-time, will just distract students and it might be a reason for us to get low grades. I 'm not saying that we're not supposed to have a job. It still depends whether the student can balance his/her time studying and working at the same time. But we should also consider the capabilities of the student and their study habit. If they are not very good when it comes to their academic standing, it is not recommended for them to enter a job. But if they love to study, and at the same time help their parents regarding their tuition fees, then I think it is just fine. Some students are already having a hard time balancing their times when it comes to studying, so I really think that the companies or the employees should know first the reason why they want to work, and also know how they do in school. Because before a student can be a good employee, he/she must learn everything they have to know in school.",B1
"Smoking is a bad habit, but it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it would also affect others' health, however, if we advocate no smoking in all the restaurants in country, does anybody think of the chain-smokers? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, it's so hard to ask them quit smoking habit in short time. So, if all the restaurants ban the smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen at last? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking place or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking, the action doesn't encourage people to smoke, it just offer some room for smokers to relax temporally. A chain-smoker will be unhappy without smoking, and who wants to see somebody having a long face when enjoying meal at restaurants? In conclusion, setting up smoking places is better than banning smoking at all restaurants, the former may be a better policy and be reciprocal for all the restaurants, costumers and smokers.",B1
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places such as a restaurant, station, theater and college because cigarette smoke includes poison which is dangerous for people's health. And the people near smokers are also harmed by the poison of the cigarette smoke. I think there are three important things when the smoking problems are discussed. First, passive smoking has bad influence on our health. Moreover, it's more dangerous than smoking directly. Smokers might be prepared for the bad smoking influence and give up the idea of keeping their health. But passive smokers never think so. Most of them probably want to keep their health and enjoy their life for a long time. If a woman is pregnant, she should not smoke without question. And the people near her should pay attention to the situation of smoking. It is also dangerous for a baby to breath in the cigarette smoke. Second, habitual smoking needs a lot of money. So stopping smoking will solve the problem of a family budget. Now, the government in Japan plans a large increase in some kinds of taxes. If habitual smoking is improved, we might overcome such severe situation of a family budget. I think that stopping smoking is to family advantage. Third, heavy smokers, the people who smoke a lot every day, always have the risk of lung cancer. I have seen the picture of a lung suffered from nicotine. It showed that the lug turned from vivid pink to black by the influence of nicotine. The picture really shocked me. So, I don't smoke now and won't do in the future. After all, it doesn't profit us to smoke. Smoking harms both smokers and nonsmokers seriously. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.",A2
"In college, students want to find something to do to have the new experience and money. There are many ways to find something to do and the best one is part time job. It is good for students to do the part time job because it will make the students get more experiences, students will earn money, and they may have the opportunities to get the job in future. Firstly, it is good for students to do the part time jobs because students will get more experiences. When students have to do the jobs, they will face many situations from consumers and the boss of them. They will have more patients and learn more to live with others in societies. Secondly, students will earn more money while they are learning. Part time job makes money for students too. Student will know the value of money and how hard they find them. From this, they will know how to use money and they will have money if they have to use it. Finally, another reason why it is good for students to have a part time job is they might get more opportunities for their works in future. If students work, they will meet many people. In addition, if the agency finds that this student is good at working, they can remember your name and reserve this student for doing the job when this student graduates. All in all, the students might strongly believe that to do the part time job is necessary and important. Because part time job can give more experiences, make money, and provide more opportunities for student in the future.",B1
"These are advertisements to announce the job. I think they will be interested by unemployed or person who would like to get more earnings. I was interested once time when I aspired something and I need to buy by myself. So I asked my uncle for permission, he rejected me. I have canceled my attention to part time job. He told me that I should attend only in my class. But my older brother can do! My older brother did a part time job at Mcdonald's, he enjoyed his job. At the beginning he complained about his job and he looked so tired. Later he had narratives, he told me daily. I listened him, I feel so fun, too. And he talked to foreign in work. That's great experience for him to develop his language. I think the reasons for doing part time job other than getting the earning are finding more experience by own self and using the free time in good way. I see a lot of advantages from part time job despite I ever haven't done it. If I work in part time, I will got various things: the earnings, experience from own self and other people, friendship from workmates. I just want a chance to try to do something by myself.",B1
"I do not agree to smoke. Smoking is a harmful for our health. In addition, people who smoke to people around the damage. Smoking in public places, especially those doing is not very good. We all should be non-smoking. My friends smoke. However, even have a bad view Harmful to the skin. And for women to get pregnancy, a lot of trouble. Nowadays, even a cigarette box, it says can be harmful to your health. But people should ignore it. To solve this problem, the first campaign in the country. For example illustrates the case of smoking patients. The second risk is notified. Cigarette box larger text should be written. Third the price increase should be. The more expensive will reduce tobacco consumption. And these days there is a problem of youth smoking. Monitoring and management in schools should be more thorough.

"Part time jobs are some time done by people to get more income, as the money is very important and necessary for the people to live a life. As this is a very tough time age, so the things are very costly. Every body is worried due to this problem so they cannot live peacefully in this age. For meet their expenses they do part time job. But in part time job they miss the happiness and joy of family and neighbours and relatives. It also disturbs their health as doing working all the day is not good for health. When they working all the day without any rest then definitely it is not good for their health and family. So part time job is equally useful and harmful. When the students are doing part time jobs then they are trying to earn more for their study issues in this way they help their parents but this things disturbs their study issues. So they fail in the exam. Or sometimes they waste their positions. Part time jobs are not liked in our country because in our country there is no culture of hard working. People are not doing their original jobs so how they can do extra jobs.",B1
"These days, many people are smoking. In our school case, many students are smoking in everywhere. I think smoking gives other people a lot of damage. Because for those who do not smoke gives damage. Than direct smoking, passive smoking is not good for person's body. And smoking is weakened breathing smoke fitness comes the hard mucus. In the body always messy and the smell of smoke around people who smell give offense. When smoking first cigarette, but the mind being stable in the future after 4-5 years will grow to be unconscious. The damage is greater financially. I can't feel the taste of food smells the scent is can't. However, if a cigarette for a week to break the food is really delicious and very fresh air becomes when the smoking, the amount of nicotine increases in the body. Increasing the amount of nicotine has adverse effects occur. Adverse effects of body movement arose in the case of pregnant women to reduce blood flow to the placenta is interrupted. First cigarette smoke or too much light when opened! Vomiting, dizziness, a headache, because the nicotine to paralyze the nerves. Therefore smoking increases the incidence of end liver and lung cancer gets worse because the body is not good",B1
"For me. I think who students have a part-time job are good and diligent. They can help their parents about money or use their earnings for buy something which they want. Moreover they receive important experience about life in real world and they can learn something about solving the problem. Student can do work whatever they want to do. Such as work in library, restaurant and work with computer. Working of college students is good but if they can't divide time well. IT is going to they can't succeed in learning and everything. Working should have rules such as working on Saturday and Sunday. In day must to learn should more intend. Some people can success from working with learning but some people can't do it so that students should look their self that they can do a part-time job but it isn't effect to learning is terrible. It is very good for people who haven't money or want to help people in family but they must adjust time well. However if they think they want to help parents that they are very glad and students don't work only. They can do housework, intend learning. Finally every student has to good people of social.",B1
"I agree with the idea that we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, smokers have the right to smoke, but they should not smoke in the place which smokers may trouble other people. Especially when other people are eating, the smoke makes other people have unwillingness to eat. I change my seat if there is smoker near me when I am eating. Besides, there is another problem. In the restaurant, there is place for smokers and for non smokers. We can choose the room we like to sit down, but in the almost all restaurants, there is nothing to have smoke kept in the room for smokers. As a result, the smoke comes to the room for non smokers. It is obvious that choosing the room is meaningless. Furthermore, cigarette smoke harm people who do not smoke. There are many researches which improve cigarette smoke will cause many kinds of illnesses. It can cause cancer which may kill people. Some foreign countries have already started to ban the cigarette in the public, such as school, station, airport and also restaurant. Japan has to ban smoking at all restaurants, too.",B2
"Smoking is very harmful for our body but many people smoke. Smoking People says that it can be forgetting our stress because the cigarette is very bitter.

Smoking is very bitter and harmful for our body. There are many maÃ®tre cancer genes in cigarette. So, I don't like smoking. In Korea, the age of smoking is 19. Minor cannot smoke and buy the cigarette. In the restaurant, there is non - smoke area for non - smoking people. So, whenever I go to the restaurant I sit in non - smoking area because I hate smoking. The sex rate of smoking is woman's rate is less then man's rate. But, theasedays, many women smoke in anywhere.

"To claim that something is important, it means to say that the thing is a priority in the individual's life. However, I feel that the main responsibility of a college student is to study, and not to earn money. Hence, I would refrain from saying that having a part-time job is necessarily important. Having a part-time job is only important in some scenarios. As college tuition can be very expensive, some students find themselves having to work part-time in order to pay for their college tuition. In this case, having a part-time job would be a priority to the individual, as without the salary earned from the part-time job, the individual would be unable to pay college tuition and attend college. However, while not important in most other cases, having a part-time job can still be beneficial. The salary earned from part-time jobs allows college students a certain amount of financial autonomy and teaches them independence. Besides, earning a little extra pocket money never hurts. College students who have to juggle both studies and part-time work are also trained to have good time management. This is a useful skill to learn in life. In addition, the part-time job contributes to the individual's work experience, and is a good chance for the individual to learn about workforce etiquette. In conclusion, having a part-time job is only important in some situations, not all. But even if not important, the individual might still want to consider taking up part-time work so long as one can cope with the demands of both studies and work due to the various benefits that one might stand to gain.

"In my opinion, it is important for university students to have a part-time job. The reasons which support my point of view are as follow. To start with, having a part-time job can help students to improve their time management skill. Since college students are all adult, it is vital for them to learn how to maintain balance between study and work. I believe none of the future employers would like to employ anybody who has trouble with their schedule. Getting a part-time job, students can be partially financial independent from their family. It is a good idea for students to share the financial burden for their families. They should show their responsibilities to their families, and this is the way they can be more mature and responsible. In addition, students can learn some soft skills such as communication skill during the time they are doing the part-time jobs, which cannot be learnt from any textbooks or from schools. Some may argue that if students are getting a part-time job, they may lose their relaxation time or time to be with their friends and family. However, there are two faces of a coin; scarification is a must when you want to have both things done. That is the reason why time management is one of the important skills students should learn from the job. To conclude, it is a wonderful idea of college students getting a part-time job as they can gain a lot from it no matter soft skills or personal development.",B1
"As we know, smoking is not only harmful to people's health but also to the environment. Smoking can deal to many diseases, such as the cancer of lung and so on. So it is very important and necessary to stop people from smoking in public place, especially in all restaurants. There is 3 reasons for that. The first one is, restaurants are the public places that people have meals, so keep the air clean is a duty of everyone. Smoking can generate dirty smoke to pollution the surrounding air. There are a lot of harmful substances in the smoke, it is no doubt the harmful substances will sticky on food and then they will be eaten by people. So you can imagine how unhealthy the food. I think no people will like this environment when eating. Secondly. What more serious is, the people sit around the smokers have to breath the second-handed smoke, that more harmful to their health than the smokers'. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So smokers should think more about the other people, should not build their habit over others' health. All in all, I am agreed with the government ban smoking completely at all restaurants in the country.",B1
"I think that college students should have a part-time job. Because college students can obtain great deal of experience by having part-time. It can know the importance of the thing to earn money. The chance that it meets various people increases, too. Actually, knowing the importance of money, and doing a useless shopping disappeared as for me after it began to having part time. Moreover, I was able to make friends a lot with the people. I was able to make friends with the people of various universities. It is really happy to speak friends of various universities with various topics. It is planned to travel to various places with the friends who happily because it because it works part-time, and to make a lot of memories. I think that it should experience these things before it starts one's adult life. It can be thought that the part-time job is a practice before it finds employment. I think that it is very important to experience the part-time job in the school days for the above-mentioned reasons. Moreover, I think it is necessary. If the part-time job was not experienced, I was housebound. The part-time job develops the person, and gives me a lot of valuable experiences.

"Smoking In my opinion, I think the meaning of smoking is behavior that most people do but they don't know it be hateful. Everyone may be doubt, why I said that ? but be patient, I'll explain you. According to my opinion, I think smoking is nasty because smoking not only annoys yourself but also everyone around you ;moreover, It's disadvantage for your life but everyone's life because Toxins in cigarette can make an impact for smoker such as Nicotine can make you addicted to them, Tar contains many substances coalesce brown, it cause color stain on your finger and teeth. And Carbon monoxide can make you lack of oxygen and numb etc. According to many reasons that I said, I think smoking should be completely banned in everyplace that have a lot of people. because if you don't ban, it will make many disadvantage more for person who don't smoke. If you don't want to be a person that everyone don't want to approach, just try to follow this. First thing you shouldn't drink alcohol because it'll stimulate you and make you smoke again. Second thing drink water 6-8 glasses per day because water will eliminate nicotine in your health. Finally, it's how to quit smoking a lot but you must do everything with your heart, do with your heart, just this, you'll be one person that can quit smoking as well.",B1
"Part time job is one way of earning a living either additional income or to suffice the needs of everyone. Part time jobs is very common to those whose earning is not enough that's why they were force to do part time jobs. Also doing part time jobs is a big advantage more often to the students cause while studying at the same time having a part time job gives them more training and were able to experience how to earn a living. My father encouraged me last vacation to do part time job at any food chain but I refused for reason of laziness and I don't like any hard work, but as I think it over carefully, my father was right, not for financial shortages reasons but for a reason of learning how to earn a living and how to treasure each and every cents we have. My father wants me to realize the hardships of how to earn a living in which in the end would give more benefits in general. I do hope that by next vacation, I could find a part time job so that I can experience also at my early age on how to earn a living and at the same time how to treasure every cents I have on my pocket, at any reasons it is beneficial not only on my part but also to my whole family. I admired those students who are doing part time jobs cause it's a big help to their parents as well as it gives them experiences on how to earn a living. Also, once a student graduated and having an experience of being a student and at same time doing part time jobs is an edged or advantaged in applying for a job.",B1
"I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Being a college student requires a certain level of commitment towards academia and the decision to be enrolled in a college already somewhat sets some kind of priority that education should be more important above anything else such as having a part-time job. A reason why someone would attend college is so that they can attain a degree in order to secure better future job prospects. Having a part-time job is not only time-consuming but usually requires effort too and would be physically tiring. This would affect the student's concentration and focus in school when both college and part-time job workload takes its toll on the student. Also, there's a lack of time for the student to sufficiently study and revise what is taught. Thus, students should focus on the long-term goal of obtaining a good degree rather than be lured by extra pocket money offered by part-time jobs. Of course, there is the argument that some college students are good at time management and can juggle school and their part-time job well. Although this might be the case for a select number of students, I still feel that having a part-time job is not important. I feel that the only exception whereby part-time jobs can be seen as important for college students is that if the part-time job they take up is for work experience or research purposes that are related to what they are pursuing in college. Hence, a part-time job may be important only if it is for internship purposes. Otherwise, a part-time job should not be a priority or seen as important for college students. ",B1
"I think I will completely agree in this topic that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In recently years, our law-making officials had made the law concerning people who want to smoke should not smoke in the public place passed, and at that time, some people were happy, some were not. Because the law may help some people escape from the second-hand smoking, but it also makes people smoking very inconvenient and shops selling smoking will lose some customers. Although there are something argued by the people want smoking, I believe the benefits will much better than bad. Because it maybe help some people who want to stop smoking make a determination to quit smoking, and maybe it can save more people from getting lung cancers. And just as the topic says it is necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants, because when we are having a meal, we are also enjoying the tastes and smelling, but if someone start to smoke, then the smoking fogging will be full of the space, and needless to say, it is hard for everyone. So I hope there will have more people to quit smoking.",B1
"I agree with banning smoking in restaurants because it might negatively impact of the atmosphere in the restaurant. Besides, cigarette smoke makes no harm to the body that are the ones who smoke and those around. Causing many diseases have come followed such as cancer, heart attract. The shop should be held the policy or campaign for banning smoking. If all restaurants cooperate with each other, the number of smokers will drop down and all is gone at the end. In school, there should be a campaign also to teach students to not try to smoke. The teachers may show the pictures about people who got effects from smoking. Students may discuss how smoking is dangerous or how it harms people. They may discuss about advantages and disadvantages. Then they may see the results how less advantages they can think of smoking and how amount of effects from smoking they found. It is not only restaurants to decide to ban the smoking, the country should support them too. If the government support, it will be stronger and people will follow without argument. It is another suggestion to promote banning smoking in all restaurants. Someone should start this campaign as soon as possible.",A2
"Smoking, it's not extremely good for the public. It's should be banned for many public places where too many people are there. Because when one smokes, the others who don't smoke may be unsatisfied. The place where the smoking should be banned for the first place is restaurant. There are many restaurants where the smoking can be allowed. In my opinion, there are many reasons that it should not be allowed although that restaurant has the smoking area. When one smokes the cigar, it's sure that it will have too much of smoke in the air. The smoke can be in the air and can through from the smoking area to the inside of the restaurant where too many people are having their food. The smoke of the cigar can be caused of unhealthy, especially for the very little children, anyone who has the problems about the respiratory system, or an old people. They are too little to breathe the smoke and too unhealthy. It isn't good image for the restaurant. When the smoking can be allowed in the restaurant, that restaurant may be missed the clients because of disliking of the personality. He may dislike the smoking of his reason, so he doesn't want com into the restaurant where the smoking be allowed. The smoking isn't good for the public, for example in the because of many reasons, such as unhealthy, image or the reason of the personality and so on. Therefore; it shouldn't be allowed.",B1
" People used to regard the main target of students was to study, while this notion has changed greatly that part-time job can bring benefits in many aspects. So nowadays an increasing number of students are taking up part-time jobs. Seen from my own experience, the advantages of part-time jobs can be concluded into two main aspects. First, the experience of a part-time job can be of great help when you start you career as you have already acquired the skill to handle the emergency independently. And you can get in the society earlier than your peers and learn how to deal with the interpersonal relationship. When you offer an application, the working experience can be your bright points. Second, the reward of a part-time job may not be so high but it is undoubtedly your first pot of gold, which is of great meaning throughout you life. The feeling of spending money earned by yourself differs a lot from spending the pocket money given by parents. It gives you a sense of pride that all that you have done has been acknowledged and appreciated, and it can also silently teach you how to treasure every penny. So, it's not surprising to see he rising percentage of part-time job takers in the campus. To everyone, it is an irreplaceable experience which brings nothing but benefits.",B1
"Students are the nation builder. And especially the students of college which are going through the most serious age of their education have many difficulties. The difficulties only for those student who come from the poor family and from the middle class family. In the poor family there is only one sole breeder of their family on which whole family depends so they mostly like that not to give education to their children. But the mostly it is taken into consideration that these students are mostly interested into their student. So they for their studies start part time jobs to meet their needs in the studies. The part time jobs are not bad because they come to know how to make their nation strong with these hardworking students of the country. Due to this part time job there is also bad effect on their studies they do not need much time to do their self-studies. There health is also disturbed that they do not need any time to take rest. Government should take the serious action on this dominating issue, because in this stage of life of students they are selecting their professions government should offer different funds for these poor people so that they do not consider the difficulties as a stumbling blocks in their path. These students gained confidence and become true citizens of their nation.",B1
"I think that it would do the world of good if all students took on a part-time job while at college or university. I do have one caveat though and that is, that colleges should also provide some form of counselling or advice that would assist with preparing students in managing their time and their mind set, before going off in search of work. It always sounds easy to get a part-time job however, getting one and then keeping it while maintaining the required study levels is easier said than done for many students and they do struggle with it. Admittedly, there are a few students who handle both easily and without any apparent issues but in my opinion, these students are already in possession of the correct mindset and organisational skills or have learned them very quickly. For those with less experience, this may not be the case and I feel quite strongly that it is a lot easier to prepare than repair as the saying goes. Given the right preparation, all students should be able to combine both activities without mishap and also with the minimum of stress. This would allow them to not only enjoy the benefits of earning a wage but to also progress with their studies in a more relaxed and conducive frame of mind.",C2
"It is of great significance that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When I was young, I was taught with a picture that lungs were covered with soot. The statement that smoking is harmful to our physical health has been deeply rooted in my mind since then. There are many poisonous elements such as nicotine in a cigarette, and when it burns, it may produce carbon monoxide. Now, when more and more people of my age start to smoke and persuade me to smoke, I just smile and refuse. However, there are also some advantages of smoking regardless of the side effects. Smoking can help one to calm down when facing difficult situations. A famous example is the detective Sherlock Holmes, he always hold a pipe in his mouth while thinking about the case. In public places such as restaurant, however, despite the advantages, smoking should be banned furthermore. To some people, they do not like smoking, and they will absorb poisonous smoke passively and unwillingly if someone smokes at restaurant. To pregnant women, smoke is even more harmful. Since not all smoke, I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"There is not benefit. Ads for cigarettes were all over the place. Today we're more aware about how bad smoking is for our health. Smoking is restricted or banned in almost all public places and cigarette companies are no longer allowed to advertise on TV, radio, and in many magazines. Almost everyone knows that smoking causes cancer, emphysema, and heart disease; that it can shorten your life by 10 years or more; and that the habit can cost a smoker thousands of dollars a year. So how come people are still lighting up? The answer, in a word, is addiction. The consequences of this poisoning happen gradually. Over the long term, smoking leads people to develop health problems like heart disease, stroke, and many types of cancer. Smoking is a hard habit to break because tobacco contains nicotine, which is highly addictive. Like heroin or other addictive drugs, the body and mind quickly become so used to the nicotine in cigarettes that a person needs to have it just to feel normal. Why smoke? I can understand. Especially I hate people smoking in the street. Smoke on the road is one thing that is harmful to the people around you. Although all people do not quit smoking. Smokers need some kind of etiquette training.",A2
"Smoking has been known to be very harmful to respiratory organs, and it is pointed as the main cause of cancer. However, tens of thousands of people are smoking still, because they have been addicted already. Thus, it is important to provide a strong opportunity to quit the smoking. People are smoking to relieve their stress, but it's not the good solution because it can bring the bigger problem like lung cancer. Further, it can harm to other people who don't smoke, because when smoking people breathing out, the ingredients contained in the smoke can affect the other people. In other word, people can die for smoking. However, the problem is that it is not easy to quit the cigarette. How can we pull them up from smoking? How can we save them from smoking? We can use the strategy of punish, and one of punish can be banning smoke at all the restaurants in the country. It can decrease the chances of smoke happening, because they will pay a pretty penny when they don't follow the regulation. Helping them by banning the smoke seems too progressive, but it could be an appropriate solution to help them move out from the addiction. Moreover, we can use the fine collected from the smokers to help other poor people. In sum, I agree to make a restrict zone in our life zone.",B2
" My many college students are doing a part-time job. Some of them usually spend one day working outside on the weekends. Others often do this as possible as they have free time. I am also looking for a part-time job. I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. Firstly, we are still studying and we have no career. We ask our parents for money. If we take a part-time job. we will have extra money, which not only reduces our parents' pressure, but also gives us more choices to buy things we want. Secondly, doing a part-time job is a challenge for us, because we are studying in school now and we have not constructed with the society. Doing a part-time job can aboarden our horizon and we will have a better understanding of our future jobs. In addition to this, we can know the rule in the job field ahead. The last point is that doing a part-time job give us a good opportunity to make more friends, which is very important for us to development better. In a conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, doing a part-time job has a lot of benefits: Our abilities are improved and we are becoming denpendent and so on. We only need deal with the relationship between study and the job well.",B1
"I am a non smoker. And I very, very, very hate a smell of the smoke. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also I love to cook. If someone smoke in my beside when I cooking, I will kick his face. I specially think that cooking is very holy. If smoke invades cooking Oh, no! That is vet terrible. Today smokers are very many. High school students, middle school students, girls and woman even my dog too? I feel to the many smokers. Clearly I do not hate them. Just I don't understand them and I curse a smoking. But finally I have to admit to them. Because many various people exist in the world. But I tell that it is need to another smoking place for the both of smoker and non smoker. The restaurants are too. I imagine that smoking place out of restaurants. Then smoking is not damage for cooking. I can't oppose the smoking completely. Because I don't understand every people in the society. Someone also does not understand me. Society will to try to understand with each other. For happy life of everybody. I think that is the heaven in the earth.",A2
"A part time job serves as a good chance for students to learn how to socialize with other people. As a matter of fact, throughout their education from elementary school to college, students tend to learn knowledge rather than how to cope with others in the society. Although they become friends with peers, that is probably possible thanks to the environment that makes them face each other for a long time. In addition, students are likely to be of similar age, socio-economic background, or interest. In contrast, in the professional world that we enter after college, we are bound to encounter people from different backgrounds and cope with people who are higher in status according to the hierarchical system. For this reason, we are apt to face difficulties getting along with colleagues or bosses. Viewed in this light, if college students do part time jobs, they can experience in advance how the real society functions and how to treat coworkers. For example, working with colleagues, they can learn a sense of cooperation and responsibility, and communicating with bosses, they can learn ways to show respect, using appropriate register. Therefore, it is necessary that college students have a part time job, as that experience teaches them social skills which is necessary for their future career.",B2
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country in terms of the health of the customers and the benefit of the restaurants. First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking area and non-smoking area are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in non-smoking area end up with receiving the second hand smoke. It is said that the second hand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than first hand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harm customers in a both physical and mental way. Second, smoking does harm to the benefit of the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed whether completely or partially. In fact, when I chose a restaurant, I try not to enter the restaurant which does not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friend and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers less customers than if it banned smoking. This leads to the less benefit of the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely.",B2
"Part time job are some work that we pick for finding some money or used for experience. I think it is called Part time job because the job is not our main job; it is only for extra time we have, and we got some money for it. I think there are two meanings of part time job, first is the job that you pick because you don't have money for looking a real job, it can be your time are used for your school or college, maybe you have some practice to do, in my country, some college have the night class that called Kelas malam, that night class is used for students that don't have time for studying in regular class, maybe the students have some work to do, and that work I called part time job. The second meaning is job that you picked second, and of course the job are not your main job. Let me tell you example, if someone have started a job, it can be he work as a employee in office, and he realize that the salary that he got is not enough for his family life, he will find some money again, and he find a job that called a part time job that I mean.",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In the beginning, everybody knows that smoking is a bad habit which will harm the health of body, so, there are many rules that not allow people smoke in public area. But as we can see, there are still many people cannot help to smoke, no matter in public area or not, whatever. Sometimes I think that is because when there are people smoking in restaurant, no one would jump out to stop them not to do so. I think if the rule could be made more strictly, even completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, maybe people who like to smoke would be forced to change their minds, and also their smoking habit. Also, restaurants are usually in a closed area, that is, if there are people smoking, the air in restaurants would be become awful very quickly. However, I think that would be a very difficult rule to be bring out successfully because there are too many restaurants, and, it would be also a tough work to define all the restaurants, or it is just also the ""vendor"". Those are why I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"Many restaurants separated smoking area from not smoking area in Japan. But The separation of smoking area is not done completely. Therefore, even if we have lunch or dinner in not smoking area in a restaurant, we sometimes feel unpleasantness for smoking. But it is not good to prohibit smoking perfectly. Perfect prohibition of smoking will cause decreasing of profit from selling cigarette. The rate of smoking person in Japan is big compared to some other advanced country. And young smoking people increase these days. So, if smoking is banned, people who come to the restaurant and sales of cigarette will decrease. This decreasing is severe for many restaurants and Japan. Because, cigarette is one of important source of tax. Of course, separation of smoking area must be done more surely and smoking people may be needed for good smoking manner. Because a thought that passive smoking is bad for health of people who are surrounding smoker is spreaded all over Japan. However, many people believe this thought whether it is correct or not, they don't think that smoking must be prohibited unless they are in danger ob passive smoking. As far as the separation of smoking area is completely done, I think that smoking need not to be banned.",B1
" Smoking is a kind of annoyed behavior in the eyes of the people who don't smoke. Why are people smoke? I think some people find tobacco can let him or her excited after smoking, Other people think smoking stands for cool and wealthy, there is an another reason, the people who was under the great pressure want to find a way to reduce it. However, Smoking is an unhealth behavior which bring a lot harmful not only smoker itself but other people stay nearby. When I smell the smoke I feels headache, so, I hate someone smokes besides me. I think there are lots of people feel strongly annoyed when someone smoking in public. Nowadays, many countries have set the law to prevent the rights of people who doesn't smoke. The law says no smoking in public, if you wants to smoke, you must be alone without anyone nearby or go to the smoking zoom. I think this law indicate that more and more people desire a clean environment. One more rules between human being is when you do something yourself you can't make trouble to other people, otherwise the society would turn into upset&down. Do not smoke in the public I think is important both to society and citizens, which could made great process to the civilization of human being.",B1
"Students in high school and college take part-time jobs for a lot of reasons. It may possibly be for the needs of the students to earn a lot of money because of financial problems and so that they can pay fees for their schools. While other students need to work only to make their life easier; they wouldn't worry that much in purchasing a large amount for foods, school supplies, rents and bills especially if they earn a lot of money from their job. On the other side, some students work for part time jobs for what their pleasure needs; students can do and buy whatever they want when they have saved up enough money from their job, like purchasing belongings like clothing and gadgets or just to spend money for computer games, movies, concert or marathon tickets, vices, and etc. Students working for part-time job not just provide money, but it will also help them learn and improve their skills. Part-time job is also a preparation for teenagers for adult life. One preparation is communication skills. Students are more exposed into dealing with different people; it's a matter of how you are cautious and careful with your words and how you show respect to people. Another preparation is the importance of responsibility. Anything they do will be observed and assessed, so they tend to work harder and do their best in everything they do. And lastly, is learning how hard money is earned. It takes a lot of patience and hardwork to obtain a lot of money. Students must not take advantage of it and appreciate the value of money. Indeed, students who take part-time jobs not just only obtain money, they also obtain skills that can develop them into better employees in the future.",B1
"In today's society, more and more college students have part time job after school. In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time. Part time job is essential for students as part time job makes a student more active, gives some experiences and student can earn some pocket money. Part time job is defined when students do some job besides their study so that they can able spend their leisure time properly. For an example, students cannot keep themselves busy all the time. Sometimes they take some time for relaxing or spending leisure period. There are some students who get bored spending more leisure periods. So for them to be alive they start to take a job for spending their leisure. As a result they become more active in their daily life and get more concern about their study too. Sometimes part time job gives a student some experiences. It is true before getting a permanent job or big job every people should have to get experiences about what they will going to be do in future. For an example, students are given some offers for internship before graduating from university. That internship is kind of part time job which give students some experiences for their future job. The one of most profitable for student is pocket money. Students those are doing part time job they can earn some money so sometimes they don't have to ask their parents for giving them some money. If students take a job for part time, continue that job so they can able to achieve profit in different ways. At the end they will become more efficient, more perfect and more profitable in their future life.",B1
"To be honest, I feel strongly that smoking is really a bad behavior for any human, and smoking should be completely banned whole world. In spite of smoking may hurt health who smoke, but there still a lot of people like smoking today, they do not think this behavior is a serious problem, and they enjoy the feeling of smoking. Some said that smoking can reduce stress; some think that smoking can relieve anxiety moods, and other think that smoking can refresh themselves. Today smoking is around the world, not only among the old and the men people, but also among the youth and the women people, smoking is getting more and more serious problem. Restaurant is the place people eat and chat there, and enjoy the delicious foods there. Some of the restaurant almost is airtight place, in particular there have air conditioner in it, if someone smoke in the place may caused the air not fresh and everyone mat smell the bad air. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all of the restaurants public place and work place. The smoker should not smoke in the place where banned smoking. In order to keep your family healthy and the world's health, that all of the smoker should get rid of smoking behavior. It is not only good for themselves but also good for everyone in the world.",B1
"Smoking in restraints should be banned completely in Japan. There are three reasons why I think so. First, it's for people who don't smoke. The smoke from the top of the cigarettes is more harmful than that which goes into smoker. So, No matter how careful people make minds not to smoke, the risk of cancer doesn't decrease. Why do we have to suffer from the risk? I can't understand. Secondly, it's for people who manage the restraints. The smoke from cigarettes contains factors which cause troubles in the restraints. The white wall turns brown gradually and the color of the wall makes the restraint's impression bad. Managers have to pay money to change wallpaper. The smoke also damages machines like air conditioner or air cleaner. The damaged filter in the machine is no longer available. Thirdly, the most important reason, it's for people who smoke heavily. As you can see, smokers should stop smoking and some people try to do it. But it is so difficult once he/she start to smoke. So we have to support them to make society comfortable for the people who want to stop smoking. As the activity, it's necessary to ban smoking and stop smoker thinking I want to smoke.",B1
"In our country there are more and more college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's becoming quite common to see students busy running errands after lessons. Some say colleges students are expected to do concentrate on studying, because study is just like their jobs. However I think it's a good thing for college students to take a part-time job while studying. Although it is a truth that for a college student, his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations, it surely does not need to be the only target. In fact, college life which consists of only study is not balanced and may cause the student to miss out on other valuable learning experiences. In addition to bringing more balance to a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. He will have the precious opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced with a wider variety of problems to solve. Furthermore, work helps a student to develop greater independence, and earning his own pocket money can teach him how to handle his finances. Finally, a part-time job can help a student to develop a greater sense of responsibility and team-work spirit, both for his own work and for that of the team he works with. For all of these reasons above, I firmly believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college. Of course, they must be careful not to let it take up too much of their time because study is still their primary responsibility. To sum up, living a balanced life is the best way to be successful.",B1
"I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. It may not always be easy to find spare time to get a job on top of all the school work. Sometimes it may even feel overwhelming for us to keep up with our busy schedule. However I believe it is critical for us as college students to have a part time job since it helps us to be more responsible in our actions. It not only helps us to be more conscientious in our spending but also allows us to be more alert to use our time more efficiently. If we earn our own money, we will be more careful in our spending too. It is true that harder we earn our money it is less likely that we waste or spend it easily on unnecessary items. Moreover, it is our responsibility to be more dependent as we get older. If we don't earn our money and just get it from our parents, it will get harder and harder for us to be independent. As a process of growing up and maturing, we need to have our own standards and values set properly and I believe that having a part time job while we are in school helps the process.",A2
"Most people earn part time job for earn extra money and it good that student do the part time job to get extra money. Because, it is the way to collects experience and money while studying in college or university. I strongly agree with doing part time job while studying for learning about the way to work with another person in the future. In the future when work with another people, it normally to receive co-worker emotion because most people start the career by becoming an employee so they will receive many emotion of co-worker. It is the thing that cannot avoid and must endure. For example, when an employee make president of enterprise get mad, it is not good to him if he against his leader maybe he will be fire. The way to prevent this situation is doing best in job and make a good understanding with all of co-worker. all of this is the good beginning for career in the future. It is good to planning the career in the future and practicing it since being student. For example, someone who want to have own cafÃ© shop then he get part time job about cafÃ©. This is the way to planning the part time job in part of career in the future.",B1

"Part time job is a job that student worked in a part of the day or week. Usually people who have part time job are the college students. It is important for college students to have a part time job. It becomes important because the students will get a lot of benefits. First of all, the students will get the experience beside studying. So, they do not only get the theory, but also they can practice or learn much experience by getting a part time job. Second, the students will get more money. Actually, the college students need a lot of money. So, if they have part time job, they can help their parents. Therefore, they can save it for their future or if their parents are rich, they can use the money to buy something that they want. Third, the students can study to get a job.

"I agree with to do part-time job. Certainly, studying is the most important thing for students. But I think that it is important to do part-time job. There are many reasons to think that. First, we university students need money to spend full campus life. For example, we enjoy circle or club activity, study abroad, and buy textbooks with spending much money. Second, part-time job teach us a lot of rule of society. To earn money is difficult. So, it makes our spirit strong. Because of this, we must be responsible for our job when we do it. If we have a trouble in our job, we must not escape from there and we should make efforts to solve it. And part-time job teach us correct way of talking. So I think that part-time job is the best practice for a full-time job. Third, we university students must independent from our parents gradually. When we were high school students, we are totally dependent on our parents for food, clothing, and shelter. But some university students live alone. Then, they can't eat foods cooked by their mothers. Earning money to do part-time job is one of way to independent from their parents. So I think that it is important to do part-time job for university students.",B1
"Since some people need to focus on doing something such as full time students, housewives, they need money to sustain their living at the same time. They do not have enough time for them to work as a full-time worker. The best way to solve this problem is to do some part time job. Since working hour of part time jobs is more flexible and shorter in general, those people can earn money when they have time. Using full time university students as an example, many of them need lot of money not just the tuition fee but the gathering fee in order to keep up with their friends, however, students need to attend the classes. It is hard for them to find a full time job which fits their time-table, but having a part time job would fulfill what they want, they can earn money but do not conflict their study time. so part time job are beneficial to people, even though it would be a good choice for long time prospect, since employees of part time job usually do not have any welfare and people will not get higher salaries even doing for a long period already.",B1
"Nowadays, in China, there are more and more high school graduates entering colleges. This means that there will be more and more college graduates in need of jobs in the future. So I think it is important for our college students to have a part-time job. It is common in china that many college students spend most of their free time playing computer games or staying with their boy or girl friends. I think it is not wise to contribute most of our time to these things. We should make good use of our valuable time in that we may face fierce competition after graduation. So having a part-time job will help us a lot. As a college student, we live in school and contact with our classmates and teachers. We are not familiar with the society where we have to live and work in future. Having a part-time job can help us learn of the society and contact with more people, which can accumulate experience for us so that we can be more competitive in future. Having a part-time job can also let us feel how difficult it is for our parents to earn money, which can make us understand our parents better. To draw a conclusion, having a part-time job is an important lesson for us in college so everyone should try it.",B1
"I agree to the above argument. No smoking in restaurants and of course, common sense, you think that etiquette is to be guarded. Smoking makes people uncomfortable. The restaurant uses a lot of people. Therefore, should not smoke cigarettes. Unfortunately, people are vulnerable to the lure of tobacco smoking in restaurants are often smokers. The people do not feel well. In Korea, so many people smoke. As we know, smoking brings many harmful effects; especially teenagers and children affected these harmful effects easily than adults. Smoking is main cause of lung cancer. In addition, easy-to-hand smoke cigarettes cause cancer and smoking directly affects the poor more than anyone. A restaurant meal often come a lot of families. The children of the loop the smoke is harmful to health. Some smokers smoke in a restaurant to try to make sure that the most important. If there are smokers in a restaurant employee said this to prevent the smoke is also a good idea to ask. For smokers, even if their health should be non-smoking. Smoke-free restaurant should provide a good environment for guests. Nonsmoking is healthful and comfortable in a life. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is important",A2
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think that there are three reasons. At first, I think that college students should do what they want to do during school days. For example, studying abroad, traveling some countries, traveling Japanese, etc. If they do these things, they must grow up more than now. But they actually can not do these things. Because they do not have much money, they can not do these things. So they need a lot of money and must save for what they want to do. Second reason is to learn real societies. A lot of college students will work in offices. Then, if they do not know real societies, they can adapt themselves to real societies easily. So they need to have a part-time job. Third reason is to meet people of various generations. But almost all the people are not same generation with college students in real societies, they must work in offices. If they can experience to meet people of various generations during school days, they can adapt themselves to real societies. In other word, to have a part-time job is to gather experiences in real societies.",A2
"Personally, I do not think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The importance must be compared relative to something. Why is it important? Is it important because the student needs it to support himself and his family? Or is it important because the student needs to buy the upcoming Chanel bag? If it is the former, it will be considered important. Also, the student must also be able to make sure that he/she is able to deal with the amount of school work and have good time management before he/she decides to commit to a part-time job. For example, I had a part time job when I was in NUS year 1. I realized that my grades actually suffered for the first semester because I was too preoccupied with my part time job. Although it was a job at a bookstore and I enjoyed working there and interacting with my colleagues, I had to make a decision to quit the job. It was a job that was important to me because I do not receive any allowances from my parents, hence I had to make money on my own in order to purchase school books, afford transportation and daily expenses. Fortunately, I was eligible to apply for bursaries so my life is much easier. I can't wait to graduate so I can get a full time job and support my family! ",B1
"When I see this topic, first idea show up in my mind is that I disagree this statement. Nowadays, more and more college students get part-time job when they in school. Although college students have a part-time job is not bad. However, they need ability to get balance in the job and learning. They can get more experience and money from job, they can buy something they want, they also can build a good relationship in the work places, but having a part-time job is so time-costing, seldom of them can get a high grade in the final test. For example, my classmate in senior high school has a part-time job, since he spending more time in the job, he didn't study hard as before, his grade was getting bad. He asked me how to do and I just suggest him to give up the job. If he could not do it, he has no choice. To get balance in the job and learning, he did his best to get balance in the job and learning, but as time as he did, he started feeling so tired then he given up the job end up. After this event, his experience tells me that college students take care of their study in this time period is more important than get a part-time job.",B1
"If smoking can be allowed in the restaurants, I will point out some disadvantages for banning it. For example, when talking about smoking, we can imagine about the pictures in hospital that showing about people who died by lung cancer. The main factor is from smoking and they are very suffered. Smoking kills many people in each year and it seems that the number of people is increasing year by year. Even the government is trying to promote the policy to reduce smokers in the country but it seems that the policy isn't really successful. Not only smokers will get hurt from smoking but many people who smell the smoke also got effect. The results in many studies shows that the people who smell the smoke from cigarettes is taking risk rather than the smokers. They can easily die rather than the person who smoke. It is very interesting that the smokers can live longer than the person who got only smell. So, if it is possible, the smoking could be controlled in an appropriate places. All people should help the government to make this happen in order to save the world and people lives. One possible resolution is having a sign on the restaurants to tell all kind of customer that this place is not allowed to smoke, so customers can see and ready to act.",B1
"Before we begin on the topic of discussion, it is crucial to first identify the scope of the discussion topic, which will be limited to Singapore in order to facilitate the discussion to a more effective level that is familiar to me. In this case, a college student is assumed to be one that is currently studying in a junior college in Singapore, and based on my personal experiences and the experiences shared by my friends, I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, with reasons laying around how they will eventually affect the student from achieving their full-potential. Although college students can be argued to be able to pick up valuable life experiences in working from their part-time job, it is not crucial for them to work because they are not mature enough to handle situations at work which they may be exposed to. Also, having a part-time job can be argued to have detrimental effect on college students' grades should they not manage their time well. In fact, since a junior college is an express path that leads them to a university, it is crucial that they perform well enough to enter a university and a course of their choice that will ultimately decide their future career, so it is not essential for college students to get a part-time job but to perform their role as a student well.

"I think smoking shoud be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because I often enjoy smell and taste of dinner at restaurants, but smoke destroys ohteres happy dinner time. Many people who do not smoke don't like the tabacco's smell. The smell erase good smell of food. Many restaurants depart the seats for smoker and for not smoker, however, smoke cover large space and make many people, not smoker, feel worse and not appitite. So. searts deparetion have no sense. And when we sit a seat after smokers, we suffer from the bad smell which remind in the seat. Smoking is bad thing especially bad thing at places to eat food and used by many people. Many people have knew the fact the smoke include bad material which cause a lot of illness. We go to restaurants to eat delisious food, not to get illness. I think there are many people who like to smoke, but they can do out of restaurants too. Recentry, at many insturuments used by many people in Japan, smoking is banned. At a official place, they think other people. So, to enjoy lunch, smoking should be banned completely at restaurants.",B1
"Working part time in college is very important for many college students, I think. I think this because I have worked part time since I came to college, and it has given me a variety of good things. For example, I have been able to make a little bit of money for the weekends and other times. I can also use this money to help pay for my text books which my parents do not want to pay for. Next, I have been able to become smarter by working at my current part-time job. I have learned how to manage and maintain a computer system through my internship, and this is valuable experience that I could definitely use to help me find a real time job. This is just what I would like to be doing when I graduate, so unlike some students who work their part-time jobs at restaurants or other places, I am definitely not wasting my time. The one bad thing, however, is that as expected, I do sometimes have some problems balancing my school and work life. Really the biggest problem is that you meet new people at work and you can develop a new social circle there as well, and it is hard to have two main activities that you need to be doing (school and work) as well as two social circles which need your attention.",C2
"Smoking in public area has been a huge issue in our society for a long time, and because of that, it is becoming illegal in many countries in the world. As it is well known, smoking is bad for smoker himself, but also very harmful people near him. Even though it has been banned from many public areas, we still see people smoking in restaurants, where people eat, rests, and have a conversation. It is not right to smoke in restaurants, and it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Like I mentioned, smoking is harmful to people near, not just to smoker himself. It is found that secondhand smoking is more harmful than smoking. Smokers do not have right to harm non smokers, who are not happy to be harmed. Restaurant is a public place for everyone, and if people start to smoke, non smokers in the restaurant inevitably breathe all the harmfulness in the cigarette. That is why it should be banned. Let's say that there is a happy pregnant woman in the restaurant, having a meal and a conversation. If one person starts to smoke in the restaurant, he is harming the woman and a baby inside of her, and disturbing the happiness the pregnant woman enjoying in the meal. Is this something that should be happening?",A2
"Smoking should be banded in restaurants/hotels or not? I am totally agreed with this point of view but here the question arises that how can a act of an individual person is harmful for others. Every person is independent and in the whole world there is no law of interfering in one's personal life. But one's independence ends where his right starts. It's the responsibility of a person that his act will not harmful for others. everyone knows that smoking is less harmful for smoker or more harmful for the people sitting near him. In hotels or returners where people come for relaxation or enjoyment a smoker creates a bad impact. People dislikes him and teenagers attracts towards him, the craze of smoking develops in their minds. Smoker disturbs People by smoke while they are eating food or anything else. It also causes serious diseases. So what should we have to do in this situation? In this situation it is a responsibility of hotel management to make smoking rooms or band smoking in sitting or dinning hall. It's also the responsibility of government to assign security, police or special rangers to stop smoking in public places. It would be beneficial for our society.",A2
"There are many benefits of having a part-time job for college students, so I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. By having a part-time job, students are able to expand their set of skills and to expand the set of talents that they will use when they one day find a career. This is very important because if students cannot become skilled enough to find a fulltime job after they graduate, they will have wasted part of their lives in college. I agree that it is very important for college students to spend a lot of their time studying, but a few hours of part-time work every week shouldn't be so bad that students start to fail their classes and start cutting classes too. Therefore, any student who thinks that having a part-time job is a bad idea is simply afraid of having to work a little bit hard or to do some great things for himself. Many people have some strange psychological fear of success, and they allow this to impact their career and life choices as well as their level of happiness. So, buck up, find a part-time job, and start working your way to happiness today.",C2
"As we all know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. No smoking has become a dream of many people. Some businesses now say that no one can smoke cigarettes in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. This is a good idea though it takes away some of our freedom. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of In public places, the harm of smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous off into the air. Therefore, the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are strongly supporting it. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. What's more, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will surely be beneficial to all of us.",B1
"Nowadays, many people like to smoking. Even in the pubic, they also smoke. But in my eyes, that is a terrible thing and smoking should be strongly forbidden in the public. For smokers, smoking only can let them feel a bit relaxed in a short time. In the back of relaxness, so much bad influence are spreading in their body. The most widespread disease of smokers is lung cancer. Many smokers'lung like a black stone when examined. It has losed its pimary function to transport oxygen gas. So smokers are easily sudden died. A thing threatening one's life must should be forbidden. For the people around a smoker, many researches show that they are injured worse. It commomly be defined as Secondhand Smoke. It is unfair to them. They don't do anything, but they bear more harm. If those innocent people are you and you friends, can you tolerate it?For helping the innocent people, please smoker can quit smoking. For nature, smoking can discharge a lot of poisonous gas. It can damage the ozonosphere and lower the air quality. If we all like to smoke, the world must be totally destroyed. After that time, we would be regret about what we ever did. Now the world has many crisises. Of them, smoking plays a important role and cann't be ignore. Through smoking can result so mach terrible consequence, it should need to forbidden all over the world. In the near furture, all people hope to see a new world without cigarette. we everyone need do our best to realize our common dream.",B1
"Part time job is a job that needs fewer hours that full time job. Part time job can be seasonal or not. Some company hire more people in holiday to make sure the customer can be served. Like in Christmas, Independence day, etc. We can choose one from many kind of part time job. We can be a waiter, an assistant, baby sitter or even a teacher. College student usually get a part time job. It is very important and useful. College students can have a part time job, because they have flexible time from the university. So, they can match their time to go to college and another time to have part time job. Part time job is very useful for them. The first reason is the college student can spend their time to do something important. The second, part time job can make some many. So college student can have extra money for their needs like buy some clothes, pay car rental, buy some food, etc. The third is the college student can be more independent from their parent. The fourth is the college student can respect their things. They can use their money wisely because with working, they know that money is so hard to get. And the last is they will get more new experience.",B1
"Along with this era of globalization, the more diverse job. One of them is part time. Part time is a job, where we only work part time. One system that is working part-time employees working according to the desired clock so employees are paid based on hours worked. The longer he works the salary will be even greater. This is needed for those who want to work in the middle of the routine, so if he's unemployed to work. As we know to be able to college need the money that is not small. While our parents take great pains to work only to be happy for their children, for example by sending his son as high as possible so that later armed with such knowledge can be useful in the public eye and can make money from the science itself. But there are a few of the students wanted to pursue so that they can finance their needs very much, for example, lectures and other needs without having to burden the parents. Therefore, most types of employment are utilized by students who want to find money to finance their tuition, so they can go to college while working. It is very important to them because then they can assist parents in financing the needs of even their own college. In addition, by working part time they get valuable experience in addition to the lectures before they actually dive in the world of work.",B1
"The smoker can smoke in the area where they allow. Some area set up the symbol of banned smoking but some places do not set up it so some smoker will smoking in that areas and it will affect to others. A smoke will interrupt into the air and make an annoyed to people around not just annoying but it can make pollution spread into the air especially in the restaurants. Some restaurants have already set up the icon but some have not. In culture and common sense all people will know-well that in all restaurants should not be smoking because it will make bad feeling to other customers. Some smokers do not follow with the sign that cannot smoke so we should ban a smoking in the restaurants. Some customers do not like a smoke because they have bad effects to them. Some customers cannot enjoy their meal because of the smell. The government should make a law to completely ban the smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The government should be give heed the health of people because in this present people care about their health more than in the past, however the smoking is not good for everyone in anywhere not only all restaurant.",B1
"I agree with the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in country. This way is not respect for smoker. Smoker have a free of smoking. And we have not right to take away smoker's freedom. But the freedom need to responsibility. Smokeing is very not good our health. Smoke is very not good for health not only smoker but also non smoker. Smoking causes lung cancer and any other disease. If one smoker smoking in the restaurants, all the people in the restaurants are get a damage. Once the health is poor, then it is very hard to return to good. So smoker is not responsible at the smoking's damage. If the smoker have a lot of money, the health is don't change the money. And the smoking when you eating something is very unpleasent. So if you eating very delicious food where the smoker is smoking in restaurants, you not taste the food well. You will think just get off the smoking spot. I think the damage of non smokers is bigger then the discomfortable of the smokers. So the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Although they have discomfortable on the restaurants.",B2
"I do agree this topic because cigarettes can cause cancer such as lung cancer, mouth cancer etc. Smoking cigarettes also effect people surround the smoker. They will breathe it. The worse thing is why the second- hand smoker could have cancer too. In spite they never touch it. The people who often be around the smoker will get cancer without realizing it. So Is this fair? Especially in restaurants, there are many kind of age in restaurants, man, woman, boy, girl, pregnant and the elderly. So only one smoker can make ten people around there get cancer. The obvious effect, the smoker will disturb people in the restaurant for example it's difficult to breathe and eat or the smoke may be make you throw up not only eat food but also eat cancer too. If this policy work, people in the country will be more healthy you will eat without smoke, cancer will get away from you but this policy will not work if restaurant's owner don't help. It depend on everybody include the smoker. The government should release law of smoking. Strict law is also important too. Or the government may found the suitable place for the smoker. And I hope it will possible in the future.",B1
"I agree with this opinion It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think it is important to gain social experience by a part-time job. Because, many college students have lived in the limited relation of people that is called school. They don't know the large relations of people in the society. In it, there are many kinds of people. For example, people who help them or interfere them. In the school, if they think they don't like some people, they can avoid that one. But in the society, there are some cases that they can't avoid someone who they don't like. They can know it by a part-time job. I also think they can know the importance of money by having a part-time job. They have been given money from their parents. They don't know how hard earning money is. So they sometimes waste money. If they have a part-time job, they can know it is hard to earn money by working. If they know this, they decrease the frequency of wasting money and they can know the troubles of their parents on working. They respect their parents. I agree with this statement according to that two reason.",A2
"I think that college students need to have part time jobs, because I believe that they should earn theirs living money. Why should college student have part time job? Certainly, first of all that college student must do at is studying hard to graduate from a university as soon as possibly, but they by don't pay theirs tuition fees by themselves. Tuition fees are paid by their parents. Furthermore, some college student rent one-room apartment, some of them don't pay fees that they rent apartment. Those fees also are paid by their parents. Then, what should college student do? What can do to help their parents? That is earning their living money by themselves. We, college student, should consider that our parents don't force us to go college, but allow us to go it. In other words, we, college student, should gratitude to our parents for going college. So college student should reduce load of parents that they paid for us. We must do the minimum thing that we con do by ourselves. Accordingly, I think that college students must have part time job to earn their living money for helping their parents, and study hard to graduate from a university.",B1
"I agree with the statement. There are some reasons. For the first reason, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. They want to play with friends, buy their favorite clothes, and take part in parties. Some people who live alone near the college need also a lot of money to live. To do such things, they need money. Before entering the college, most students were given money by their parents, but some day they must be independent from their parents. So, they must know the difficulty of getting money. Of course, students can't make all money for their life, but I think that they have to get at least enough money to satisfy their desire and help their parents. For the second, they can meet many people to have a part-time job and get different knowledge which they couldn't get ever. There are many kinds of part-time jobs, and there are various people at the working place. Some are from very far place, and others are very older or younger than them. As working with such people, they can learn many things. And the experience of part-time jobs may be useful for them after entering society. For these reasons, I think that college students need to have a part-time job.",B1
"Everyone knows that cigarettes are harmful to the body is true. But knowing that is the majority who do not quit smoking. In addition, there is very rapid these days, women were smokers. Streets as well as restaurants, cafes, pubs, etc. , is full of smokers. But the whole world and all people are not smokers. There are also non-smokers. So there is plenty of growing conflict between nonsmokers smokers. Emits the smell of smoke in a restaurant meal you will be very unpleasant. So now a lot of restaurants are mostly non-smoking section. I think the smell of smoke during dinner bad manners do not, but Love the shoes of cigarette smokers may be a too selfish to that. So a good compromise between the position of both measures, but not easy to find. I think that the restaurant sells alcohol and smoking also thinks its okay to acknowledge me. As he would so biheupyeonjaeman because that's also not fair. The restaurant sells wine in a little smoke-free atmosphere to credit is okay, I think. The Often we think that in addition to a restaurant and a meal without wine is to make a non-smoking section is courtesy of nonsmokers.",B1
"No smoking please! Addictive, destructive, and lethal! That's how I describe smoking. Once you are in, it's hard to get out. Smoking must be banned on public places and establishments because smoking in public places increases the risk in a person's health. Smoking bans should also be strictly implemented around the school perimeter. There are various reasons why people smoke. One of these is peer pressure that is hard to reject. The worst part is that if you enjoyed it, it will be the start of your dig to your own grave. Another reason why people smoke is depression. People who are depressed have high tendencies to smoke or drink. They engaged in smoking for they believe it's a cure for pain they feel. Some say it's their stress reliever. Through smoking, they find relief from the stress and problem they need to face. Smoking has become a societal trend. One feels he needs to smoke in order to be part of something. Others have also developed a perception that a person who smokes is cook especially when it comes to smoking men. However, others find smokers as a lower kind of person. There are a number of persons who wish to avoid smoking because it's various health effects, but they can't easily because a cigarette has a very addictive content much more addictive than heroin and cocaine. People who smoke are prone to respiratory diseases as well as the people around them. They are not only jeopardizing their health, but also the people around them. There are several diseases one can acquire through smoking but the most ultimate effect is death. All these could be avoided just by not engaging to smoke.

It has very alarming effects on health. It may lead to smoking cough and lung cancer. It should be strictly prohibited at restaurants. Because a smoker, along with himself if destroying health of all the other people there. As, the smoke is also very injurious either you smoke or not. It badly effects bronchitis and capillaries rounding lungs. This leading to Astana and breathing problems. Moreover, at restaurants people have food stuffs. When smokers smoke, they also inhale the smoke and effect themselves. Thus, in a way smoker disturbs other people. Therefore, such people should not be allowed to smoke at such deviational places. In this way they pollute the environment. Smoking has injurious effects. So, it should be banned. As, we are not able to control this at ergo scale, so at liege scale we should do effects. Like restaurants and other places like hospitals etc, at least on these places it should be banned. Because, in this way we may be able to reduce the number of smokers that is increasing rapidly.",B1
"For me Part time job is not applicable for students because students must focus themselves in studying their lessons. Some students cannot do their household chores and they will have their part time job in a company what do you think will they do there. There are a lot of disadvantages for having a part time job if you are still a student, first the balance of time in school and at your work, next the distance because sometimes the distance from school and your workplace, another is your allowance is it fit for your fare going to school and going to your work for your projects and other school fees, and of course your health do you think your body can sustain the tiredness that you feel because you will study at the same time you will work. Working and studying is very stressful. What if you have examination you cannot focus on your study habit because of you are tired. But if there are disadvantages there are also advantages part time job is a big help for those students who has financial problems and to those who are hardworking they know how to balance their time very well. If your work is not that hard well you are lucky enough rather than those who has a very difficult job and at the same time small salary. The salary that you get you can use it for your tuition fees and other important things and at the same time it teaches us how to balance our time properly and become hardworking people. In part time jobs what we can get there is the experience and we can use that in the future.",B1
"Smoking was never beneficial in ones ' health; this may lead to lung cancer to not only the users but also the people that surrounds them. The restaurant is for the public where the rich and the poor may interact. It is also the place where people can smoke freely. Morally speaking smoking in a public place is definitely shows no respect to others. Health wise smoking would greatly affect the people that surround it. For me, smoking in Public places like the restaurant must be banned for it shows no positive side in using such thing that would affect the people. The smokers who do not follow the law must pay the consequences. They must undergo seminars about how smoking can affect the life of many. They must also be fined with proper amount. Violators who didn't seem to learn and continuously do such action must be placed behind bars. The seemed law may seem to be too harsh for a minor mistake but a person would only learn if they don't learn it the hard way. They will continue smoking in public areas until someone like the authorities would confine them for their own actions. Smoking only leads people to sickness.",B1

"Of all countries to ban smoking in restaurants is the sound silly. Why this topic has been presented as a problem you cannot understand the intentions of the questionnaire. Is it possible to smoke in public places, as I'll understand? To ban smoking in public places where non-smokers in a smoker's perspective, not to think at all, are not considered. Smokers who underwent a questionnaire is very disliked the appearance. Mentally and physically harmful would smoke in the forefront of the country to choose a path that is not a specific system has a fail to exclude smokers staying at the time is wrong.

"Smoking is a bad habit in my point of view. On our society, the person who smoke is detest or there is nobody need to stay near him or her who smoke because the terrible smell and a danger from the smoke. So, in our country there are the low or the discipline that do not allow people smoke in the public place and the restaurant also in order to protect others people who do not smoke from it affects. If there are a people who break the low, they will be fined. However, I think that the sentence that they get is a light thing. Because smoke can cause many diseases such as cancer, allergy, and etc. that lead to dead. Therefore, to cope this trouble we must completely ban at all in any public place, especially restaurant in our country for the better quality in the people life and better quality of people mind and can make our society to be place that we can live safely without the health problem from the smoke affect any more. Finally, I hope that in the future Thailand will be the first country where smoking is be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, especially so for restaurants that are air-conditioned or have al fresco dining options where customers can eat in the open. I believe everyone including smokers themselves know the disadvantages of smoking. Studies have been done to analyze the awareness of smokers about the detrimental impacts that smoking has on their health, and it has been proven that they indeed know what they are doing to their body, at least have an idea so. That being said, many people are also aware of the disadvantages of second-hand smoking and thus we should prevent this from happening much as we are able to since second-hand smoking is not something that we can avoid by choice. Although smoking bans may invade on the rights of the smoking population, however I feel that we need to instill in the smokers a sense of responsibility to the public and society at large. Restaurants especially, are particular about hygiene and if there are large amounts of smokers who crowd the al fresco dining area, then restaurant owners may lose out on a lot of the non-smoking patrons and this proves detrimental to not to the restaurant but the public as well as they are not able to enjoy dining ambiences that are meant for them to enjoy.

"Having a part time job is very important to college students. A part time job is a big help to college students because it helps to prepare their selves to their career in the near future. They also teach students who doing it to know the basic techniques on the career that they will choose up to the difficulties they might engage to their future jobs someday. College students who are engage to part time job improve their selves in different skills that they may apply on their future jobs. But there are different disadvantages and advantages for those college students who use to have part time jobs. A first disadvantage is that, college student could become too busy with work and neglect other responsibilities. There are person that can't do multi-tasking. Also the student may be tired from work and may not do their best in school. And also, the student may be at work a lot and not have as much time to spend with family and friends. Aside from having those disadvantages of some college students who are in the part-time jobs, there are also advantages. First one is that the students have a freedom to make their own money which means they can choose how and when to spend it. Also, it gives the student responsibility to juggle their time and plan ahead with regards to school, work, and other things that they are engage in. 242",B1
"Many students seldom agree with each other even in such trivial issues as preference whether college students should have a part-time job. In reality, it's rather superficial to simply say that a college student should obtain a part-time job. Students can earn some money in their free time if they receive a part-time job, and at the same time gain some individual experience through the job. Perhaps most importantly, we can broaden our horizon of mind through a part-time job and make our college more meaningful. And we are also aware of the tough to earn money. However, there are also adverse effects of getting a part-time job. The main responsibility of a college student is to pursue the course of study to the best of their ability. Therefore, as a college student, we still need to focus on our study. And sometimes the jobs some students take are not related to their major. Thus, it makes no sense to obtain such jobs. From my perspective, I am not in favor of getting a part-time job, the most important thing we need to do is just study. Trying to pass the post graduate entrance examinations would offer you more job opportunities and higher salary than just taking a part-time job.",B1
"Part time job is quite being a trending topic nowadays for college students. With the promises of early wealth and bright career future, in my opinion: part time job is as is good as it looks. It gives you whole future career references and an addition for your pocket money and it opens the doors of opportunity larger after you actually graduated. I did not say that part time job is perfect â€“ it is just how the students would do it. Part time job is a clear phrase, it is part time. College students who have a part time job must remember that they are a full time student, and the part time job must not interfere with their college life. While their part time vacancy filled with those younger generations, they will have better quality to compete for those better jobs with those who recently graduated from the college without any job experiences. At the end, I would suggest every college students to take a part time job since it is beneficial, and it will brings a whole new experiences and tons of new friends, not mentioning a promise full time job in some companies for those who worked well and graduated from the college with remarkable marks.",B1
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As everyone knows, smoking is bad for people's health. A cigarette contains many chemicals, many of which are poisonous, and it can cause cancer so we don't encourage people to smoke even forbid it in some he specific place such as schools or public places. Although whether he smoke or not is his free will, we have no right to interfere his behavior; however, a person smokes, he will make external cost. No one likes secondhand smoking. It is said that both smoking and secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer, breast cancer; however secondhand smoking is more deadly so we have to say no to secondhand smoke bravely. People should respect each other so smokers should respect others who don't smoke and hate secondhand smoke. According to this reason, smokers have better to prohibit in the place where people gather, and the restaurants is the place that people eat in so if someone smoke in the restaurants, it will destroy its atmosphere. Particularly, if a person smoke in the indoor restaurant, the air in it must be extremely bad. That will affect that customers' mood. I agree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants.",B1
"Nowadays, our world is much pollution that causes people health fall off every day. Smoking is one of the reasons that causes air pollution without good effect to anything. It also makes a bad atmosphere with it smoke to everywhere it arrives. Especially, when it travels in the restaurant where many people can eat and talk to each other with joyful emotion. From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. First of all, smoking is the easiest way to destroy users and people around them. I have no ideas why smokers want to harm themselves. But I think that no one want to stand near the smokers and inhale a lot of pollution to their lung. There are many people died everyday because disease from tobacco's smoke. Another reason is that the restaurants are public places that everyone can come in. There are people who hate smoke from tobacco very much. It extremely impolite to make them irritate and destroy good atmosphere in the restaurant by your smoking. Finally, I strongly believe that no one want to see the smokers in the restaurant. Because they need to dine their meal with happiness and nobody have the right to disturb theirs enjoy.",B1
"I agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are several reasons. First, smoking is bad for health. For example, smokers will have lung cancer or high blood pressure and so on, so they can't live longer than non-smokers and they have to suffer from these diseases in the future. Second, non-smokers around smokers might be uncomfortable because almost non-smokers don't want to breathe the fog especially they are eating with children. Third, restaurants are not a place of smoking but a place of eating. Smokers should be just eating and talking with their friends, fellows or family. Actually, smokers probably want to smoke when they are eating because they are addicted. So I think that we should separate smokers from non-smokers completely. Then each kind of people can eat comfortable. And I think that we should not sell tobacco to those who have not smoked yet. This is because I think that smoking costs a lot of money and smokers will not increase and those who have the diseases that caused by smoking also will not increase. In conclusion, I think that smoking never benefits us. So I agree the statement.",B1

While most parents will still be providing an allowance, college students should take the initiative to earn money to support their own needs. This will teach them to manage their finances and not take money for granted. In addition, part-time jobs can train them to be more independent. College students will be able to experience a taste of the real world, which is useful especially for those who are accustomed to cushioned and privileged lifestyles. Having working experience also helps increase students' maturity and imparts useful life skills, such as the ability to work collaboratively. Besides, the timetables in college are relatively flexible, making it easier for students to plan their time. They will have to be more disciplined with themselves. It is important that these students can plan their time and manage this asset. Having said so, juggling a part-time job may not be feasible for college students who need more time to concentrate on their studies or are actively involved in co-curricular activities. The priority for college students remains their education and if their grades would suffer, they probably should not commit to a part-time job and should focus on their studies instead. Therefore, it is important for college students to work part time as they will learn important skills and having an income helps alleviate the financial burdens of their parents. However, the importance of having part-time jobs pales in comparison to the importance of the students' grades. ",B1
"I have two answer is agree and disagree. The first, I agree with topic because in today's tough job market, you need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to your field of study, will give you an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that you have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that you have had some real-world, adult experiences and that you can handle yourself outside of the classroom and off campus. And the second, I disagree with topic because college learning has a lot of substance that student will study and remember it so college's life just be diligent and always review the lesson. It make student hasn't time to do part-time job if do part-time maybe make learning of student is down that it effect to future's student about grade that company will consider it if it not good the company maybe not receive. So college student will do something just always manage the time to good first.",B1
"Non-smokers generally find it offensive when they enter restaurants to find that people sitting at the next table are smoking. This is because the smell of the smoke usually annoys them, and they cannot truly enjoy the food. I am also a non-smoker, and I find this situation to be very offensive, but I do not think that smoking should be banned completely at restaurants throughout Japan. Even though we non-smokers find it annoying that people like to smoke in restaurants, it is natural for smokers to smoke during meals. To smokers, the habit of smoking while eating is sort of like a lifestyle, just like it is normal for non-smokers to not smoke while eating. So, I think that it is unfair for us to enforce our way of enjoying food to those that like to smoke while they enjoy food. Instead of arguing about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants, I think that it is important that we search for ways to have both non-smokers and smokers eat in the same restaurant without any conflict. We should keep the rule of having both smoking and non-smoking tables, and try to come up with new ways on preventing the smoke from the smoking tables, from reaching the non-smokers. Smoking is permitted in many places in Japan, and many non-smokers are not happy about it. However, banning smoking everywhere will not completely solve the problem, so it is important for us to think of how to make more tolerable environments for non-smokers.",B2
"Why many college students decide to do a part-time job although they can only learning and use their free time to rest. Some student must work a part-time job because of their family credit, while others do a part-time job because they want to. Personally, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job First of all, the students that have a part-time job can get some money to share the work of their family and they can develop many important skills to become a good worker, such as responsibility, punctuality and self-command. They also learn how to work with other people and gain many experience from older workers. Most importantly, when the college students graduate and want to find a job. The students who had a part-time job in the past are more interesting than the other whom not. Especially, the students that did a lot of past-time jobs for many years, it's a proof of diligence of them. However, there are some students who do a part-time job brush away to learn in campus. They must to memorize that the reason why they are students is to learn to find a good work in the future. In my opinion, I don't think that do a part-time job while learning can make any problems if they use their time worthily. In conclusion, I think that a part-time job is the first step to the key of success.",B1
"I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. I would like to show you three reasons. The first reason is that restaurants should be places where you enjoy food, not to smoke. Restaurants serve you very nice and special food. You can enjoy beautiful food with your all senses like seeing, smelling and tasting. But smoke can harm this very happy time. You cannot enjoy look food due to smoke. You cannot feel good smell due to smoke. You might not understand the real taste due to smoke. Smoke of cigarettes prevents you from enjoying nice meal. Secondly, I want to mention that most of the people who don't smoke really hate smoke especially when they have meals. People who don't smoke are really sensitive for smoke and smell of cigarette than smokers. Restaurants are different from outside place that can push away smoke and get fresh air. People could not enjoy their dinner due to smoke. Finally, I will tell you for the third reason that your smoking can harm other people who even want to avoid bad effect on their health. People who are concerned their health cannot help breathing smoke. For these three reasons, I believe that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1
"We should banned people from smoking inside the restaurant. We should have manners and etiquettes. We should respect others who do not smoke for their healthy life. If one customer smokes inside the restaurant, others customers should suffer from the smell and ashes which are bad for the body. There are also several reasons why we should banned people from smoking. It is because that as generally known, the 2nd hand smoking is worse for the body than 1st hand smoking. For 2nd hand smoking there is no filter which blocks ashes and other bad ingredients to go inside the body. And there are what you call manners in public places which we should follow. We should not make others uncomfortable by the smell of the cigarette. We know that there are also young people who came to the restaurant to eat and enjoy with their parents or friends. They also can smoke outside the restaurant if they really want to smoke, even if it is tiresome for them to do. We should think of others before thinking of our own benefits. By helping others to keep their rights and by following the manners inside the public we can make better and happier society.",B1
"In the restaurants have many people whether children or the elderly and there are some people for smoking. If you are the one who does not smoke and you do when you see people smoking in restaurant. You should be alert to him but you wouldn't dare same me. It is very bad smell and I don't like it. In order to protect children and some people not smoking because of the smoke of cigarette can harm health of people not smoking, at the restaurants is the public place, smoke can taste changes and is a bad example for children because in restaurant have many children. Therefore the country must to set the law about banned smoking at all the restaurants or open zone for smoker at all. In order to protect the people not smoking from smoke of cigarette. And the law should be strict and should punish people that smoke in public because will have some people smoking break the law if this law not strict. But some places should except the law such as pub and bar because pub and bar of drinking and drug. But the country should set the low for protect many people not smoking.",A2
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several arguments for this ruling, however. Over the past few years in Singapore, smoking has become completely banned in indoor establishments, including dance clubs. Indeed, smoking is harmful and unfortunately affects all others in the vicinity. However, as long as cigarettes remain legal in the country, I believe smokers have the right to light up if they desire. In my opinion, completely banning smoking in every restaurant is impractical and pointless. The decision to allow smoking should instead rest on the restaurant's management. Making a blanket ruling on their behalf will be detrimental to business, as patrons would avoid such establishments if banned from unwinding with a cigarette while having a drink with friends, for example. Many eateries today have outdoor and indoor seating areas. Restaurants should have the liberty to designate smoking areas within the outdoor zones to keep their smoking customers. Banning the practice altogether may please some customers, but at high costs. Such customers can be pleased in more creative and practical ways as mentioned above. For many, cigarettes are a habit and an addiction. Refraining from smoking during mealtimes may be impossible for some. The onus is on the smokers themselves to be considerate when doing so. ",B2
"Some people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with it. There are some reasons to support my idea. In Chinese traditional custom, many people getting together are a pleasure, especially in a restaurant. However, the reality is that many people smoke in restaurants. Then people feel uncomfortable because others smoke in the restaurants. In my opinion, as a public place, restaurants are opening for every customer who wants to spend money on meal. So if one is smoking in a restaurant may annoy others, it is not a good idea for the boss to allow this action's existing. On other hand, many people who hate smoking may feel sick when they smell smoke so that they cannot enjoy their meal. For a long time, there will be no customers' presenting in the restaurant. That will be a big loss for the restaurant. If it becomes more serious, some customers may get disease even by having second-hand smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in a restaurant, as far as I am concerned, is not a polite behavior. So smoking in public should be banned and smoking in restaurants should be banned too.",B1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke must consider the bad influences on other dinners at the restaurants. Even though smokers think that it is quite refreshing if they lit up a cigarette and enjoy this kind of relaxing moment, other dinners may not think so. Other customers think that the act of smoking at the restaurant is disturbing and severely destroy the joyful atmosphere of enjoying the delicious food. The smoke to them is not only a resource of leading to a bad health but also a devastating reluctance to revisit the restaurant. It is obvious that smoke has an impact on customers' willingness to go to a restaurant. Moreover, the government should ban the act of smoking because smoking is harmful for people's health. If they just allow restaurants owners to decide, it is a kind of advocating smoking. And it will cause people to doubt. Smokers may think that they can smoke at any places and anytime as they want and thus the smokers may create bad impacts on the customers. Therefore, the government is supposed to be awarded of the backpack of the banning thing in order to prevent bad things to happen.",B1
"""Receiving a part time job is commonplace and important for university students nowadays"" This statement is especially true for those students in Hong Kong. It is a widespread knowledge that students aged between 6-18 are normally granted 12-year free education in Hong Kong. Understandably, university students are excluded from the privilege of free education and most families often find it harsh to shoulder extra financial burden after the short-lived joy of securing a place in university by the children. Even worse, the fee is not only confined to $40, 000 annual lesson fee, but also other expenses in buying astonishingly expensive books and joining numerous socializing activities in campus. Perhaps this phenomenon gives a sound reason for many undergraduates and postgraduates to find a relieve for their harsh financial situation and enrich their life experience in dealing with other people. Furthermore, free time for university students is prerequisite to find out their aim and explore their potential. A part time job would be a good agent for them to learn responsibility, time management and commitment to their own business. All in all, taking a part time job is a wise decision for a university student.",B1
"It is an interesting topic for us to discuss, and it is necessary for us to consider if we should do something in our spare time. As a university student, I think it is important to have a part-time job. I have three reasons below. First of all, from primary school to now, it is our parents who are supporting us to study. We have not spent one coin, which is earned by ourselves. We are no longer children; we are adult now. So we have the responsibility to support ourselves. To have a part-time job is a good choice. Secondly, the life at college is not so busy that we don't have any spare time. As a matter of fact, we have leisure to do many things we like. You may spend time on computer games, or doing some reading, or learning some software or something else. Certainly, you can find a part-time job to make life full. At last, a part-time job is a job, we could gain experience in the process. We can learn how to work with others, how to adjust to different environment, how to do a plan for ourselves to have a brilliant future. It must be useful in the future life. In conclusion, I think it is important and helpful to have a part-time job.",B1
There are many harm material in cigarette. In the world people smoke every day. Even we cannot find non-smokers. Almost people cannot quit the smoking because there is nicotine. It has very powerful addition. If this thing is piled in our blood way we cannot control the smoking. We need more cigarettes in a day. My family doesn't smoke but other people who I know are smoking 2 packs in a day. I think it's crazy. In addition now men smoker are recreation but women smoker increase. When I walk on the street I often see that girls smoke. They looks like not adult. How they can get a cigarette and why they smoke. I know one day they will regret their smoking or realize the smoking is very harm four their body. Actually when I was student some of my friends were smoke in the toilet or parking lot. They recommended a cigarette to try. I tired but it taste was so terrible. I asked why you guys smoke do. They said just we couldn't quit our smoking and got a stress. If in my future I get lots of tough situation I will never smoke. In conclusion there is only harm things in the cigarette also smoking don't help to get rid of our stress or bad situation.,B1
"I believe that it can be beneficial for college students to have a part-time job, but its necessity depends very much on his/her circumstances. A part time job, foremost, can provide students with a source of income. This will reduce some of the financial burden that their educational fees and other miscellaneous spending place on their families. Working for their own income (or a portion thereof) also nurtures in them a responsibility for managing their personal spending and earning patterns. It is likely that experiencing the effort required to generate income will incentivise frugality and wiser spending decisions. Furthermore, part-time jobs allow students to hone new or existing skills. A tutoring job, for example, not only allows the student to keep his/her mind active and constantly practise the subject, but also forces him/her to acquire a whole new trove of skills relating to teaching. An administrative job can prepare the student for administrative work --- which exists in most regular jobs --- required in future, as well as allow him/her to exercise organisational skills. On the other hand, a part-time job may detract a student's attention from his/her studies. A significant amount of time and effort inevitably has to be dedicated to the job, and this comes at the opportunity cost of revision and other school work. Should the student not be able to cope with both simultaneously, it would definitely be better for him/her to focus on studies and perhaps take up temporary job opportunities during the holidays instead. Therefore, I feel that a part-time job can be an important part in a college student's development, but need not necessarily be a priority. ",B2
"It is commonly said that smoking is injurious for health. But it is a bad luck of our nation that in spite of knowing the dangers of smoking they do not often care for these restrictions and healthcare warnings. We find smokers smoking the cigarettes on roads, markets, restaurants and other public places. Smoking should be banned in restaurants. Firstly, other people also feel disturbance because of smoking in restaurants. The smoke screens of cigarette are untolerateable for some people. The smoke screens are also cause of lung cancer in non-smokers because they inhale them through air. Secondly, smoking also mars the charm of environment and people avoid going in such restaurants. It pollutes the environment and makes it a source of illness. We should act quickly to check all such kinds of evils. There should be an end to this bad activity that affects the vision and peace of mind of the people. We need to understand the true dimension of pollution created by smokers in restaurants that is perhaps one of the greatest problems of our country, as much as of the old, plaguing the health and well being of the billions. Smoking needs to be banned in restaurants.",B1
"I think that a college student to have a part-time job is important. Because I can make money by myself. Besides, I can know many friends. Every holiday my friend and I can go singing at Cash-Box. After singing, we eat dinner together. Every day is a happy day. I love my friend, because people say ""True friends always help each other when they are in trouble"". A student to have a part-time job that can train his independent ability and thinking ability. There is no denying, a student to have a part-time job that is right. Now, many college students have a part-time job. They make money and work hard. Than, they fail their class. Because they work all night and tired, they sleep at their dormitory. When mid-exam is coming, they loss. This is so bad. We never give up our study.

Part-time job will sustain the skills and aptitude in solving the immediate problems.

"Part-time job Today, the college students that have a part time job are the normal thing because some students have some reason to get the money. But sometime the part-time job is not important for college students because some organ in Mae Fah Luang University have scholarship for many students that want some money to use to study in the university. Do not do the part-time job while you are college student also help you to have more time to study in class, review the lesson and learn more new things outside the class too. Someone think that part-time job is good to do on your free time and you also get the money but in the other hands getting part-time job maybe effect for your study. If you cannot plan for your time with job or study, you might be losing in two things in the same time. So I think that you should to choose to do only one thing because if you determine to do one thing in one time, the effect will be good for you. All universities want to help everyone that want to study so if you have the important season you should ask them to help you. If you brave, it is sure that you will get a good things for your future.",A2
"I agree the issue. The smoking is not politeness behavior in the restaurant. The taste can effect person enjoy the food and endanger their health. Eat food is a nice thing; it is make us relax, happy and satisfied. Sometimes, eat just for take a break to go to next works, if somebody smoking around you, and you are not a smoking, the feel is not good. The smoking is not a good hobby. Smoking is not good for health and the smoking have to deference to other people in the restaurant. Smoking person make me uncomfortable. Smoking is not good for our health; maybe it is make he feel good for minutes, but smoking to take a change for the health, and make people uncomfortable can not enjoy their food in the restaurant. The smoking can result in the lung cancer. If you smoking a lot and you obtain the lung cancer probability to be very high and not your family, friends but also people around you, either. The smoking can not enjoy the food in the restaurant. Smoking destructions sense of taste. If you smoking, people maybe don't like chat with you, because you are Smelly. In conclusion, the smoking is not politeness behavior in the restaurant. The taste can effect person enjoy the food and endanger their health. And maybe people have interpersonal relationship.",A2
"Smoking is the activity that can make some of the people feel comfort. They think that the stress will be gone by smoking. For some people, they will smoking in everywhere they can, in this case in restaurant. But for other people, it's disturbing. From this case, I will argue that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the whole country. First, it should be banned because the some that is produced from that activity is harmful. Smoke from that activity, if it is inhaled by people, it can be more harmful. The smoke can make their lungs is not healthy again because of that smoke. The smoke can make the air in the restaurant more dangerous. Next, it should be banned because it's the disturbing activity. Some people won't eat foods when they see that near them is smoking person. The smoke, again, can make them won't eat the foods. The effect of that is, for the restaurant, the profit that the restaurant earned will be down. It's because the people don't want to eat in the restaurant that has not healthy air. From that reasons, the smoke is harmful and it's a disturbing activity, I say that the smoking activity should be banned in all restaurants in the whole country. If necessary, they can take some money from the smoking people. For all the smokers, stop smoking from now, because it's not healthy for your lungs and your body.",B1
"It is not important for college student to have a part-time job as it may not offer what is required for the students. Whether a not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and also their priorities. College life may have long breaks in between the semesters which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job which can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship in a company or to prepare for the upcoming modules they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a mean to fill their excess time and it also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during semester period as there will be lesser time spare for the student to do their academic work. However, having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can better enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that the importance of having a part-time job for students in college is not necessary unless by circumstances or by the needs that the students have to satisfy. ",B2
"Cigarettes have substance that stimulate nerve it called ""Nicotine"" that is narcotic drug, appetite suppressant and poison. Cigarettes bring about effects to smokers and people around smokers. Effects from smoke of cigarettes is an important principal that harm people's health around the world, it cause smokers risk danger from diseases such as cancer, heart disease, congestive heart failure and emphysema. If a smoker is a woman, cause have more opportunity to risk for miscarry and baby who is born may have weight lower than usual, it cause smokers may look older than usual because smoke should increase wrinkles on your face. Smoking cause metabolism raise than usual, so it cause smokers lose their weight. Smoking cause smokers extravagant money to buy cigarette to smoke and treat sickness. Smoking is illegitimate if you smoke cigarettes at restaurants that have air-conditioned, smokers and owner place must punish by fine at least 2, 000 bath. But at restaurants that not have air-conditioned, restaurant must have suitable zone for smoking it called ""Smoking zone"". I think smoking should be ban in all restaurants in the country because cigarette have more effects about everybody health even though people who don't smoking and children. If you want to smoking, I think you should smoke at personal place such as your home or an office. It can decrease pestilential disease for people at public place.

"I disagree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I'll show a reason which supports my opinion. First of all, the most important thing for college students is studying. If we have a part-time job, we will learn a lot from the experience, too. However, I think we must spend most time on studying. If we study earnestly, we hardly have spare time to work part-time. Most college students who have a part-time job work in order not to gain experience by practice for their future plans or to earn fees of school but to earn money for their interest such as drinking, buying clothes, play, and so on. I think that there is something lazy about them. They probably think that they will be able to graduate from college as long as they study averagely. They enjoy their life style now, however, once they go to a graduate school or start to work after graduation they realize they should have spent their energy on studying more and spent more meaningful time in college. College students should make a great effort at studying for own future. This is why I disagree with this statement.",B1
"I'd like to see that happen. I mean I do agree with the ban, we have had similar bans in the UK for sometime now. What I am thinking is that Japan has one of the largest populations of smokers in the world. Would the Japanese government consider alienating all those potential voters to introduce a smoking ban in restaurants? If they do, more power to them I say. My understanding is that Japan already has some smoking bans in some areas of Tokyo and other cities so I see that they are taking some steps. A restaurant ban is a huge leap though with so many restaurants strung out across Japan so I wonder how they would be able to monitor the ban. Are they going to train a special restaurant smoking squad to travel throughout Japan and keep an eye on the restaurants? It would need to be a large squad to cover that much land mass. Don't get me wrong, anything is possible so I will adopt a wait and see attitude and hope that it does come about. If it does, then full kudos to the Japanese government and all of those who pushed for this to finally take effect.",C2
"For me, It's upon a situation for a college student. If the student is well enough and if family can support for the study, therefore it is not important to have a part time job because the part time job or a working student cannot budget their time fully, reasons of overtime, tiredness, mentally absent and etc. For example, for a student like us we have eight hours of studying and we allotted time for making the assignment, project and etc. We take the two â€“ four (2-4hrs. ) in our twenty four hours in daily lives and we still have to work to earn money, let say for five-six hours(5-6hrs. ) then we are tired to that and probably there's a chance of failing grades. If we are born lucky enough or that the money is well enough in our lives, therefore it is very important to have it to finish the study and to find a better job or the best job because better is not enough for me. Students that a have part time job is a well independent because it is not for themselves to continue study, their goals is to help their family. It is very important for them or for us the money and the time to finish study. For those students who take a part time job for their luxury needs, it is also a good and bad. The good is there are not depend to their parents to bought what they want because they have a money to buy and they earn money, and they know how to budget it. For the bad side the they work for their selves and have a bad habits like drinking liquor, addicted in computer games and many more.",B1
"I think that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because tobacco give very injurious to people. In the restaurants, people eat food so many people do not like smoking. Moreover, cleanliness of food is very important to people. In addition, passive smoking's give damage to others people. I want say three reasons that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, when eat food, people do not like smoking in the restaurants. Because foods eat taste and smell. In addition, smell of cigarette is disturbed to others people. Next cleanliness of food is very important. Food should always be clean and fresh. Therefore, taste of food is delicious. However, if the side table smoking, we think that is annoying and go out in the restaurants. Last passive smoking's give damage to others people. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Passive smoking give very injurious to people. Also, passive smokers more injurious than smokers. In addition, Restaurants have a very narrow because there are people receive all the damage. Eventually, the damage caused by smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also we must try to do not smoke in restaurant and should try to be considerate of others.",A2
"Undoubtedly, to the benefits of the smokers, the banning of smoking in restaurants would serve as a warning of care from the government and the public. To the non-smokers, the law means the protection of their rights from breathing second-hand smoke. In making our decision, we should take account of weights of both sides to voice our support to ban smoking in restaurants. The fact â€“ smoking can cause cancer â€“ is well documented and well-known for years in our society; the sad fact â€“ no one seems to care â€“ is so common in Hong Kong. The owners of the restaurants give one reason: the ban scares off their customers (smokers). Therefore, their other customers (non-smokers) have to accept breathing smoke passively. In the meantime, the vicious circle goes on. A chronic smoker might go into coughing and spitting. Some might up in hospital. Some might pass away with cancer. The non-smokers might for the medical bill to treat for their allergies due to inhalation of foul air. However, the smokers might believe smoking as their right of enjoying their time â€“ even having dinner in the restaurant. On the other hand, the owners of the restaurants might believe their rights to run their business. Who has the authority to mend the wrong? It seems there is no answer. Our outcry for the protection of the restaurants from smoking is ignored by our leader â€“ the government and its official members. In fact, it does not even protect our health and the public benefits. In all, no matter what, I would say: Ban smoking in the restaurants!",B1
"First, before I start the essay, I need to define what smoking means. Smoking in this context apparently refers to the act of putting a cigarette to one's mouth, lighting it, and puffing on it vigourously such that smoke from the cigarette enters your lungs. Generally, the effect of this would be to give that person a slight high due to the effect of nicotine on the mind. There are other definitions of smoking, such as the Singaporean definition, which is to pull wool over another's eyes. Now that I have defined smoking, I need to define restaurants. Restaurants can be defined as a place where people, generally humans of the species Homo sapiens sapiens, as opposed to Homo erectus, ingest sustenance. This sustenance is generally believed to taste good due to the fact that it was ingested in a restaurant. Since the purpose of the restaurant is to provide a place with ambience so that the food ingested is perceived to taste better, smoking detracts from this experience as smoking is generally disliked by the people around the smoker. As such, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country as it detracts from the very purpose of a restaurant, which is to provide a location for people to enjoy good food.

"I do not think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. We are very young, and we have a lot to worry about, so we don't need to waste any time on things that we don't absolutely have to do. For example, when major is engineering, and every week I have hours and hours of classes and homework and lab assignments. Even if I wanted to work, I would be hard pressed to find the time, and I also think that I would be very stressed out by adding anything more to my already busy schedule. I know a lot of people would disagree with me on this, but I kind of think it is parent's responsibility to provide for their children at least through college. Certainly, after they graduate student should get a fulltime job in begin their careers in earnest, but for the time being I think we should enjoy the little time we have before we're forced to become real adults and spend all our time being serious. In addition, I don't understand why everyone expects us to be so responsible even though we're just kids, so I think it is not really necessary for college students to be working.",C2
"My opinion the part time job has advantage and disadvantage. Because the part time job makes students have a short time to prepare education or reading books for exam. The part time job makes students have low or drop grade because they use almost time to their part time job. That is disadvantage about part time job in my opinion but the most important thing is allocate time of mine. But part time job makes student have more money and then they can use it to buy stationary or buy everything that they want. When they get money by part time job they should use it for family. Those are all advantage and disadvantage about part time job in my opinion. Having considered in detail, I still hold on my position that teenagers essentially need to work at least one job when they are student in schools to receive several benefit from it. So, I predict that schools and parents will support our young person to work a part time job. We have to ask ourselves, who can deny the importance of working of teenagers or we can ask ourselves should we do our best in our study? All people got their own reasons and they choose their own paths for going.",B1
"Part time job is a job which an individual performs at any organization for brief time for the sake of earning money. This could of the type that you have to spend a few hours at a job daily or you have to spend 2-3 complete days in a week for a job. There are many reason for which we have to adopt this course of action for earning money. The main reason is the bad financial conditions. Today there is economic recession in the whole world. And the poverty is increasing day by day. The people don't have much of the money to pursue their dreams of higher studies. So unwillingly they have to follow this course. In the day times they study at their schools and the evening they work at the hotels, libraries etc to manage their expenses. Some times along with their own expenses, they also have to earn something for their families as well. So it is a big social dilemma. Not only the student adopt the part time job but also the professional go for part time jobs to earn more money. for example doctors work in hospital for the whole day and in the evening times they run their own clinics. The reason once again is the lack of money. In doing all these thing we have to sacrifice one thing, that is, our social life. We are unable to give time to our family in a struggle to earn happiness for them. And in an unfelt manner they go very far from us. But the reason is once again the same, Poverty.",B1
"I agree that it is necessary for students to have a part time job. Based on what I have observed nowadays here in our country students are the most common to search a part time jobs especially when summer vacation comes. Instead of staying at home many students decides to have it to help their parents in gaining money for the purpose of their tuitions. Having a part time job is a big help to an ordinary student especially to those who are unfortunate but still doing and finding a way to finish their degrees or ambitions in life, students can pay for their education and thus will value their education even more. There are many benefits also that a student could earn having a part time job because it can foster a sense of competition, which is important for students in the future. It enhances a young person's social development. Part-time jobs can help students apply their knowledge in practice and, in return, their experience will make them know better what they have learned in classes and books. A job can help students better develop their identities, obtain increased autonomy, achieve new accomplishments, develop work experience, and become more independent from their parents. Aside from that with the money earned, students can buy many books they like, they can even buy clothes or other material needs without bothering a help with their parents and in that way it is lessens for the expenses of the family. For college students having a part time job provides students work experience and it can help to look good their resumes. Having a job while studying is great, aside from you are earning you are capable of gaining some benefits from it that could be very useful when you finish your pursued degrees.",B1
"Many people believe that both having a meal and cigarette is the way of social life and doing business. However, while it is well known that smoking is bad for human's health, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, under the second-hand smoke environment is worse than smoking by them. Restaurant is a place for family, any kind of people even kids and pregnant women to have a nice meal. If you allow people smoke during the meal, it's not only very rude to other guest having meal with you but also hurtful to other customers sitting in the same restaurant. Second, all those customers who don't smoke might stop coming to the restaurants which reduce the income of the restaurants and make them shot down easier. The taste of food would be destroyed by having smoke at the same moment as well. It is not a really proper way for enjoying a nice lunch/ dinner. Last but not least, smoking is not a requirement during the meal. Normally people want to smoke after the meal instead of during the eating process. If people want to have a more relaxing conversation by having a cigarette, they can also go outside or some other places such as lounge bar. Smoking in a restaurant is not only an impolite behavior but also cause other customer's bad influence on their health. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2

The students will get income to pay their living cost from salary of their job. They will not bother their parents and spend their parents' money so much. Moreover, the students will be discipline because they can manage the time well, they know the time when they have to study and when they have to work. In the part time job, the workers may not be late to come to their job. So, it forces the students as the workers to be on time in their job. Not only that, it also can develope the student's knowlegde skill. The students can develope their knowlegde when they are having a part time job. So, after getting lesson from the college, the students directly can apply it in their job. Furthermore, the studebts can use their time well, they can avoid from wasting the time, such as playing, shopping, and many others. And their time just for useful activity. So, having a part time job for the college students is very useful and important. And all the students in the college should provide their time for having a part time job.",B1
"In my opinion being a smokers harms our body, and absolutely I hate smokers around me. Despite my father is a smokers and I really stay away from him when he was smoke. I'm pretty confuse by the people smoke around the places like terminal, mall, bus etc. In my mind, I always think about them, did they realize people among them? Definitely they never think about that and they don't have any respect for this.. I have a lot reason why we should not smoke. First, smoking just affect our health and we must spend a lot of money to buy some cigarette, and definitely we know being a smokers damage our lungs. And you can get some disease like cancer and reduces the length and quality of your life. And the others reason is you are out of respect for the people around you, and that is pretty disturbing. When you smoke, you not only harm yourself but you also harm all the people around you. So you must be selfish. If you love yourself especially for man, please stop smoking!! Think about the people around you, who love you, likes your friends and your family. I'm sure they won't to see you suffering or sick because of that thing. You just spending your life, your money, and the important thing is you will spend much money for medicine if it going worse. So you should think twice for decide to stop smoking. Because we had dreams for our life.. And from my article, I am really disagree about being a smokers and for some people didn't have any respect for their self and others people.",B1
" As is known to all, part time jobs never fail to appeal college students. A part time job can always teach something that you can not learn in class apart from giving you money. Time and intelligence can be fully used, ability and courage can be practiced, and you are bound to be fully rewarded. So as far as I'm concerned, it's important for us college students to have a part time job. For one thing, part time job offers you a golden opportunity to intercourse with a lot of people who you seldom have access to make friends with and who you can surely learn much from. This is very important for us, since we're highly likely to be locked in the ivory tower. It is often the case that we bury ourselves in books and tests and even isolate from the society. In addition, doing part time jobs, to some degree, makes students aware of something like duty and thrifty. I used to spend lavishly. But since I have done some part time job, I fully recognized that earning money is truly not an easy thing. Besides, students can gain a sense of achievement by earning money themselves which does good to their mental health. Last but not least, students can really learn a lot of skills and get self-improvements. To sum up, the advantages of doing part time jobs far overweigh the disadvantages. With a little bit of caution, you can acquire money, friendship, practice and fun in the same time. So why not?",B1
"Many people say that college is a small society. College life is not only full of studying. Learning knowledge about major and improving our ability of communicating with others both are very important! In order to adapt ourselves to the fast changes of society and make our experiences more colorful, taking a part-time job in our leisure time is a good choice. It's possible for us to have a part-time job. In college, we have more freedom. Our leisure time is enough. And there are many jobs provided for you. You can make your own plan and work hard for the jobs you want to do. There is no doubt that you will benefit from the experience. Firstly, you can get direct wages. It does not only can reduce the heavy burdens of our parents, but also can taste the happiness on the moment of getting the money which is made by us. The second point, which I think is more important, is a good way to create new experiences. So we will be well prepared for our future life after we graduate from university. In conclusion, for college students taking part-time jobs is practical and important. Just try and be brave to see how far you can go.",B1
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have had a part-time job ever since I was in high school, and this has made me a much more mature and contributing member of society that some of my friends. In the modern world, it is very hard to grow up and there are no real marks of whether or not you are a full adult, but having a part-time job in college is one of the ways which you can demonstrate your responsibility and also make some cash which you can use as you want. For myself and many other girls, we like to shop a lot, and so it is good to have a continuous flow of income so that we're not cutting into our savings or we want to go have a little shopping spree with the girlfriends. This is not to say that boys do not do the same thing, but they might be a little bit better at controlling their bank accounts and so they do not have to worry about it as much. Also, we have to buy a lot of makeup and other things too maintain our appearances, and a lot of this stuff is not cheap. Many people might think these are some stupid reasons to have a part-time job, but to me they're perfectly good, and so I will use them to state unequivocally that most college students can have a part-time job.",C2
"I think part time job is not important for college student. Because they can study only while they are student, so they should spent their time for their study. When they are student, they feel lecture is boring and not interesting. But they understand they waste their precious time after they graduate college and have to take a job. My parents often say that you have to study hard while you can study. And they say we don't save their money for your study, so you don't have to do part time job. I can't still understand importance of lecture. In the future lecture may help me. When I was little, I take many lessons. Piano, basketball, swimming, writing, English and so on. I don't like those at that time. But now I think they are useful. For example, thanks to basketball and swimming, I can get strength. Thanks to piano, I can read music. As long as those, lecture may help me in future. They do part time job for many reasons. Some of them have to part time job for their life. I am happy because I don't have to do part time job for my life. So I can't say college student should not do part time job. But college student should keep their mind that they spent their precious time on part time job.",B1
