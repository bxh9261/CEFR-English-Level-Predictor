I believe it is not crucial for college students to obtain a part-time job. Personally, I believe it is the responsibility of the school and government to provide the student with adequate funding for their room and board, so that the student can focus on their primary job: their studies. Unfortunately, in North America, those who are underprivileged are unable to study without getting a part-time job, and thus are at an arduous disadvantage as compared to their classmates. In a perfect world, no student would need a part-time job in order to supplement their studies, and they would be able put their full attention to their studies. I do understand the blatant and necessary purpose of cooperative education and internships which allow a student to supplement thir learning with real-world experience, however many of the part-time jobs students, especially international students, recieve is on-campus manual labour, mainly in food service. I do believe these jobs provide very little value beyond very basic skills which can already be achieved in a learning environment, so the point is moot.
