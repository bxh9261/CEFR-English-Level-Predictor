I believe in the reprehensible damaging effects of smoking, and all of the negative health effects that come with it. I don't believe banning smoking in restaurants merits being called discrimination to the smokers, and if smokers can not control themselves in a restaurant, they should re-evaluate their addiction. There is nothing more terrible than making an appearance at a fine eating establishment only to be assaulted by a despicable onslaught of smoke, and many people agree with this. Many people would say that the government should not intervene with a restaurant's private business, so long as they are not breaking the law, which I agree with, but that's not a relevant argument for the question, since I believe banning smoking SHOULD be a law, thus the government has the right to interfere, and the military should get involved if necessary. Okay, so that last part was a joke, but at this point I'm just adding words to the dataset.
