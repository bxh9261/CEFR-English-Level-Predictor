"I agree that it is important for college students to have apart-time job. Nowadays, a large number of college students are having a part-time job. Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine for example, when Lily was a college student, she went to supermarket as a promoter or went to be a family teacher every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly got a good job after graduating from university. in the other students' opinions, they think that they can buy goods they want their parents cannot afford. I know a student that he goes to a restaurant as a waiter at his part-time to earn enough money what a computer needs. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents always don't agree us to get part-time jobs. They are afraid that our study and safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is good for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to get knowledge from the part-time jobs and make them a helpful tool for our development.",A2
"n the last years, college students taking a part-time job become very popular in the big city. Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But I disagree with it. I have some reason to support my idea. Firstly, I hold that everyone should have the most important thing to be done in the different period. To be a student, study is the key word for us. If you cannot study well, you waste your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden through taking a part-time job. But it has a bad effect on their study. They do not know the most important thing their parents respect is that they can learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention on your study now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, learn professional skills and practice yourself is the most serious thing in the university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. So don't be influenced by others and try to keep on learning knowledge and you will succeed in the future.",B1.1
"Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions about this question. Some people think it is good to have part-time job. But some other people don't think it is good to do it. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons. Some people are agree with this sentence. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' burden. Besides, it also can increase their chances to practice in society. However, some people object this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste student's time and affect their studying. Therefore, they just need to work hard. As far as I am concerned that students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, without selection, some working that everyone can do will waste our times. And we will learn less. Also it will make working ineffective because of we don't do the job which we should do. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and have some selection.",B1.2
"I agree the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons to explain my idea. College students need not only to learn knowledge of books, but also to practice in universities. College students have a part-time job, which are interests. College students can make their knowledge learning from books practiced by home teaching, and they can get the living experience through a part-time job. They can find out their shortcoming and advantages. A part-time job is good for college students' growth. For example, these people's achievements that also experienced the living of a university prove that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college age, they go through the living of a part-time job, and all respects of their abilities are raised. They become more confident of themselves and they have great powers to work. So the reasons above show explain my thought. I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. That is good for the developing of college students. So if you have a chance to have a part-time job, try to get it and work hard. You will get the advantages.",B2
"I believe it is not crucial for college students to obtain a part-time job. Personally, I believe it is the responsibility of the school and government to provide the student with adequate funding for their room and board, so that the student can focus on their primary job: their studies. Unfortunately, in North America, those who are underprivileged are unable to study without getting a part-time job, and thus are at an arduous disadvantage as compared to their classmates.",C2
