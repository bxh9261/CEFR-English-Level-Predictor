"Some of the richest people in Indonesia come from cigarettes factories. That's not the one. But the most income for Indonesia also comes from cigarettes factories' tax. But, is smoking is important for Indonesia? Actually no, especially smoking in the public place can be considered as a murdering. There is a lot of disease which can be caused by smoking. Neither smoking directly nor indirectly is not good for healthy. One of the public places which must be smoking banned is restaurant. As we know, restaurant is a place where we eat some food and smoking is not healthy. Usually, cigarettes' smokes enter human body from its respiration organ. But when we are eating there is a chance cigarettes' smokes enter our body from our mouth which will continue to our digestive system. It will be more dangerous. Because the smoke enter our body from two way, nose and mouth. And we also know that smoke can make cancer. It means we can have lungs cancer and digestive system cancer in the same times if there is a smoker in the restaurant. According to those facts, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in Indonesia. It is the most income for Indonesia but it also brings a lot of disadvantage such as disease. Not only for the restaurant, but also in the other public places must ban smoking.",B1.2
"If smoking can be allowed in the restaurants, I will point out some disadvantages for banning it. For example, when talking about smoking, we can imagine about the pictures in hospital that showing about people who died by lung cancer. The main factor is from smoking and they are very suffered. Smoking kills many people in each year and it seems that the number of people is increasing year by year. Even the government is trying to promote the policy to reduce smokers in the country but it seems that the policy isn't really successful. Not only smokers will get hurt from smoking but many people who smell the smoke also got effect. The results in many studies shows that the people who smell the smoke from cigarettes is taking risk rather than the smokers. They can easily die rather than the person who smoke. It is very interesting that the smokers can live longer than the person who got only smell. So, if it is possible, the smoking could be controlled in an appropriate places. All people should help the government to make this happen in order to save the world and people lives. One possible resolution is having a sign on the restaurants to tell all kind of customer that this place is not allowed to smoke, so customers can see and ready to act.",B1.1
"I don't agree because I think that this is more to do with being a private, informal arrangement between restaurant owners and people who patronise their restaurants. The owners either allow smoking on the premises or they do not. If patrons find a smoking restaurant offensive then it is a simple decision not to go to smoking restaurants. I am not sure if the Japanese Government has a say in this side of things under Japanese law and I am not a lawyer. Like most governments though, I suppose that they could either re-write or override and laws really since they are the government. I don't smoke but I have friends that do and they are usually quite considerate about where they blow their smoke. Not that I am making excuses and I neither condemn them or condone their smoking because it is their lives after all and provided they do not infringe on mine or anyone else's health than I guess that they are free to do as they like. So long as they are obeying the local laws of the land wherever they may happen to reside than I think that it is a case of live and let live.",C2
"I think when you are college students, You should concentrate for study. If you have a part-time job while you study, you do it not extremely. You shouldn't do two things in the same time. If you have part-time job, you could have enough time for reading or free time for relaxation. Although you have much money but you haven't life while study. You could have not time for your friend and family. You won't do something, you want to do. You could try for studying and part-time job. Do you think ? if you have much money but you don't have friend. Are you happy? But if you think more. When you have part-time job, you have experience more many people. There are advantages and disadvantages, we should be very selective and careful to choose. Part time give you experience and money but you may lose friends in the university and you may fail the study because you don't have time to revise the book and do the homework. Studying only, you may study very well, concentrate to the study, classroom. You have interactions with your teachers and your friends in the university, you may have good friends, close friends but you don't have experience for working. But for me, studying only is better in this time.",A2
"In today's world, it has been debated whether Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants or not. Some restaurants regulate smoking for many reasons. Other restaurants just separate smoking zone from non-smoking zone. I disagree smoking should be banned at all the restaurants for 2 reasons. One of my reasons is that people have to have freedom. And it depends on country as to what they violate. People over 19 can buy cigaretts anywhere, so they have right to smoke anywhere. Of cousrse, I am non-smoker. However, my father who somke cigaretts often told me that cigaretts helped him lower his stress level. Likewise, some of them feel relax when they smoke. So we don't have any right for them not to smoke. So it should be legal to smoke anywhere, of course, under the restriction that you have to be over 19. Second, there is a best way not to infringe the rights of each other. The way is that restaurants separate smoking zone from non-smoking zone and give right to do something. I think it is generally agreed that an individual's rights extend so far as they do not infringe the rights of another. To summarize, smoking at restaurants should be legal to reserve right to do and people should have the right to smoke.",B2
"I believe in the importance of college students having a part-time job, because it will enrich their lives in more ways than one. Firstly, a part-time job will help to cultivate financial independence. This is especially important as college is the preliminary stage before one embarks on his or her set career path. With a part-time job, college students do not have to rely on their parents to provide allowance for them, and they will effectively learn how to manage their finances well; thereby preparing them for the future. Furthermore, a part-time job during college time will also reflect well on students' portfolios. Essentially, college serves to prepare students for their future careers. In college, the exposure that students get to working life is minimal. Rather than merely undergoing internships during the holidays, students can actually make use of part-time jobs to gain the sufficient exposure they need to equip them with relevant important skills for working full-time in future. Such experiences will help them to gain better interpersonal skills, learn to submit to higher authority, etc. Another notable point is that a part-time job will add diversity and color to a college student's life. It can be admitted that the workload of a college student is rather heavy, and much time has to be devoted to studying so that students can adequately understand and apply concepts learnt. Hence, many actually find themselves spending the bulk of their time studying and not participating in other activities. This could then adversely impact their social lives, among other things. A part-time job will ensure that there is a balance in students' lives such that they do not'burn out' from excessive studying. Of course, they must also know how to efficiently allocate their time such that working will negatively impact their studies. ",B1.2
Part time job is very common in daily listening. due to increasing economic pressure the income of a single middle class person can not fulfill the needs. the part time job is a job that is to be done by a middle class person to fulfill the needs of his or her family. there are many reasons for part time job we are living in such a society where is a lot of expenses. Sometime the income single job could not meet the expenses of only food home and cloth. In our society there are a number of families where there is only a single person that has to bear the expenses of whole family. There are a large number of family members. So one has to do part time job. Our increasing expenses due to following the fashion able society also cause to do part time job. The part time job is not very easy to do. One has to do extra work that is very difficult. One often tiered one cannot give time to his personals. Mostly there are part time jobs at night. These jobs disturb the sleep and cause philological problem. Part time job during studies is very common to day due to lack of pocket money for students. It is very difficult students cannot give proper time to their studies. in this way the brilliant students also cannot study with efficiency. This is the major problem that intends to do part time job. We should have to take the steps against such unimportant expenses it reduce the economic burden. Part time job is also not such a bad thing. Some time it is very important if we cannot fulfill our needs any way. Some needs are very important for living. In this way part time job is very necessary.,B1.1
"My part-time jobs have been very unique and different from the norm. I do not go to companies to work as a admin stuff during my weekend, but instead I have been working as a tuition teacher, and a kinder gymnastics trainer. I enjoy both of my jobs very much as not only does it pay well; it also is really fun and interesting to interact with the children. Their ages for the kinder gymnastic classes ranges from pre-nursery to k2s. the kids are extremely cute when they recognizes you and try to be close to you. The small talks with them have also been very interesting. They are simply hilarious. The tuition children that I teach ranges from primary five to primary six. I would find this job more tiring but nevertheless, they are still interesting people. I remember feeling extremely lazy to go and teach tuition after a long day in school. However, I still had to be responsible enough to go. Also, many a times I wanted to skip tuition as I had a test/exam the following day; however, it seems as if their exams were more important than mine. In the end, I still had to go and teach them. However, it was satisfying when you see improvements in their grades. ",B1.2
"I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is because I know that those who like smoking feel stress if they are told not to smoking, and to smoke after dinner seems to make them happy and calm very much. I think that both smokers and nonsmokers should enjoy dinner. I hate smoke of tobacco. When I go to a restaurant with my friends, we usually choose nonsmoking seats. If I smell of tobacco, I lose the want of eating a little. Therefore, I wish all the restaurants completely separate smoking seats from nonsmoking seats, and prevent smoke of tobacco from leaking out of smoking seats. By it, everyone can use restaurants comfortably. However, I have a problem when I go to a restaurant that allows every seat smoking with my friends who like smoking. When I enter it, I manage to stand the smell. I can afford to chat with them. However, as they start to smoke in front of me, I hardly stand it. It is too unpleasant for me to eat, but I sometimes can't ask them to stop it. Therefore, honestly, I wish all the restaurants to ban it.",B1.1
"I think, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, I hate cigarette smoke, it makes dirty others, it is disgusting, cigarette smoke not only, injure of who smoke cigarettes by oneself but it still injure the innocent who them no gets into with these thing. ""you think, it is fair already!, with who don't smoke but they must participate to are responsible in the behavior of who smokers. "" People die of terrible diseases from breathing other people's smoke, and it is bad for health of who smokers, smoking cigarettes causes the disease various kinds, which, make the body is born the going back looks shabby, such as, the disease footpath system breathe, the cancer the lungs. Another reason, I hate at my clothes has the smell of cigarette smoke because it makes me feels to are not cheerful, and feel dirty, the reason that smoking cigarettes should prohibited in the restaurants, in important all place or even in the public place because of the battle stirs others which other person will may don't like stinking smell of cigarette smoke, make the annoyance other people, may have the revelation prohibits to have smoking cigarettes in the public place, and the place have a lot of people. Finally, The cigarettes is habit - forming drug and it is illegal in some places. I believe it will help to make smokers quit smoking. If, they persistently, the government should have the penalty provisions of a laws completely for who disobey, maybe the health warnings or maybe these new laws will help them stops.",B1.2

"Have you ever done a part-time job? What do you think about it? Of cause when you are in college you thinking about having more money to buy what you like. If you have a lot of free time and you don't know what to do. I should say that why not you try part-time job. Part-time job can give you many profits. The most important is the part-time job can give you money and help your family save money. If you can find money by yourself you don't need to tell your family to give you money that is the way how your family can save money. You should do part-time job if you have free time. It is better than you just sit still at home and didn't do anything. Past-time job can give you a lot of experiences that you can use after you graduated and working. For example, if you doing a part-time job in supermarket you will know how to selling a thing and you will know a lot about marketing. Now a day, In Europe America Japan, most of teenagers do part-time job because they want to get money and experience. Are you the one who let your free time past and gone or you are the one who use it benefitly?",A2
"College students should have a part time job. It is good for his future because someday they must search some job for them and their family. And searching job is not a easy things. Some people can't get a job because they do not have a lot of experience. Some person may things that people who have a lot of experience means that he is a professional, especially for young people. Have a part time job is easier than get a real job. But you can't just have a part time job until the rest of your life. Because it is not has a good fee. It is not enough for your life. Part time job is not a heavy job. Example is be an event organizer, MC, or private teacher. Usually the favorite job for college students is private teacher for senior high school student. Because they still remember some lesson. Having a lot of experience is very good, it can make them easier to searching job in the future. So it is very important for college students to have a part time job. Even some student can pay their college and help their family. So, get more a part time is great but, don't make your grade worse.",B1.1
"I agree with smoking should not allow in restaurant. Smoking destroy smoker and people everyone around. If someone smoke, the health will have many bad sides such as a disease, cancer in lungs and still destroy person health who live in same location. I see many people around smoke in public area and in restaurant. They smoke in university too. It no good to smoke. If punishment for smokers, it is good. Smoking still consume expenses unreasonably to make people easy to die. They have a little time to stay. A person who smoke cigarettes is not good personality in other eyes, a person around stare at and think they are not good. They are not good to follow. But many kid like to follow them because kid think it is cool but it is bad idea. So who to smoke cigarettes then should quit to smoke. It is the good idea for them and for person around them. I agree smoking should not allow in everywhere. It is bad smell and no benefit to smoke. But if the restaurant want people to smoke, the restaurant must make a corner for smoker. Tell them to smoke in the corner and away from, anyone don't smoke. It is okay to do.",A2
"In the daily life, we have many activities to do in the free time. Someone play sports, play music or something which they like, while many people have a part time job. Most of them are the high school students and the college students who want to earn by themselves after their classes. The part time job is a choice for many people and the students who want to make money on the free time. There are many reasons that people want to do a part time job. Someone wants to find the experience but someone wants to earn money by themselves. Obviously, there are many college students who work a part time job because they have many expenses in their educational. The part time job can help them earn money for their educational and also provide them with some benefit on job. It isn't easy to work while studying because the students need to balance the work, home and their educational. Each country has a law about job for students or teen, they set how many hours a student below 18 can work, parents permission requirement, etc. There are many kinds of part time job which popular such as cashier, waiter in the restaurant, food service, tourist, etc. It is the other choice which you can choose. This way is popular for the people who want to spend the free time to make money. The part time job give many things to the worker more than we think, not only make money, but we can find the good experience from its. Moreover, as a student they will proud that they can earn money by themselves. It is the good way to create students to be a good worker in the future.",B1.1
"A successful university student should have achieved the following targets : going out with somebody, studying, having a part-time job, living in dormitory and being a member of any school society. This is what I heard before going into university. It cannot be denied university students have to allocate their time suitably and hence enriching the three- or four-year campus life. Moreover, most university students are already adults, they need to gain some working experiences to, in addition to making money, prepare for their future. Therefore, it is admitted that having a part-time job is important for a university student, which agrees with what the must-do list suggests. My first supporting point concerns about whether university students can properly use their spare time and hence maximize the gains in different facets. Having a part-time job would undoubtedly takes up some time from the students, but this gives them opportunities to learn more about time management. The second reason regards the hyhh experience : acquiring working experience is vital to university students because it offers them chances to practice what they have learnt in school and learn something beyond books. The last reason is attributed to the most realistic stuffâ€”money. University students can no longer be the plants in a greenhouse. Instead, they should make use of their ability to earn for themselves, but should not keep relying on their parents solely. This can also let them experience the hardship of earning. In short, having a part-time job is not merely for money, but it is also good for the growth of a university student. The manifold advantages brought up previously should be strong enough to support the fact that having a part-time job is a must for a university student.",B1.2
"I agree the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Certainly, some people disagree this idea and think college students should spend the time instead the time of a part-time job. But, I have three reasons of agreement. First, I think a part-time job makes my independence. I notice the independence of money by earning by myself. So I thank my parents since I started a part-time job. Second, I made friends for a part-time job. There are fifteen college students and four students of all students are students of *** University. All people get along with well. My teacher said me, Why don't you do a part-time job of teaching? Teaching is high salary. Indeed, my salary of part-time job is 900 yen an hour. But I'm satisfied with my salary because I can make friends of various university. Finally, I noticed the real independence of word 'Arigatou!!'. My part-time job is waiting on customers. Before I started my part-time-job, I thought I can't speak my customers well. But I could speak my customers now. And I could notice the independence of 'Arigatou!!'. If my customers don't say anything when I bring dishes to my customers, I feel dislike and uneasiness. If they say me 'Arigatou!!', I'm very very happy!! So I want to service the customer well more and more!! This experience makes me say 'Arigatougozaimasu!' in other stores. Therefore I agree this idea very much!",A2
"There are several way to destroy your health. People always do it even if they know how bad it is. For example drinking alcohol eating disorder going bed late and last but not least smoking. In Thailand, we can see people smoke in public place like on the bus, in the park, or even restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant is not allowed in some restaurant. In some restaurant, they have the forbid tag of smoking on the door. Everyone know well about smelling the smoke. It is not destroy smoker but it also destroy the people who is sitting nearby. In Thailand, we should ban the people who smoke in public place by go way from them and leave them alone. This way will make them have no friend. The important problem of smoking in public place is smoking in the restaurant. In spite of having forbid tag in front of the restaurant they still do it. The restaurant owner should fine them or maybe the owner should charge two time of the price of food that they have ordered or service them unpressured. This is also the government responsibility too. They should have a very high measure to fine them or them manage with the people who do not know the social manner.",B1.2
"I disagree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Today many people feel stressed. They have to work from early in the morning to late at night and they have little time to feel relaxed. Some of them may worry about human relations. Smoking in their break time or after work is necessary for them to work vigorously. Let me show you an example. I work at an Italian restaurant. In the evening about 40 percent of customers want to have smoking seats and they smoke while eating pastas. As seeing them, I realize that nothing can make them happier than smoking after work. And people who have non-smoking seats don't seem to mind cigarette smoke. You may say that exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke could cause serious health problems, especially lung cancer. In fact, there is a close connection between lung cancer and smoking. So smoking seats must be separated from non-smoking seats in the restaurants. And smoking people should keep in mind that people who do not smoke hate to be exposed to cigarette smoke. But as long as they follow the rule, we don't have right to deprive them of their pastime. So I am against a complete ban on smoking at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.1
"I do not think negatively about smoking. Modern people are getting a lot of stress lately. Prohibited from smoking tons of people are allowed to reduce stress. However, in public places where children such as restaurants and hope not to smoke. Cigarette smoking alone is fine, but other people adversely affected by unwanted tobacco smoke should not think. I'm human and do not smoke cigarettes do not think I was wrong. But these days the trend is increasing, many women are smokers. These days, when you get down the street smoking a lot of women can be seen. Just like old times to smoke in secret, but nowadays women are not ashamed. Such features may even surprise you sometimes. I see a woman smoking is still an unfamiliar sight. Smoking is bad for women are affecting the baby. Most of the problems caused by this smoking are health. Many people would have some health problems for staying long in the public areas. Many people would fee unpleasant and don't want to come back to public areas. The public areas are for all people, not only for smokers. By prohibiting smoking in public areas, we can have lots of bents. Therefore, it is likely to create the correct smoking culture.",B1.1
"The governments all around the world are imposing regulations to discourage people from smoking. Especially, there is one regulation which is controversial between smokers and nonsmokers. One of the regulations which are debatable is that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons supporting the regulation. First, restaurant is a place where people come to have a meal not smoke. Not only smokers but also nonsmokers, especially babies and children visit the restaurant. It is really bad for their health when people smoke. Second, smoking should be banned in the restaurants for its clean environment. When people smoke, the cigarette smoke pollutes the air inside and makes the restaurant murky. Customers will be reluctant to come in to the murky restaurants and want to have a delicious meal in pleasant restaurants. Last, the regulation brings a great benefit to the restaurant owners. They can save replacement costs by not replacing curtain, wallpaper, carpeted floor and furniture often. Also as the fire hazard reduces, the fire hazard insurance premium burden will be greatly reduced for restaurant owners. For these supporting reasons, the regulation should be applied to all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"It is an interesting topic for us to discuss, and it is necessary for us to consider if we should do something in our spare time. As a university student, I think it is important to have a part-time job. I have three reasons below. First of all, from primary school to now, it is our parents who are supporting us to study. We have not spent one coin, which is earned by ourselves. We are no longer children; we are adult now. So we have the responsibility to support ourselves. To have a part-time job is a good choice. Secondly, the life at college is not so busy that we don't have any spare time. As a matter of fact, we have leisure to do many things we like. You may spend time on computer games, or doing some reading, or learning some software or something else. Certainly, you can find a part-time job to make life full. At last, a part-time job is a job, we could gain experience in the process. We can learn how to work with others, how to adjust to different environment, how to do a plan for ourselves to have a brilliant future. It must be useful in the future life. In conclusion, I think it is important and helpful to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"A part time job for college students is something that I think they have to experience. It is because having a part time job can make students to be more independent, teach them to manage time better, and also prepare them to enter work field. The first reason why I agree to it is because part time job can make students become more independent. They can learn to do things by themselves because in their job, they also have to do things that are being asked to them. They don't only depend on people to get what they want. Secondly, part time job can also teach students to manage their time. It is because when students have a part time job, they have to divide the time for working and studying carefully. They have to use their time effectively, so that they can work and also get good scores in their study. The last reason why I agree to the students to have part time job is because by working part time, students can be prepared to enter work field. Although students only work part time, they still experience the real work setting. They know what to do in the real work situation, to perform well, and to be responsible for the things that are being trusted to them. Thus, based on the reason above, I strongly agree that students, especially college students should have part time job, because it can make them more independent, teach students to manage their time better, and also prepare them to enter work field.",B1.2
"I think that it is a shame that so many people feel they have the right to impose their opinions on others. The more rules we have placed on our behavior the less free we are, and I think it is common knowledge that both the United States and Japan are free countries. Citizens should be able to do as they please as long as this does not interfere with others. This situation is very similar to the people trying to ban guns. Most owners and users of guns are very responsible people who are properly trained in the use of guns, but there are a few bad people who are ruining it for us all. It seems that there are some very inconsiderate smokers out there who aren't doing much to help nonsmokers be accepting of their habit and may be doing so by smoking in restaurants and other public places. If smoking was banned in restaurants and restaurants in Japan I don't think it would be a huge deal because they can always still smoke outside. The thing that worries me is that the next step will be to ban smoking outside as well and this would truly be a breach of civic freedom.",C2
"Nowadays, more and more countries pass laws to ban people smoking in public areas. For example, France has forbidden people smoking in cafÃ© a few years ago. The citizens who defy it will be punished and feed for a lot. This law received warm welcome by most French people. After that, some other countries followed this deed and passed some familiar laws to ban smoking. In my opinion, ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country is very necessary. Firstly, as everyone knows, smoking is bad for people's health. Smoke can do great harm to people's lungs and breath organs, and what's more, it can raise the rate of getting lung cancer. The smoker also does harm to his or her family members while smoking. So it's wise for people to abstain smoking in order to protect their health. Secondly, when people smoke in public areas, all people around him or her have to breathe the second-hand smoke, which is more harmful to their health than to the smoker himself by research. It's also very unrespectable to other people in public areas, especially in a restaurant where all people have meal. Imagine the situation that you have to smell the choke gas while eating, it's really disgusting, and you may feel that you are offended. So I think it's meaningful and necessary to make laws to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. This can not only produce harmony surroundings in restaurants but also protect people's health from being damaged.",B1.2
"Nowadays, every restaurant has smoking seats and nonsmoking seats in Japan. However, even when we sit on a nonsmoking seat, there is often the smell of tobacco from smoking seats. The smell makes people who dislike tobacco feel bad and they lost appetites. It seems that the freedom of smoking of a smoker should be accepted to some extent. However, restaurants are not where people enjoy smoking, but where people enjoy eating delicious dishes. Restaurants should be kept as the place where all people can enjoy dishes. Therefore smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Smoking doesn't only make people feel bad with its smell, but also has a bad influence on others' health. They say that the smoke that a nonsmoker near a smoker absorbs has more harmful substances than that the smoker absorbs. Passive smoking is very bad for our body. Therefore, when you think about smoking, you will notice that where smoking is banned is increasing in Japan. For instance, we cannot smoke in trains, movie theaters or class rooms in the university. Therefore it is natural that smoking is banned at restaurants. Smoking is worse than useless. In Japan, these days, it is also difficult to buy tobacco because the price is becoming higher and higher, and the system of Taspo has been enforced. I hope that the number of smokers decrease with such reasons. When restaurants become the place where smoking is banned, it will help decreasing the number further more.",A2
"I agree this statement. Someone may say Doing a part-time job is worthless. Even if you do it, you can get only money. You should use your time for study or hobby. But, I think we, university students, should have experiences about working. Certainly, studying and doing hobbies are worthy. However, working is more meaningful, I think. While you work, you will make a lot of mistake. You will be scolded by your superior. You will try hard to understand how teach for this boy, how cook this meal, and to recover your superior's trust. If you only study, you can't have these various experiences. That is very pity. These experiences exist only in business life. In universities, you pass your student life, take a class, write a report and play tennis with your circle mates. I think there is big difference between business life and student life. In business life, money is very important. People in business always worry about how escape losing money or how get money effectively. There is a kind of interest relationship. But, in student life, you are almost freedom. There is no difficult relationship. Of course you can choose student life ways, and ignore business life. But, after graduating your university, you must live a business life. So, you should experience business life's rules beforehand. These are reasons why I insist that university students should have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First of all, smoking is very harmful. It harms not only people who are smoking but also people who are near smokers. Its smoke smells bad and most non-smokers, including me, do not like the smell of smoke. When they are eating at restaurants, I think that the smell will prevent them from enjoying eating lunch or dinner. So I disagree with smoking at restaurants. Second, I feel that the habit of smoking should be stopped. Smokers pay a lot of money to buy cigarettes and make their health so bad. They may get cancer or other health problems if they continue to smoke. It is a very strange habit and I cannot understand it. Banning smoking at restaurants may help to quit smoking. This is the second reason. It is true that there are still many smokers in Japan. However, in order to have a nice time for all people at restaurants, smoking there should be completely banned. I hope that some day smoking will be banned at all shops or public spaces and the habit of smoking will disappear from Japan.",B1.1
"Part time jobs for college students are a great idea and can really help them earn some money for; educational fees, daily living expenses and also give them some very useful on the job training experience. Some of the easier jobs for inexperienced students to land include, dish washing, waiting on tables, car wash, packing store shelves as a night clerk or if they are really lucky, working in the same industry or profession that they are going to work in when they graduate. I admit, some of the other jobs may have less appeal, but if students try to keep the big picture in mind and think outside the box, even the less than appealing jobs are great opportunities to start with. Realistically, any job experience looks better on a resume than nothing and it shows that the student was industrious, not afraid to work and was playing an active role in being financial responsible. Finally, even if the job is less than perfect, the student is still able to use this as a stepping stone toward bigger, better and maybe more lucrative opportunities. The reason is simple and I do not have all of the answers as to why, but the fact remains that it is easier to land a new job when you already have a job than it is to get a new job when you don't have a job. Statistics support this so, go figure?",C2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Learning cannot be only at school, students nowadays need more experience in society. Part-time job is a good way for students to absorb the experience. It provides them the knowledge that cannot learn from textbook and some money that they can make their ends meet. Part-time provide a method that students can be productive and know how society works. And it is a way for students to use their free time, get away from the Internet, pub or doing nothing at home. But there is an important point to know: part-time job will never be more important than school. It is the only rule that I think every student who has part-time job should keep it in mind. The very work students should do is studying hard, absorb the knowledge from books and make it useful. College is the last level that you can learn things without pressure, you should cherish. If you think that working can learn more than school, why do you still at school? Why don't you leave school and get a normal job? Studying at school and learning from working are both important. Maybe school cannot teach you how to work better but it can teach you how to be a person. That is the main reason you stay at school.",B1.1
" Part time job is becoming more and more popular. Many college students take part time jobs to get money to pay for the university or get some work experience. I think, part job is necessary for university students. First, part time job, in my opinion, is not just a way for money, it is a way to get work experience and learn about the society. Today, employees want not just your high grades, but also your work experience. Suppose that there are two persons wanting a job, one has a two-year part time job experience and the other has never worked for others before, the employee is sure to hire the former. So, part time job will help you find a better full time job. Second, part time job is also a way to get money. In the past, it is our parents who pay for us, but now we have grown up. It is responsible for us to make money ourselves to help our parents. I think parents will be happy to see that we can make a live by ourselves. Third, taking a part time job can help us make some friends of all kinds. Today, friends can help you a lot. They can give you good advice or they can help you when you get trouble. Part time job will let you know a lot of workmates, and they maybe your friends. From all above, we can see that a part time job is really necessary for college students. Some of my classmates have already taken part time jobs. So, find a part time job for yourself, it will help you a lot!",A2
"Some people may think that university students should focus on studying; they have needed not to work yet. However, I think having a part-time job is one part in university life. There are my points of view. First, having part-time job can gain working experience. As everyone saw the news that a Chinese University master cannot get a job, we should need to build up our resume in order to show our quality to persuade employer to hire. We must accommodate to be a worker so we need to have a part-time job first. Everything needs buffer, we may face difficulty if we suddenly change own life style. As a result, we need to work partly, and then we can work successfully. Besides, students can earn some money for daily life. All of us know that the tuition fee costs $40, 000 a year, and travelling fee is not cheap too. It may be a burden for the family. Thus, having a part-time job is a very good way to reduce the stress caused by the extra expense. University students are mature people, so we have responsibility to control our personal finance, try to decrease the expense which is less than income. Thus, we can be a successful people in the future, avoid facing financial problem. In conclusion, having a part-time job is important and will not waste some much time. Students must balance their time and spare some time for working.",B1.2
"Recently, number of university students are having part-time job during their study and their main reasons for having part-time job is to earn money and to obtain working experience. Therefore, someone claim that it is important for university students to have part-time job. I deeply disagree with this statement and detail two reasons to oppose this statement. First and foremost, university students need to attend so many courses every day. If they spent some time to do part-time job, how much time did they have to rest, revision or exercise? And do they still have health life style anymore? The answer is almost not. Some may argue that university students can obtain experience from doing part-time job but that is not so important for students' future because the owner will not consider part-time job working experience. Second, to earn money is not so important to students because government have well system to solve students' financial problem such as grant loan to provide money to pay for tuition fee and cost of living. There is unnecessary to doing part-time job to earn that so small amount of money. To conclude, having part-time job doesn't give too much thing to students and that will cause too much pressure to students. Therefore, l does oppose university students to have part-time job.",B1.2
"Is it important for college students to have a part time job? Well, I think it is depends on each personal or student whether they want to get a part time job or not! With also consider situation of that person or student, look at his or her family economic situation. If the economic situation of that person or student not very good I think it is better if that person or student try to get some part time job that can help themselves to make some money that can help their parents to pay some credits of their education. To get a part time job also not easy I think, look at the situation of economic right now. All of big and small company looking for employee that had an experience in every single kind of job that they apply for. They must have patient in their effort when they try to look a part time job to help them make some money for their education, also to give them some important experience. About their salary it won't be as big as graduation employee, because they do not have some important experience in every single kind of job that they apply for.",B1.2
"I think we should ban in public places completely. Because cigarette is harmful to the body. The reason is that the diseases related to the smoking can be prevented and fire hazards can be reduced. Above all, making a rule that restricts smoking in a public area plays an important role in preventing smoking-related diseases. This is because there are enormous kinds of carcinogens in the smoke of the cigarettes. The smokes full of harmful components that can cause a cancer, asthma, or other fatal diseases can affect not only the smokers themselves but also non-smokers around them. Thus by banning smoking in public places can reduce those risk of getting smoke-related diseases. Moreover, preventing smoking in public areas can contribute to decreasing dangers of the fire. The cigarette butts that are thrown away without being fully extinguished can cause irreversible disaster like the mountain fire. Lf you don't smoke, many helpful points. If people are smoking in designated a non-smoking area to try and get a little smoke damage will be reduced by the recipient. I have to everyone in the world for their families for health for all people is; I hope it does not hurt. Also lawyer should get a strong law for non-smoking.",B1.1
"Yes, I agree with topic. Because smoking is negatively impact the health of the people who are close. And people get from cigarette smoke is unsafe. You can get sick easily because body don't have immune system. Especially at the restaurant. This place is many people. That should not be smoking. Because it is a public place. This is undesirable for others people. It makes the social loss and was an unsightly. Smoking is the cost entirely. We can take money from cigarette smoking is to do something important and necessary else. We should quit smoking because I think it does not matter. At the restaurant has so many people but we know that them was not sick, that smoking can harm the people living them. So smoking should not smoke in restaurants. People are strong and safe from smoke. If we can stop smoking, it will allow the nation to live and physical impact of smoking. Therefore, smoking at restaurants that do not smoke. Or if you want to smoke should be in place should smoke and not affect other people. The stop smoking in restaurants that The beneficial good weather. The restaurants would be to eat and people to eat it with pleasure.",B1.2
"Smoking is unhealthy activity which has bad effect to the person who smoke ( active smoker ) and the person who does not smoke but breath the smoke of smoking person ( passive smoker ). The bad effects of smoking to passive smoker are more dangerous than to the active smoker. Because statement is scientifically proven. Moreover smoking in the restaurant is not suitable with the place it self. Restaurant is the place for the people who buy and eat food. So if there is smoking person while we are eating automatically the smoke will disturb us. The smoke also pollutes the environment. In biology we know that the smoke that goes out of the smoker's mouth and so if passive smoker will get the more dangerous effect because the active smoker just breath and few of the smoke. So smoking is dangerous for the smokers and other people in the restaurant who do not smoke. Not only that, although there is smoking room in the restaurant and hopefully all customers who are smokers will smoke in that room. But in reality smoking room is useless because the smokers who want to buy food in the restaurant, they not obey to the rule with smoking inside of restaurant.",A2
"I can't agree to the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Whether it is reasonable to smoke in the restaurants depends on the real case though smoking is proved to be bad for people's health. And in most of cases smoking in the restaurants is not reasonable. For example, if smoke in elegance restaurants, it may influence people nearby taste their food and harm both sides' health. And it also may leave a bad impression to others and make others angry with you, which may lead a conflict. Smoking in public restaurants is bad for people's health so it should be signed that ""Please stop smoking for you and others"" in the wall of the restaurants. But in some cases if smoking is banned, the restaurants will not be able to operate well. For example, if the customers book a personal room to have a dinner, their behaviors of smoking will not affect others. Though it is bad for their health, it is their choices and they smoke for more enjoyment. The customers will be angry and get away and won't come any more if the restaurant manage doesn't allow them to smoke, which will drop the restaurant's business trades. And in the small restaurant in the countryside, smoking may be not easy to banned because the customer are almost farmers, which don't care much enough the rules. So let them go will make the restaurants operate along. So completely stop people from smoking in all the restaurants in the country is so absolute that it is impossible to reach.",A2
" The facts about smoking are out there, public knowledge, clear for all to see. Smoking causes lung cancer, destroys the health of new-borns (when the pregnant mother smokes), reduces stamina, stains teeth, and the list goes on. It's not just the smokers who suffer these ill effects; anyone who is subjected to the inhalation of the smoke also has the potential to suffer these same effects in a similar capacity. The problem with smoking is that it cannot be effective contained within any particular area. The smoke flows like the wind; it is not sucked away by fume hoods over stoves. Why do governments persist with allowing smoking in the first place given that there are no health benefits? Is the money brought in by the tobacco companies worth more than the health of its citizens? That is looking more the case with every smoking related death. All restaurants should ban smoking within their premises. In a world that is trying to push for healthy living from eating right, then perhaps the next logical step is to promote healthy breathing too. The absence of smokers in these eating places will bring economic benefits as well. Many non-smokers and those who cannot stand the fumes from smokers will then be able to enjoy the food offered at these restaurants. If a restaurant wants to allow smoking in its premises, then it should be a smokers-only venue. This economically unviable option would cause all businesses to follow suit and ban smoking indefinitely. Just like no one should be subjected to unwilling sexual assault, no one should be subjected to unwilling lung assault by these toxic fumes too. ",B2
"It is important for college students to have a part time job. -It is important for college students to have a part time job so they can help their parents. It is also important for the students to have a part time job so they will have experience in working, and on how to be a good employee. If a college student has a part time job he or she can buy things that he or she might want without getting the money from his or her parents.

It can also help lessen the expenses of the student like for example buying of books, food, clothes and etc. For college students, having a part time job can help increase our economy. Having a part time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. It will also build your character because you will be obligated to go to your job because if you don't go to your job you will not earn money. For college students like me, having a part time job will make my-self more employable, I will learn some personal and financial responsibility and I will experience life outside the school.",B1.2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons for I think so. One reason is to make money. First, the purpose of having part-time job is to make money. Why college students have part-time job? The reason is something like this. Many college students leave their home town and live alone near the college. It takes too much money for their students. For example, the house rent, the cost of living and so on. Some their parents pay the house rent and sent some money to their child, but it is not enough for the students. So many college students must have part-time job, and make money for them. The other reason is more important. It is to have social experience. Many college students, after graduating from their college, find employment and work at the company. Before working at the company, to have part-time job during college students. In fact, I have part-time job now. The income is very important and necessary for me. And I could know how important the money is and, how much I have relied on my parents. The experience was very important for me. From such thing I think it is important for college students to have part-time job.",B1.1
"It is said that tobacco is a poison, harmful for our healthy, and it is caused of cancer and other severe disease. Many people die from smoking around the world each year. And recently, it is often said that secondhand smoke is more dangerous, especially for children. In the small room like restaurant, there is a lot of danger of secondhand smoke. Some restaurants in Japan, there are divided two types of seats, smoking seat and no smoking seat. But sometimes the two seats are closed. So if someone smokes in the restaurant, there is also a danger of secondhand smoke even if we seat no smoking seat. Therefore, to remove the danger of it, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And it may enable to decreases the number of smoker. Many countries, especially America and Europe, make many laws and regulations to restrain from smoking. And there are often banned from smoking at all the restaurants. But some Japanese people don't consider the danger seriously. They think that smoking is not so harmful for us. For that reason, Japanese laws and regulations about smoking are less and easier than that of other developed countries. But it should be more strictly in Japan. Smoking is harmful, not any good.",A2

Children and teen age are very big. They pushed in this habit by the bad company and bad people. Some people used just for fun. But many of them used for the relaxation of mind. Smoking is very bad habit among people. And this left very bad impact on life of people. This may causes the many incureable disease like mouth cancer, stomach diseases, T.

"I can't agree. I think smoking should be absolutely prohibited in the restaurants because it will affect the health of the non-smokers there. This is an unfair event. Although smoking is not an illegal behavior, it is really a bad deed to force others to breathe in second-hand smoke. Therefore, I think smoking in the restaurants should surely be banned. Moreover, the number of customers will decrease because some people are afraid of second-hand smoke in the restaurants and avoid going there. This makes the restaurants suffer from financial loss. Three years ago, I had my dinner in a restaurant. While I was eating, I smelt a kind of disgusting odor. At that moment I discovered someone smoking. So, I forwarded my complaint to the staff of the restaurant. But, the staff said that the smokers had the rights of smoking there since there had not been any law to restrain them. I was extremely angry then. Luckily there have been laws to restrain the smokers nowadays. This is good news for the non-smokers. It allows Taiwan to have fresh air that will no longer polluted by smokers. Smoking is actually so annoying that the laws against it should be set up even earlier.",A2
"I think that college students should have a part-time job once. We are going to have a good experience for their future by having a part-time job.

These experience is good effects our future. And, because school days, we can have a many experience. If there are interesting, we should do it. Even if there are not interesting, we should have a part-time job to find sense. But, we become students to study. We should study. If we take all the time in school days to part-time job, we could not study enough and it is bad effects for our future. It is wrong that you have a part-time job without study and only study without have enough experience. We should have a part-time job and we also should study. So we should use time efficiently to study and have a good experience. Using time efficiently is also necessary to become a member of society. So I think that college students should have a part-time job.",A2

Because of without smoking, they (smoker) will feel unhappy. I do not know why they feel like that. You know that I am not a smoker so I cannot explain why they feel like that.

"Restaurants are public places and pollution free. atmosphere within the restaurant will need to be eaten fresh. In each meal, food is useful to the human body.

When smokers go very will accumulate toxins in the body and will harm the body as a substance causing lung cancer and other intestinal finally died in the end.

"There is a common consensus that smoking is bad for health as it leads to many diseases such as lung or throat cancer. In addition, smoking also leads to second-hand smoke that affects non-smokers as well in the form of passive smoking which lead to similar health problems. As such, it may be understandable to ban smoking in all restaurants. However, this might cause a drop in customers for the restaurants as they might choose alternatives like hawker centres or taking out and eating in a place where they are allowed to smoke. Also, smoking is a lifestyle choice and people should be given the option to smoke or not, without so many legal restrictions. In my opinion, smoking should definitely be banned within the indoor seating of the restaurant as it causes the second-hand smoke to diffuse and remain within the air circulation. As such, if the restaurant is able to maintain an outdoor smoking seating area, which is isolated in a manner that little or no second-hand smoke can reach the indoor or outdoor non-smoking areas, smoking need not be completely banned from all restaurants. This will give flexibility to customers who may be heavy or social smokers. ",B1.2
"It is said that smoking is harmful. On the other hand, there is an opinion that smoking is harmless, too. I cannot judge whether smoking is harmful. However, I want to assume that smoking is harmful and to express my opinion. I think that smoking should not completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because the no smoking seat and the smoking seat have already been divided, I think that it need not limit more than now. There may be a person who regards passive smoking as a problem, too, but I think it won't be a problem at all if a designer cares about to air conditioning. I think that the modern society becomes strict with a smoker. I think that the reason is that feelings that the Japanese wants to belong to the majority are strong. I think that they want to think that does a good action by blaming the minority. I do not trust mass communication and the government, and I think that it is necessary for people to think whether all matters are always true. The sale of the cigarette should be prohibited if smoking should be really prohibited. However, the reality is not so. A tax enters by a smoker. Therefore I think that the government does not prohibit a cigarette. I think that it is important to watch from various angles. Therefore I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan in view of economical aspect and psychological aspect.",A2
"Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country so that it will lessen the place that the people will smoke in. because smoking is a bad habit widespread among teenagers. It contains dangerous items which destroy the human brain and lungs. It causes different diseases such as cancer in different areas in the human body. Base on what I heard before the reason of the teenagers ' why they are smoking is through smoking they think they show people that they are adult and can do whatever they want. Smoking is very bad to your health. And it causes so much pollution in our environment. Even if you're not smoking, you can also get the diseases that the smokers will get by simply smelling the smoke that the cigarettes have. There are a lot of disadvantages when you're smoking first it wasted your money. And it causes a lot of disease like lung cancer and other health problems. And of course if you're smoking it will lead to addiction. Smoking is very bad that it will lead death if you will not stop.

"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking attacks not only firsthand smokers but also secondhand smokers so at public places like restaurants smokers should avoid smoke. Penalty by government is the most efficient way to have smokers keep social rule. Here are some reasons for this opinion. First, smoking brings bad influence to people even though they are in the same place with firsthand smoker. Restaurants are not a personal place but a public area so many people from young baby to seniors are using. In this place, we should think of other people's health. Second, as we all know the fact that smoking has a lot of bad aspects but, it is very difficult to quit smoke by oneself. I think the public ban is the most efficient way to help them be more careful. I am not saying that all smokers must give up smoking but they should avoid public place, and putting penalty will helpful. For those reasons I strongly say that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, in the public place, smokers have duty not to influence them badly. Second, putting economic penalty is the best way to help them regard the proper place to smoke.",B2
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant ? For this title. I don't need to think a lot to share my opinion, I absolutely without any doubt agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant. Smoking as we know is very dangerous activity that will affect in long period time. The cigarette producers also put the bad benefits that is contained in cigarette. From that we know that smoking is a dangerous activity. Now I'll talk about smoking in the restaurant. First, not all the restaurants visitors are smokers. In the restaurant there are so many people from many ages. From adult to old age peoples. So, I think that smoking should be banned. Because the smoke from cigarettes will produces bad side effects from people that don't smoke, so they can be the victim of smoking. They can cough, hard to breath, etc. The air condition will be not fresh again and it'll disturb the air flow in the room. With all the uncomfortable things than can caused by smoking, banned smoking will be the very best way. But if it's not possible than the restaurant must create a smoking area for the smokers visitor, so they'll not disturb people who don't smoke",B1.2

The smoke is also harmful for the asthemic patients. Hence, the parents and elders should be aware of the hobbies of their youth.

"Recently, our teacher have given us a topic about weather people can smoke at a public place. In my opinion, the answer is certain no. The reasons are as follows. Firstly. Smoking at a public place will make the environment of the public place become dirty, What' more, the cigarette ash have much hazardous substance which will pollute the environment. So, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers. Secondly, at a public place, there are many people who do not smoke. so, if someone smoke at a public place, it will hurt other peoples' body. meanwhile, the strong-smelling of the cigarette is quite terrible to many other people who do not smoke. As we all know, cigarette have a lot of carcinogenic things. Therefore, that the government ban smoking at all public places is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. Some smokers often say that it takes away some of their freedom. But I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. All in all, people should not smoke at public place, which is no denying.",A2

The year we will be looking to tighten the only way is to waste time, wasted body and must have inspired much patience. I think working Part time as leisure time is very useful. Both as a waiter.

You cannot image how terrible it is for a college student to have a part-time job, people who object to the opinion emphasize this. From the point of their view, it is the course-studying that we college students should concentrate on and doing a part-time job wastes plenty of our time, what is worse, what it brings us in wealthy is far less than what it takes us in time and knowledge. They also assume that we will earn more in future in return once we contribute all of our time to studying during college, it's a further investment. While, when it comes to the topic, the others put the great agreement on college students to have a part-time job. They stress that no matter how rich or poor we are, we should go for a job in college, and it's not a matter of earning money, but an opportunity to close to society. What's more, it's not merely for us students to accumulate the experience, but a chance to apply what we learn in class to the reality. Taking part-time jobs will obviously do much good to student; it's not a waste of time, not to speak to the short-sighted. What is known to used all is that every coin has two sides, but as to have a part-time job, I think, we students benefit from it more than what we lose from it, and what the society really needs isã€€typed talent, but not the ones who can recite a great many articles, who can tell a quantity of theories, or who can just write a pile of useless papers.",B1.1
"These days, many restaurants in Japan divide the seats into two type seats, smoking seats and non-smoking seats. As you understand by this fact, most of non-smoking people hate that others smoke by their seats while eating. To enjoy eating and taste of meals completely requires your mouth, nose and eye. However, people cannot feel that the smell of their foods is good if there are smoking people in nearby their seats because the smell of cigarette smoke defeats that of dishes. In addition to, the smoke makes a lot of things dirty, such as clothes of people and tables or walls of restaurant, and the smell of tobaccos is left in the restaurants by people smoking a bunch of time. So, smoking affects not only people present there but also restaurants themselves customers who will visit the restaurant after a person smoked. Besides, smoking does harm to your health whether you smoke or a person around you do. That is why any people should refrains smoking at restaurants. Sitting on a non-smoking seat nearby a smoking seat is no different from sitting on a smoking seat. So, the beat solution is to prohibit smoking at any restaurants in Japan.",B1.1
"Smoking is not good. Cigarettes are a drug. Cigarettes are bad for our body. But we still smoke cigarettes because Cigarettes are addictive. My father smoke. Heavily and I hate my father smoke heavily. My friends smoke, too. I wish they don't take a cigarette. Cigarette is known is not good in the world. People know Cigarettes is not good. But people cannot seem to quit. The Smoker is addictive. Lots of people are getting cancer cause of it. We must warn everyone how serious smoking is and we must help them stop. It's been years since I heard that the government has raised the price of cigarettes. But they didn't raise it to make people stop. They did it to earn more profits. I mean why did they only raise 500won if they intended to make people stop smoking? They should have risen more and more. But there's one problem. If this policy really works, and no one buys a cigarette, Korea will get a big damage. Almost more than 5 percent of budget is earned by cigarettes. But if this stops, all of us could get in trouble. So it will be impossible to make them stop selling cigarettes.",B1.2
"In my opinion, all restaurants in China should not completely ban smoking. Instead, it is necessary for most restaurants to set a smoking area to serve smokers and other restaurants to completely ban smoking. Although the majority of people support the assertion that smoking is harmful to smokers and people near them, in reality, there are still great amount of people in China who are smokers. Once all restaurants begin to ban smoking, smokers cannot stand the period in restaurants without any cigarettes. As a result, it is possible that large groups of heavy smokers give up to eat in restaurants and instead begin to eat at home or buy fast food, which will course great reduction of restaurants' profits. Thus to look round the corner, it is reasonable for restaurants to divide themselves into smoking area and non-smoking area, then smokers could enjoy their cigarettes after finishing their delicious dinner without complaint from non-smokers while non-smokers could appreciate their dinner without smoky air. As I know, the Show Coffee is among those restaurants which first begin to set smoking area and non-smoking area in China, which is largely welcomed by its customers. In addition, there are special restaurants with limited room for the division of different areas. Under this situation, all the customers' health is much more important that the smokers' addiction, so runners of those restaurants should completely ban smoking without any hesitation.",A2
"Part time job is an activity that we can do while we are having a free time. Many university students and students do part time job. Everyone has different perception about part time job. But, there is one main reason why people like to have part time job, that's for getting salary, experiences, and actualize ourself. In my opinion, part time job for university students is not too bad. In this case, they should get experiences before working when they graduate then. As we know that experience is the most precious thing in our whole life. Every university students have to think how they can apply their knowledges from college in working world then. They must think about their visions too. Because of that, I think part time job is a good way for students who want to get many experiences in working. They can fill in their free time with part time job, rather than do negative things that can ruin their studies in school or university. Beside those, they can get money by themselves. They can use that money for paying college duties. In the other hand, they can be more appreciate money. Because many university students can feel how difficult for people to get money. So, I really agree with part time job for students or university students, also they have to maintain and keep their studies well.",B1.2
"I believe that smokers should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers have the right to smoke when and where they want. However the right should be limited in the range of not harming other people. Every human beings have rights to do what they want to do. However, if they all insist just their rights, there will be a lot of conflicts because some rights may be harmful to some groups of people. So the criterion for regulating the rights should be in the range of not annoying other people. For example, there are some places such as coffee shops or internet cafÃ© that offer separate room for non-smokers or smokers only. This policy can guarantee all people's right to smoke and right no to smell smoke. Only in this case, smokers should be able to smoke in restaurants. Smoking is not only annoying non-smokers by its smell, but also it is very bad for our health. It is also proven that there is more harmful effect for people who breathe in the smoke than people who actually smoke. So smokers are kind of killing people by giving off the smoke. In conclusion, I strongly believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants for bad smell and harmful effects to our health.",B2
"Part-time can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes only a few courses, rather than a full load of course work each semester. Workers are considered to be part-time if they commonly work fewer than 30 or 35 hours per week. Many reason people want to take part time job, because they want to get additional income. Usually before get full time job, people take part time job. Another reason to take part time job is to get income when they are very busy. online survey is the easiest way to make money. There are many sites online that are free to join and gives you an easy way to make money. During the life of your campus should have a part time job that has no effect on your education. With a job online, you can work whenever you want and you can rest whenever you want. There are many part-time jobs for students that offers revenue opportunities for them. Getting listed in the survey paid as part-time jobs for students is not a tedious task. if you like nightlife you can work at the club. They are always hiring new people. Another fun job is to teach young children. Teaching children to add big money into the pockets of individuals.",B1.1
"I don't agree that smoking should be completely banned all the restaurants in the country because it is not fair for the people who are smoking. People who like smoking go to the restaurants but are banned to smoking. How they felt? Where they can go having a good meal? Another reason that I don't agree is the government doesn't bane people smoking. Because of that why can we completely banned smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The government allows that people keep smoking but want they don't smoke in the public. I don't think it's logic. It is just really unfair for me when thinking about people want smoking anywhere. Although smoking is really bad for people, you don't bane it completely; you can't bane people smoke in where they want. If you allow them to smoke, you have let them smoke everywhere. You make them don't smoke in the restaurants, and it is against the law of personal right. So I don't agree that be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I agree that should be completely banned smoking in the country. If every people don't smoke, the earth and people in the earth may become healthier. Our life may become clearer; it's not only in the restaurants.",B1.1
" Since the mankind has come into existence ALLAH provided everything but when the humans didn't obeyed ALLAH orders, they payed for their deeds. So from that day every human worked In different forms for his provisions. Some were successful in it and some are still trying hard to meet their both ends. Part time job is one of those different forms of works i. e. doing jobs at a place for few hours and being payed for it, from which billions of people are earning their provisions. Generally, it is done to have that extra cheese or cream in your life, which will make your life more tempting and attractive. But sometimes it is done to meet all the expenses at the end of the month, and in fewer exceptions people do it as a hobby. Turning their spare time in the form of cash. Nothing is perfect in this world so same is the scenario with part time job. It has its good part and worst ones too. Good part is that you have a little bit handsome amount of money in your hands in short time. you are not spending your time like a couch potato. High turnovers, no consistency in quality are few of the ones to be highlited.",B1.2
"I don't think it is ""important"" for college students to have a part-time job, but it could be a good and useful experience to learn. Before one being hired for a part-time job, he/she needs to know how to search a one, like surfing on the internet, the wanted ads in the store, or introduced by friends or families. This is an experience. One can also learn that what kind of jobs is suitable for him/her how's the possibility of being hired, and so on. When one is hired for a part-time job, one can earn money for himself/herself; this is indeed an ""income"" not from parents. Other than money, there are also many things to study and to gain. If it's a clerk in drink-selling shop, one can learn how to make a cup of drink by adding different fluids in a specific ratio, how to deal with customers if they have special needs. Or if it's a teaching assistant in cram school, one can use his/her knowledge of English or math to help students in learning. When students have learned the concept or solved the questions in exam, he/she would also be very happy in this process. Part-time jobs can provide different experiences besides money. However, one can also spend the same time doing other things, like clubs in school, courses like learning language, camps helping residents living in distant areas, etc. If one is still learning, his/her college life will not be meaningless. So I say it is a good experience to have a part-time job, but not a necessary thing to do in college life, especially if one is not short of money.",B1.2
"Nowadays, college students want to have a part-time job during their study periods. In my opinion, I think everything has two aspects like one coin has two sides. On the one hand, if you want to gain more experiences in society, to have a part-time job is a good way, but on the other hand, in case you pay more attention on your part-time job that you don't have enough times on your study lessons, for a college student, study is most important for a student. Most college students believe a part-time job can support their more job chances in the future, and it also can improve a person's confidence and responsibility. So in this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. There are other college students believe that college is a study place, so they consider that if we spend much time in doing a part-time job, we may delay our school works, in this aspect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. From now on, college becomes more and more market focus and a college student must be provided with variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities.",A2

"Whether smoking ban at all restaurant was a controversial issue in the territory. There are both pros and cons of this policy. For me, I am on of the advocators. In this essay, I would like to air my view on the benefits of the issue. To start with, implementing smoking ban can improve the working condition of the catering service workers. reducing the exposed time to the second-hand smoke of the waiters and waitresses. That's to say. the smoking ban can help protect the health of the workers, lowering the chance of suffering from respirstory diseases and even lung cancer. What's more, the health of the general public can also be safeguarded. This is very dangerous that the non-smokers always have to suffer from the second-hand smoke of the smoking caters, especially for pregnant women and small children because their immunity is weaker. Thus, while the smoking ban is put into force, their health can also be protected. More importantly, the policy can improve the reputation of Hong Kong as a clean city. With less people smoking in Hong Kong, the air quality in Hong Kong will certainly become better. Therefore, Hong Kong will become a more attractive city for the tourists. As a result, the general image of Hong Kong as an international and healthy city will be further promoted. Conclusively speaking, there are many benefits of the policy. By prohibiting smoking at all restaurant, I am convinced our citizens' health and city's image can be improved.",B1.1
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. For modern college students, it is useful to have a part-time job. There are many benefits of having a part-time job. Students who have a part-time job are easier to be accepted by enterprises. To modern enterprises, diploma is not the only way to text the employee, working experience is become more and more important when a leader decides whether the employee to get the job or not. For example, a graduate with high diploma but no working experience and another with a common diploma but have rich experience, which one would you like? If I'm the leader, I'll choose the second without hesitation. Maybe someone will oppose me, students' duty is study, isn't it? I think that's middle school's students' duty, and college students' duty is not only study but learn more principles when you live. Have a part-time job is a good chance to learn!To me, I really want to have a part-time job, but I never find it because I'm too lazy.

"I think smoking should be completely banned at all at the restaurant in Japan because I h ave three below the opinion. First thing is that cigarette has it itself. It is the effect of passive smoking. Passive smoking injures the people around a smoker without their volition. And passive smoking has more harmful than active smoking. Second, now most restaurant separate smoking seat and nonsmoking one. But it cannot separ ate SMOKE. It floats anywhere. Only perfect locked room can do it, however, it doesn't real ize in the restaurant in Japan. And more smoking seat often is near the bathroom in the Japa nese restaurant. So many people-baby, child, pregnant woman, and elder- have to pass near th e smoking seat, of course, if they don't smoke. I mean, nonsmokers feel so bad because of s mokers. It resemble that the noise of in the train. For example, the loudly talk, the leak o f sound from earphone and the call on the cell phone. Finally, the climate in Japan is becoming Non-smoking.

"I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As you can see, many students in college do part-time jobs, and what the real feeling of them is that they learned a lot when they do their part-time jobs. College students live in school, in which they can just learn some theories. When they graduate from school, they know little about how to earn their living by themselves. They don't know how to use their knowledge in their work. So, it is important for college student to learn how to face to the individual life. Also, if college students try to do some part-time work, they can also reduce some pressure of their parents. Most of college students are adults, they are supposed to afford their fare in their life. Maybe parents do not want you to do a part-time job because they worry that you will be really tired if you do a extra job when you are busy to studying. But as a adult, college student must learn to balance them. What's more, college students have a lot of spare time, if we do some part-time jobs, our spare time will be full of happiness. And it will urge us to study more efficiently. Because of the reason mentioned above, I think it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"Yes, smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants in the country. For Singapore's case, there have been designated areas outside of the restaurants for patrons who smoke. Whoever, I believe more can be done. By having smoking areas outside of the restaurants, other passersby may be affected by the fumes from these patrons. Thus, I believe there should be an elimination of smoking anywhere around the premises so that all patrons can enjoy fresh and clean air no matter where they seat. Some restaurants such as PS Cafe at Dempsey have designated their smoking area at the top of their building but I believe that patrons who may want to have a good view of the city may be affected by these smokers. Second hand smoke is one of the causes of cancer, which has been reiterated time and again. Thus, an absolute abolishment should deter people from picking this unhealthy habit. By not allowing restaurants to have any form of smoking will eventually give these patrons a reason to kick the habit so as to socialize with their compatriots. And so, I believe that Singapore is on the right track to banning smoking at all restaurants but more could be done. Perhaps in the new future when smoking has been eradicated, everyone will have a wonderful dining experience. ",B2
"A Minute of Heaven and an Hour of Hell The health problem brought by smoking is not a new issue for the most of us. We were flooded with news and reports dealing with the harmful effects of the use of cigarettes. Also there had been innumerable protests and undertakings launched to prohibit smoking on public places. And now, with the calling to ban smoking on restaurants all over the country, I am now ready to take my part. I do agree to ban smoking on all restaurants in the country for the following reasons: First: restaurants are public places and smoking on public places entails hazardous effects not just on the smoker himself but also to the other people on those public places, because even non-smoker might inhale the smoke produce from the use of cigarettes, which as we know, brought several lung diseases. Second: it is very disrespectful and ungentle to smoke while other people are having a good time in their lunch or dinner. Third: restaurant is a place for people to eat and not a place for people to smoke. Banning smoking on restaurants might also lessen the number of people who suffer from lung diseases caused by the different chemicals contained even in a single stick.",B1.2
" I fully agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. In fact, in some countries it has been written in the law and is being carried out now. My reasons are chiefly as follows. First, smoking is harmful to the smoker's health. According to the recent survey, those who smoke are much more likely to get lung cancer than those who don't and every year many people are dying due to diseases caused by smoking habit. In this case, we should not smoke for the sake of our health. Second, smoking not only do harm to the person who smokes but also the tremendous people who suffer from passive smoking. The supporters of smoking often claim that smoking is a kind of personal lifestyle that others even the government should not interfere. However, in my opinion, if you smoke in public places like restaurants, it's no more a personal matter and it not only harm other people's health but also creates a terrible environment for others. Last but not least, if you smoke in public places like restaurants, chances are that a big fire might break out and then threatens the safety of thousands of people. Therefore, no matter it is for your own health or the others', smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the country and it is high time that the government took effective measures to solve the problem.",B1.1
"It is somewhat surprising to me that smoking has not already been banned at restaurants in Japan given how forward-thinking the image of that country is. Smoking cigarettes is a kind of old fashioned habit which lingers because the tobacco industry is quite large and makes a large amount of revenue. Furthermore, the government makes a large amount of money from putting taxes on cigarettes, and as a result, I do not see a good solution to this problem. Large corporations seem to be singularly skilled in keeping their profits high no matter what the costs upon the health or life styles of the people who use their products. Japanese corporations may be even more guilty of this than American corporations, and so it would seem that banning smoking at restaurants in Japan would be more difficult than it was for some states that the United States. Smoking also seems to bear more cultural importance in Japan than it does in the US, and so although I think personally that banning smoking at restaurants in Japan would be a good idea, I do not think that we will see a solution on this issue any time in the near future.",C2
"With the development of human being, the level of our living standard is improving very fast. College students have more allowance, but whether they need to take a part-time job is a heated discussion. In my opinion, taking a part-time job is meaningful to students now. First of all, taking a part time job can release the burden on the shoulder of parents. Since most of our college students are completely be adults, we should take our responsibility to ourselves and try to make live for ourselves. We need our part-time jobs. Furthermore, taking part-time job can help us know the society in advance. We all should live in the society and no one can live alone in twenty-first century. We ought to learn how the society works and what we need to adapt ourselves to the society. Fortunately, if we make mistake when we are doing our part-time job, it may cost less. Thus, part-time job gives us a chance to make mistake and can teach us a lesson without much pay. Last but not least, part-time job can let us know the difficulties of making living. Since we were born to the world, we depend on our parents and ask for living. We never know how hard our parents work and how heavy the living burden on the shoulder of our parents. Part-time jobs can let us know these. In one word, part- time is a good choice for students in college. In my opinion, this is a chance.",B1.2

" This time, a great many university students choose to do part-time job during their leisure time. The desire for this is quite different, some for the financial aid, some for the working experience. Even, there are many people who just want to learn to how to adjust to the cruel social competition. Here I'd like to say something about my point of view. Firstly, from doing part-time, you can learn many things that we can't get in book. During working, you start to find out how hard to survive, to live on one's own. This will bring a lot of benefits to our future while the others are complaining about the hard pressure. Moreover, if the part-time job is concerned with your major, it will put your knowledge into practice. That's would be excellent advantage when you take part in an interview when the company takes the working experience seriously. There is no doubt that part-time job will make you more independent from your parents and family. However, every coin has two sides. Part-time job will surely take lots of time, not only spare time, but also your study time. So there is an annoying question which is faced with you: how to keep a balance between the work and study? Speak personally, I tend to put study in the first. For your job is student, your main task is to study, to get higher grade, not just for the money that seem to make your present life more comfortable. In conclusion, if once I am about to do the part-time job, I will see does it have anything to do with my major or does it cover too much time. Anyway, study while doing the job is my hope.",B1.2
"In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, students gain work experience before they enter the society. In this way, they can find what they are really interested in. By touching a variety of part-time jobs, they make their own decision. On the other hand, if they want to study graduate school, they can easily know what they want to major in. In addition, having a part-time job is helpful for university students' time management. For instance, they have to strike a balance between school and work. Also, this will help them to handle their business orderly and further have free time with friends. Finally, students know the difficulty of making a living. Most of their expenses are given by their parents so they don't have to worry about tuition. Take my friend for an example. She is the youngest one in her family and she relies on them or friends very much. Whatever she does, she used to find someone to help her. Although she is an adult in law right now, she is still childish. If she has a part-time job while study in college, she would be more mature. In brief, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because they can gain experience and learn how to make their time management, they even become mature after taking the job. Above reasons, it is necessary for them to take a part-time job.",B1.1
"We must first understand that smoking is a largely harmful activity, bringing diseases to the smoker and is a nuisance to others. However, many are still addicted to the habit of smoking, and feel the urge to smoke frequently. Banning smoking in all restaurants gives non-smokers a smoke-free environment to dine. For the smokers, however, it means that they will have to either stop their smoking habit while dining, or excuse themselves to find alternative locations to smoke during meals. As smoking is a die-hard habit, the latter is usually more prominent. Additionally, we have to understand the motivation behind banning smoking in all restaurants. Is it because the government wants to reduce the harm that smoke brings to non-smokers? Or is it due to the fact that the government wants to eradicate the habit of smoking in its population by setting up barriers to smoking? If the former is the case, the new law might help, ensuring a smoke-free dining environment. However, if the latter is the case, it might have very limited effects. Ban smoking in restaurants, and smokers will take their smoking to another place. As long as the intention of smoking is there, smokers will find a way to do so, unless if there is a strong barrier set up. Banning in restaurants only is, however, not a strong one. As such, I believe that whether to ban smoking in all restaurants depends on the motivation behind it, and whether there are any complementary policies to support the motivation. ",B2
"Part-time job is a job that uses few times to do and little money given too. There are many works of part-time job, such as selling hamburgers at McDonalds, selling ice cream at Dairy Queens, selling books, serving foods at restaurant or working at your home with the internet.

"Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? Yes, it should. Some smokers may feel that their freedom of smoking is limited, but smoking in public places especially in restaurants may give rise to some problems. It is widely accepted that smoking does harm to our health. Smoking can increase the possibility of catching some cancers. According to some international surveys, the number of people who died of cancers related to smoking is increasing rapidly over the years. What's more, smoking influences not only the health of smokers, but also the second-hand smokers'. The ban on smoking at all the restaurants can certainly reduce the effect of second-hand smoking. In this way, it is a quite reasonable rule that all the customers should obey. To ban smoking in restaurants can also help educate the teenagers. As we all know, the number of teenagers who smoke is rising rapidly. Instead of telling the children that it is not a good habit to smoke, the non-smoking signs in the restaurants can lead the children to recognize the dangers more easily. Of course, it is of great significance for a successful restaurant to keep a clean and comfortable atmosphere. The customers may feel uncomfortable and uneasy when exposed to the smoke in the restaurants. How can a restaurant provide a satisfactory service to its customers when the customers feel a sense of not being at home? After all, restaurants are public places to eat and enjoy ourselves, the smoke can easily affect the quality of a restaurants' service. Given these reasons, we can now draw a conclusion that the ban on smoking at all the restaurants is reasonable and necessary.",B2
"There are two reasons to why smoking should be banned in restaurants. The first reason would be because of health purposes. A lot of people have already died suffering from diseases caused by the smoke. And it is not a quick, funny death. The death will be a slow, painful one - torturing one's mind and soul. So many organ dysfunctions can be the result from smoking cigarettes, pot, and also weed. Pancreas, liver, lungs, kidneys and some other body parts can all be shut down after consistently smoking for some time. Smoking in restaurants should be banned because the air inside the restaurant is tightly packed. When smokers light up their cigars, the smoke will tend to spread inside the room, therefore, polluting the small, full of foods area. I do believe the smokers tend to think they are cool when they are smoking, light up a match, put it on the smoke and blow the smoke to someone's face ain't cool to me though. It's a form of disrespect. Some are smoking usually for the sake of being relaxed. They will find living difficult old years of age if one is a heavy smoker even if it is during his/her young years. Moreover, there are people who will suffer more than the smoker itself. These people are the ones who inhale the smoke after the smoker exhales it. We call them the second hand smokers. You see, there is no benefit when smoking cigarettes. To prevent these kinds of tragic incidents, government should ban the production and supply of cigarettes, pot, weed and all other kinds of guilty pleasures in their local civilization. They should also prevent importing these.",B1.2
"I think smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. Smoking is very bad for your body. I don't like smoking because it makes me cough and it makes my throw hurt very badly. I don't like it when my friends smoke around me because the same thing happens. I don't understand how they can breathe that stuff into their lungs, because it is full of bad stuff and makes your mouth very dry. It also makes your teeth yellow and makes your clothes stink. Even some of my girlfriends who are smokers who think they don't smell bad still have the cigarette smoke smell around them. This makes it hard to be in the car with them or otherwise be around them. I bet that a lot of young Japanese girls feel the same way as I do. I bet that they think it would be a good idea to ban smoking especially in restaurants. Otherwise, they probably would not have asked me this question. Smoking is also bad for your clothes. It makes them smell bad, and if you get ash on them it is very difficult to get it off. Also, all the boys I talked to say that they do not like to kiss girls who smoke, so I think that is a good reason to have abstained from smoking too.",C2
"A part-time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. There are many reasons for working part time, including the desire to do so, having one's hours cut back by an employer and being unable to find a full-time job. ""Part-time"" can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes only a few courses, rather than a full load of course work each semester. Having a part time job is important to student because it can help them use their income wisely. Through their part time job they can buy all the things they want and all the things they need without asking money to their parents. Having a part time job is also an experience it can help us develop our skills in working. It can also refer as our practice in the near future and having a part time job can help think or find the ideal job that suite to us. Also to the students like me if I have a part time job I can minimize my spending. I will learn to save some money so that whenever I like to buy some things I can have it right away. At the same time you can practice your interpersonal relationship.",B1.2
"Nowadays, the society cannot emphasize the important than to quit smoking. It is universally acknowledged that Smoking is harmful to your health. However, whether smoking should be permitted in the restaurants or not is a serious problem to think over. There are about two sides followed about this, most people include me insist on that any public area, like restaurant, must stay away from smoking. Smoke is not only terrible for people's lungs, but also the spark maybe causes a fire. At the same time, people should observe common courtesy when they in the public places, and try their best not to affect others activity. If they are smoking, the others will feel uncomfortable without doubt. Standing on these disadvantages, they hope the country banned at all the restaurants completely. Despite its merits, it also brings some problems to solve. For instance, someone, especially some adult male addicts to cigarette, they have dinner at the restaurant sometime, maybe they thought the dinner cannot without smoke, so that they cannot help themselves to use lighters. So, I rarely reach an absolute consensus on such a controversial issue. After a thorough consideration, I suggest that the country can set the majority of restaurants without any smoke, at the same time let the minority of allowed to smoke. Only in this way, I think, maybe can solve this complicated problem.",B1.1
"It is not surprising anymore when seeing people carrying a cigarette in their hands no matter whether they are elderly or even teenagers. Many of the university students are also smoking during their university life. Not surprisingly, students do not think that smoking is unhealthy. The age of first attempt of smoking even shows a dropping trend these days. It is not a healthy scenario. Researchers have proved that cigarettes will emit numerous toxic and hazardous particles which cause serious health problem to smokers and even people around them. Although banning smoking at restaurants, for example, may show disrespect to current smoker, it is still necessary to ban smoke in order to protect the victims of second handed smoke. Government should as well put more effort in promoting a smoke-free city and educating the next generation. Meanwhile, measures in supporting people quitting smoking should not be ignored. Without those measures, easily people will begin smoking again. As a result, stop smoking will become meaningless. In conclusion, I do think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.",B1.2
"I strongly believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is a very normal phenomenal in Singapore, from young to old, but the main reason why smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants is because smoking doesn't only harm the smoker but also the surrounding people. Statistics shows that, second-hand smoker are more likely to have lung cancer compared to those who smoke. But why is it so? It is because every single path of cigarettes the smoker take is filtered by the filter, but every single intake by the second-hand smoker are not. Beside health matters, smoking will also cause air pollution to the surrounding. Most of the non-smokers thinks that it is smelly when someone smoke around them. Try putting yourself in their shoes, imagine one day you are happily having a meal with you love one and out of a sudden the guy sitting beside u start smoking and keep blowing the smoke to you table, how will you feel? Will you think that the smell is good and continue smelling it? The answer is no, even you think that it doesn't really matters, how about your partner? Your partner might find it annoying or disturbing. Lastly I strongly support the idea of ""Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country"". ",B1.2
"Many people love to smoke. The smell and feeling are their favorites. But there are also a big group of people don't like cigarettes. They believe that cigarettes would harm their bodies. That's true. According science reports, cigarettes content lots of chemical substances that would harm your lungs and even lead to cancers. They also have influences to other parts of body and make you weaker day after day. And two-hand-smoking is much worse to ours health. Thankfully, there are not so many people like to smoke in recent years. The government has also set the law to protect un-smoking people, hoping that smokers can change their habits. The rule is that smokers are not allowed to smoke in public areas anymore, such as offices, train stations and restaurants. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Not only banned for health reason but also give respect to un-smokers. Not everyone can stand that kind of smell. But restaurants can still have smoking room or area for smoker to enjoy both their habits and food. Other public areas also can have the same design for smokers. People in 21st centaury become more polite to other persons and respect each other. That remote the country to improve.",B1.1
"In today's world, a part-time job is starting to become common even before college such as in high school or in some rare cases even before that. This goes to show the kids are getting more responsible overall, and so it would make sense to say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as well. In today's world, the fact that so many young kids have part-time jobs should be a motivation for those that do not to keep up with their peers. Next, college students these days probably have more personal and tuition expenses than those in the generation of our parents, and so we should help our parents out at least in spirit by getting a part-time job to show them that we are investing in our own educations as well. There are also many people who claim that having a part-time job takes valuable time that a student should spend studying away from them. In some ways I agree with this, but I think that most kids today are good enough at multitasking to handle balancing a variety of activities and uses of their time. Things in the world keep getting faster and faster, and if we do not change to keep up with them, we will fall behind.",C2
"Currently, in the college have many students came from poor family. They don't have money enough to spend about their studying. Therefore they would have a part-time job for making money themselves, except getting their parents. In this essay will talk about advantage of a part time job such as they can have money enough for their spence and help their parents. Their studying in the college, they need to have money to spend about studying, their life, report and homework and so on. Therefore having a part time job is important for college students, because it can help them get money to spend about their studying and life in the college. Moreover, they will have more ability as well. Having a part time job, they can make money by themselves. Therefore they have money to pay with studying and don't worry their parents. Moreover, if they have a good job, they can give their some money to parents as well. In conclusion, the students came from poor family. They don't have money enough to spend about their studying.

"In my opinion, overtime work will may have no the importance? necessary for a student who has wealthy position, do not lack about of money, but, it is will significant, and very necessary for a student who have poor position, First of all, overtime work regards the thing that is lawful, and the work that everybody can do besides the school hours, be taking time free to the advantage, and the important factor most of overtime work, be, overtime work can help to lighten the load in about of expenses that connects with the education has of a student by oneself, For example, The parents of a student cannot make money in on schedule time, while a student has to use money, for the education, then, It may make a student loses opportunity that good education way, because, have no money, but, if, a student works the overtime, a student has will the saving deposit, and a student can spend this money comes to be way education expenses, moreover, still can help a father and mother economize expenses well, besides, I think, overtime work, be learning will have to live go together accompany experience life new accumulation that from the work, give can live stay get with oneself.

Famous quote about smoking is smoking is injurious to health smoking effects human health very badly. Smoking acts a person for human health. People smoke cigarettes of tobacco mostly. Some people smoke others then tobacco. Smoking acts as a poison for health. As it is a poison so how people are get involved in it. Mostly people start it has fashion. Then feel themselves superior then other people who are not smoking. But with the passage of time they feel that they achieve a mental calm while smoking. So whenever they need to eliminate any tension they start smoking. After that it becomes a habit for them. Smoking is injurious to health because the smoke affects the human lungs due to permanent smoking. In old ages mostly the smoking people are involved in lungs cancer. There are many other diseases that are caused by smoking such as blood pervious problem many heart diseases and mental abnormality. if doctors tell some person to avoid from smoking then it is very difficult for that person but he has not any other option for that. He need to abide by the instructions of doctor otherwise his diseases will be com worse and his life will become a Burdon of him. Many people leave this habit after any problem they again start enjoying their life. Smoking is prohibited at public places because other people feel unhappy due to smoke. so there is no benefit of smoking. All that has been discussed is about the losses due to smoking so any person who want to enjoy his life should avoid smoking.,B1.2
"I agree with the statement to a certain extent, but I will focus on the analyzing the benefits. It could be said that the job of a student is too study, and he should work hard at it. Yet, this job is one that comes with no salary and furthermore is a job that one usually pays to do. Thus, especially with college students who pay high school fees, many students do indeed take up a part time job to earn their way through college or for some pocket money. There are indeed certain benefits in doing so. For example, the working student would experience first-hand the working conditions of whatever job he is in, and perhaps have a clearer understanding of work. This is in comparison to the naive student who enters the workforce without prior work experience; he passed through his college education without a good understanding of the next stage of his life. Having a part time job, out of necessity or not, could be seen as a complement to a scholarly education. Friends I know have said that once you start work, you would understand the freedom you have while in college. On the other hand it seems that most college students cannot wait to start work. Working and studying at the same time would allow you to compare these 2 activities and allow one to come to a more mature understanding of his purposes in these activities. This I feel is a benefit of primary importance. ",B2
"Pakistan is a country full of color and zest, rich in culture. Our culture's foundation lies in the strong family unit. The sort of bonding we promote, family ties we have are scarce in the west. Here we believe in taking care of our kith and kin. Our cultural norm is that parents support their children all through their life. They raise us, educate us, provide for us, arrange our weddings for us, and then pamper our kids as well. In such scenario, I strongly feel that part time jobs are not fit for our culture, neither for our family units, nor for our society. It is western concept that parents must ask their kids to leave the house and live on their own once they turn eighteen. For them and their youngsters it is necessary that that they opt for part time jobs, earn for themselves. It is inevitable for them and vital for their survival as well. On the other hand our culture is a reflection of warmth. Parents take their kids as small chicks and keep them under their wings, safe from the heat and cold of the world, until they feel that chicks are ready to survive on their own. This generally is never. Since our culture does not enforce any such responsibilities, we do not need any part time jobs. We want our kids to give complete attention to their studies before they begin to worry about earning.",B1.1
"I agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All people can do to go to the restaurant, and All people do not smoking. So smoker is less than that. therefore, they can not smoking at all the restaurants. Such as, if one family visit to the restaurant. They are 4 members in the family: father, mother, one boy, and baby girl. And there are many smokers, so smokers are near the family. We can defend our health, happiness, and freedom. Maybe, young boy will learn smoking to smoker and baby will drink air with smoke from smoker. Young boy and baby can be your sun and daughter, It is very danger and make to get angry to you. Next, some countries use fire on the table, such as Korean soup, Japanese soup, and United Kingdom royal dessert. So, Today, In this food restaurants, we can see fire on the table. If you smoke in there space, your smoke fire is near gas. We know smoking near fire is very danger.

"In the context of Singapore, it is a good experience for college students to have a part time job, but it is not important - unless, the student happens to be from a lower income family with difficulties paying for school fees. Engaging in a part time job will give one more exposure of the industry. Students interested to pursue a career in a particular industry can hold a part time job in that particular industry to gain more experience and apply what he/she is learning in school to work. It can help the student figure out whether he/she really wants to pursue a career in that industry after graduation. However, in the context of Singapore, most universities degree makes internships compulsory. Students will be exposed to the industry during the academic life sooner or later. To have a part time job in the specific industry is therefore, not important. Yet, one's family and financial background needs to be considered. Not everyone can afford school fees and sometimes government subsidies are still not enough. For students from lower income family who might require to take a bank loan to pay for school fees, securing a part time job would be important, to help the family cope with living expenses. ",B1.2
"Restaurants in where all people enjoy dishes are not private place but public place. It is various people in there; adults and children, family and couple, gentle men and women, noisy men and women, smoker and non-smoker, for instance. So if you have lunch in restaurant, you should think feelings of around people in there. If you are smoker, it is most important that think thinking of non-smoker. In fact, I think smoke of cigarettes harm taste of foods. And smoke of cigarettes harms growth of children in restaurant. People who want to smoke should smoke out of room after mealtime. Then smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For example, McDonald's near my home prohibits smoking in store because McDonald's think that smoke is obstacle for good taste of hamburger. It is very good idea! And it is truth for smoker that smoke harms dishes. So in now, some restaurants have sheets for smoker, but all restaurants should abolish the sheet, if they want all people to enjoy good dishes. Finally I want all restaurants to prohibit smoking in it and all people agree this thinking and enjoy food and conversation peaceful, cheerful in it.",A2
"I don't agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at all. This is not because I am a smoker. In fact, I don't smoke at all and hate smoking. Then, there are some reasons why I think so. These days, it is very often said that smoking is not good for our health and smoking tend to get a cancer. However, many people smoke in spite of the advice. In addition, there is an opinion that when nonsmokers breathe the smoke of cigarette, nonsmokers tend to get a cancer more than smoker tend to do. Only because of these reasons, it is too one-sided to adapt smoker to nonsmoker. In restaurants, if they ban smoking in all areas, people who want to smoke can't smoke and if they put up with smoking, they can't enjoy themselves and maybe they feel bad. I think that it is good to make the partition wall or the partition room that separate smokers from nonsmokers. When we do it, it isn't one-sided and it is a fair solution, I think. In restaurants these days, some make such things and shop assistants ask us whether we smoke or not or which seats we sit down. So, it is nice to be complete. Therefore, there is no necessity to be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2

Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to your field of study, will give you an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that you have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that you have had some real-world, adult experiences and that you can handle yourself outside of the classroom and off campus. The top part time jobs for college students include computer lab assistants, administrative assistant, aerobic instructors, print center attendants, library assistant. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus.

"I think that it is important for college students to have part-time job because part-time job may give them precious experiences. First of all, they could know work is very hard and important. They could notice that their parents do works everyday for their family. And they may thank their parents. We can't live without works. Second, they are taught importance of money by getting salary by their self. Most of them may often save money when they go shopping because they don't want to lose the money they get hard. They may plan how to use it, for example traveling, shopping and their hobby. Third, their experiences will be useful when they get a job after graduate from their college.

"Recently, there's a widespread concern over the issue that smoking in public should be banned or not. In my point of view, I'm really for the voice of banning public smoking. It is known to all that smoking does bad to human's body seriously. It is very harmful to our health. It will also increase the risk of getting horrible diseases. If one smokes in public, he will make other people around him breathe second-hand smoke. Other people will feel very uncomfortable. Also, their health will be damaged. Last but not least, smoking in public also cause a lot of environment problems. Many smokers just throw the unsmoked part of the cigarette away on the road or some other places nearby such as flower pots. It looks so disgusting. In some dry places, throwing fired cigarettes away even makes it easier to get on fire. To conclude, smoking in public is really bad to others. It not only pollutes the air, but also does harm to people's health and safe. So, in my opinion, smoking in public should be banned really and people who do not obey the banning rules should be punished seriously. Also, a ban on smoking in public places would also help reduce health care costs. Fewer people would need to be treated for the lung maladies that result from breathing in the smoke exhaled by others.",B1.2

First, restaurants are usually indoor place and smoke indoor place pollute indoor air. This will be extremely harmful for the people who do not smoke. Smoking in the restaurant threatens non-smoker's health and it is unacceptable. Non-smoker's right to be health should be protected. Second, the smell of smoke make flavor of food worse. Restaurant customers smell smoke rather than delicious food. Also, smoke make restaurant dirty. Chemicals in the smoke make indoor dirty. Both of those facts will be big damage for restaurant. For the better environment of restaurant, smoke in the restaurant should be forbidden. Some people can argue that right of smokers should be protected.

"Part-time jobs are needed by many people especially since we are facing poverty here in the Philippines. There are so many part-time jobs that are offered here like being a tutor, a cashier, a waiter, a dancer, a singer, a dj. It opens up opportunities for people who don't have jobs. It is also a source of extra income for those who are not satisfied with the money they are earning. For example, a business man that has a talent for dancing can enter a part-time job as a choreographer.

"I agree that. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because two reasons. First, we must study except for academic things, too. After graduation, many of them will be pushed for time as a true member of society. But it's very hard to take part in a society without arrangements. So I think we should have a part-time job as arrangements of a member of society. There are many important things which we can study only through the working. And we must know how money is precious. If we live by only parent's income, and get allowances, we can't realize real value. However we understand its value in mind, it's nonsense. Seeing is believing. We can realize it precious only own experience. Second, I think we should do something while we are college students because for many students campus life is final time which they can use freely. For example traveling abroad, to learn how to drive, however they are very expensive. So we need a lot of money. But its true value rise when we carry out from preparation of money to practice on our own. I think we can spend time efficiently this series of flow by having a part-time job. 4 years is too short to waste.",A2
" Nowadays more and more Chinese college students begin to find the importance of independence, maybe because they could learn more from the abroad.

So trying to find some part time jobs to do is sometimes regarded as an important step to enter the society. But at the same time, we can't make it good to find the suitable job or solve other problems as we are faced with the society at first time and have little experience. Also there are many cases on the crime that teens were used to do terrible things by some adults. What's more, if students use more time in studying, they may get more than washing dishes.

"Nowadays, there are many university or college students who has part time during their study, because they should pay hundreds or thousands dollars for their college fees, and sometimes they spend the rest of their earnings for their food or gas fee. It is good for them because they can start to familiarize themselves with actual working atmospheres, but actually having part time job is not very good for them. They should go for work after their lessons, and they have no more time to do their assignments. Part time job, especially in the evening, also makes students easily got fatigue, because it decreases their rest time, and makes them tired and sleepy at the campus in the next morning, especially for the students who often have their study in front of computer. Part time job also distracts our studying routines and makes us difficult to manage our time. Sometimes students cannot decide which one is more important and should be preceded, studying at the campus or working. In my opinion, it is not important for us to be too fast to start working, because we can get working experience during projects period that is provided by our university or college.",B1.2
"Cigarette smoke contains over 4, 000 chemicals. Of those chemicals, 40 of them have been proven to cause cancer (SWAT). It's no wonder why a bill is being passed to ban smoking in all public places. However, this will have the greatest effect on restaurants across the nation. The next great smoking debate will decide whether you can ""puff"" in restaurants. In a democracy, like the one we live in, the majority rules, while trying to respect the rights of the minority. In this case, the minority being smokers, seem to have more rights than the majority. But the majority has taken it into their owns hands and passed a bill to ban smoking in all public places. The ban would only apply to the common areas of the restaurants, especially if the dining areas were enclosed and had a separate entrance. Smoking, however, might be prohibited in a lobby if a nearby restaurant wasn't enclosed. The restaurants should consider how to manage the place for smoking as well as place for eating. That shouldn't be together. I agree to ban smoking in the restaurants but as the same way it is doesn't need to be all restaurants if they can manage well.",A2
"I disagree with the statement. This is because as students, it is our job to study and focus on what we are doing. Doing a part-time job at the same time will drain our energy and attention while we are in school. I have friends who were always pre-occupied with making money and holding several part-time jobs who frequently skipped school so that he could go for his job. In the end, towards the examinations their grades suffered and could not graduate in time. Further some of the jobs such as delivering flyers and knocking on every house to make sales of products is a very tiring job and when students go to school the following day they are often too tired to pay attention in school, and can always be seen sleeping in class. This defeats the purpose of going to school in the first place. As students we should enjoy being students, spend within our limits, be contend with what our parents provide us and not compare with our peers. We should not hold part-time jobs. The positive side of the students that have a part-time job is that I find that they are much more mature due to the working experience that they have. 207 words ",B1.2
"Smoking in public places such as restaurants is inappropriate for not only themselves, but everyone around them. Though there are some restaurants that has smoking/non smoking areas, I believe smoking should not be allowed where others are trying to eat their food and enjoy themselves. Smoking in general is very unhealthy for you, causing many types of cancers, dental health and many more, and it can damage someone else's health by smoking near them. Some cases show others who dealt with second hand smoke have had serious health problems, such as heart failure and breathing problems. When smoking in a place where people are eating, it can be such a distraction. Eating your food and all of a sudden smelling the cigarette smoke, losing your appetite. Smoke can travel far, and for the ones who are non smokers will notice. Children are in most danger of this occurring. When young children are exposed to second hand smoke, it can really damage them internally, and may face harder health issues when they are older. Smoking in restaurants also can effect its employees. I don't believe they enjoy taking someone's order and having intoxicated smoke in their faces. And they may work there all the time, being exposed to smokers everyday, and damaging their health little by little. I personally will not enjoy working where customers can smoke in their corners while others eat. Smoking in restaurants should not be an option. They should get rid of smoking areas and have the restaurant not allow smoking inside at all. If others want to smoke, they can go outside, simple as that. Even better, they can start to quit, saving themselves from horrible side effects. If our country got rid of smoking areas in most public places, it can save others from effects it brings on non smokers, and maybe encourage smokers themselves to quit.",B1.2
"Increase unemployment society, a part-time job is very important for every school students. Because many students don't know who am I and what do I do in my future. Doing the Part-time job, they find their job that exact fit their personality. Because they will know many kind of jobs and each jobs tasks and what is the fittest on my character. The part-time job makes them realized our society include value of money. Many students didn't know society. So they always say ""I'm going to earn big money. "" or ""I'm going to do work as self-employee. "" Some answers it's true but many students haven't plan and didn't know their position. The part-time job can help to find their position. And the Part-time job is training independence and changing spending habit. My parents make me do Part-time job. It's true my home doesn't have much money for raise children. That moment the part-time job annoying me but that moment my parents don't care about my spending. So I changed my habit of spend and I learned independence. The part-time job is important to our future as that reasons. So we have to do a lot of type part-time job in young age.",A2
"College students should become creative and responsible with themselves. They must know what is good or bad and must learn not to depend on their parents always. As a college student, I know that part-time job is an important way of helping parents. Even though I am not a working student I can really say that it is very big helping to every student especially those who have financial problems. They are learning how to be independent and more responsible to their selves. I admire those students because they are very responsible of managing their time for their school and for their work. But aside of a big help to the student and to the family, there are also an effect to the student. He/she might encounter some problems to his/her study. Yes it is good that you can to your parents but if you know they can support your financial needs maybe it is advisable if you just focus on your study and not to work for yourself. At the first place it is the responsibility of your parents to send you on the school. But if there are financial problems to your family, then it is the right time for you to become a working student. I know it is hard to become a working a student and it is not bad because sometimes it is a measurement on how a student become more responsible to their selves. I salute every working student because they are a good example and a good role model to the youth.",B1.2
"A rising and common concern amongst college students nowadays is getting employed into a good company, especially with the increase in competition and demand. They find themselves mostly under qualified for the job they aspire, and so they resort to part-time jobs. Part-time jobs, not only do they give students a background in the work environment or OJT (on-the-job training), but also consume only a small amount of their time, allowing them to still be able to focus on their academics. In my opinion, part-time jobs are not required, but highly recommended for any college student. The working experience comes in handy when it comes to entering a professional working atmosphere or a similar job. As an accounting student, I volunteered myself to get summer and part-time jobs at a real estate firm. Though my occupation may not necessarily align with my future aspirations, the learning experience I gain is extremely helpful. It has not only taught me how things are supposed to be inside an office, but also the flow of work, the sense of professionalism, and the dedication to work. Basing it mostly from subjective input, I do highly recommend and agree that college students have part-time jobs.",B1.2
"Working part time is doing at free time. I think that students should do this work because it can make us experience. Furthermore I can help my parent while they toil every day. Although I would do this work, I know learning the most important. I should take time out right. Some people must not do this work, they will not have freedom. However, I am not change their idea. In addition to doing work I can give for time with reading. In doing this work, it can make me parent when they tried for me. But learning I should not quite so. Although I can do in pairs together. I should look after health my own, so should not heavy work. Student must have duty to learn and consequently good effective. But doing part time which everyone can use knowledge of their own and apply into work. In addition to applying can help me for learning in class or not teacher. I can learn form do part time and share knowledge of friends. However, learning are important more than do work, they should do in pairs together. Also, if you think to work you may be make yourself diligent and manage with time. You should make a good consider.",A2
"I agree. Not only is passive smoking annoying it is dangerous to the non-smoker as well. It is enough that smokers blow smoke all over Tokyo except in a few prohibited places without having to sit in restaurants that smell like chimneys and throughout the meal, be concerned if it was safe to eat while smokers were puffing away on their fags. The thing is that passive smokers die from the same diseases that smokers do and it is time to put a stop to it. I do concede that everyone can choose to go to smoking and non-smoking restaurants (if there any around) or not to go anywhere. On that basis we all make our decisions. However the poisons from smoking can float through the air and not only be inhaled by non-smokers but they can also be on the skin and more important the food. Now over a period of time this might be OK and then suddenly, someone gets sick and eventually dies. But it is not necessary to take the risk and we now know that chemicals from fags and food do not mix well together, so it is best to keep the fags away from the food altogether.",C2
"In my opinion, I'm strongly agree that the part-time job is important for college students. First, college students have more free time than other students, such as senior high school students and junior high school students. I think that we should make good use of time when we are free or weekends. Second, I don't plan to continue studying after I graduate. I want to work after I graduate so I should search some part-time job to promote my social experience and learn more things that we can't learn from school. Besides, I made a lot of friends from kinds of regions in my part-time job period and became more bravery and mature. I usually enjoy my job. By part-time job enhancing my relationship. Finally, I'm responsible for my tuition fee and entertainment fee. I' think we are able to make a few money by ourselves. Do part-time job can also release parents' pressure of economy. In summer vacation, more college students search part-time job. However, we have to watch out some illegal company. Be careful ourselves when we search part-time job. Most importantly, don't casually give your personal information to people that we just meet him. Though, part-time job can't make a lot of money, I get more something good from work. I always hold positive attitude to my every part-time job and enjoying it very much. So I agree this topic completely.",B1.1
"Students are increasingly likely to work while in college. Though there are some negative aspects like over-exertion and some sort of tensions, these jobs help the students with their financial needs and at the same time, it provides the much-needed experience while studying or the so-called On The Job Training (OJT). With the rising cost of tuition, supplies and some expenses, earning money while in college can be a priority for many students. Aside from paying for schooling itself, it is important for people particularly, college students to have their spending money for activities and entertainment so that one can stay sane when the pressures of education become heavy. Holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having a part time job while studying will also help you prepare what field of work or profession you will get into. It will also give you experiences that will be very useful for your future work or profession. Your experiences from your part time job will help you enhance and develop more of your skills you have.",B1.2
"Part time mean for only part of the working hours. In Pakistan the main purpose doing part time jobs is to maintain the economic conditions of that person. But the development countries such as USA and European countries people also doing part time job to elaborates their natural abilities present in them. They play the important role in country development. There are some advantages of part time job. In Pakistan part time job is a necessity of every educated person. Due to many problems such as less sources for doing work, and low salary or no pay or less pay for employment. Allah has given the most important part of the body that is mind which is helped ourself to doing good or bad etc. If a educated person spend more in working place then his absent good abilities or good qualities will be displayed in front of other persons. by expending, the mental level of that person, the new good feelings, sentiments could be lead them to continue the doing work to have extra money. So the part time job is a benefit and blessing of Allah as this is the helpful source to earn extra money in respected way. It is the honourable method to get more income.",B1.2
"I strongly believe that smoking should be banned from restaurants because it is really unhealthy for peopleto inhale smoke which is very hazardous for their health; However, if smoking is totally banned from restaurants, I believe that there will be a human rights violation so I would suggest that there should be a designated area for smoking. Most of the Filipinos are not aware of the smoking ban especially those in rural areas unlike in other countries, it is highly implemented and imposed penalty for the violators. I had interviewed some Overseas Filipino Worker s regarding smoking and most of their answerswere YES and it is strictly implemented but there's also some who violate the rules but penalty is highly implemented like in Singapore and United Kingdom as far as I know, smoking in non-designated areas is stirctly prohibited so why can't we also implemeent it and for our good health as well. Our senators have passed a bill on smoking and it was implemented but not applied throughout the country so I would like to suggest that there should be a designated smmoking area for smoking outside the restaurants and this bill should likewise be implemented effective immediately and there should be dessmination campaign for the good of the people and the country as well.",B1.2
"In my personal point of view, only study is not good for student. It is like you do not open your worldview. Doing other activities provide more benefits for college students. I think that college students can do a part time job during their studying because it is a great opportunity to gain new experience in their life. And the students can apply this experience to the future work. Moreover, they can get some money from doing a part time job. If someone works hard, they may get a lot of money to support their life. In addition, it is a better way of college students to practice the skills they study outside class such as communication skill when they have to communicate with their colleague and their boss at work place. They can face new people, new friends and new world not only the world in their university. One important thing is that a part time job can improve self -discipline. The students have to manage their time properly if they want to do a part time job. So, it will not affect their studying. When we feel tired from work, we do not want to do anything more. You can imagine that if students have a test or homework, people who have good responsibility will deal with this task appropriately. All of this is just positive advantages of doing a part time job of college students.",B1.1
"Part time jobs are not mandatory for others. It is a choice. A choice made by people who needed extra money. As we all know, people of today are in need of sufficient money so that they would survive in daily living, esp. the hapless. These people tend to do extra work because they don't have a choice. They tend to double their work to survive. These people have different reasons to get intouch of having another jobs. Mostly, people apply part time jobs for their family. Some are people who sustain their own needs and leisures. Some are students who doesn't have enough money to support their education, esp. college students. Even though they have their main purposes, they will still find time to do part times because it is mandatory for them. Part time jobs have low salaries, but as I said, these people doesn't have a choice but to do extra work so they will still apply for it. Engaging this kind of job also has advatages. You're not just earning extra money, you will also gain experience in terms of working. You will also be responsible in terms of things you need to finish and you will also lear how to manage and balance your time in all of your works. Thus, having a part time job really helps.",B1.2
"I agree with this idea. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons why I think so. First, there are the facts that smoking is bad for our health and that side-stream smoke is more harmful than mainstream smoke. These facts mean that smoking is the problem not only for smokers themselves, but also for non-smokers. More specifically, non-smokers heavily suffer from smoking than smokers. Even if they try not to smoke, non-smokers suffer from harmful side-stream smoke, as long as they are near smoking people. Secondly, we have to think about what kind of place restaurants are, especially about the users. Many various people use restaurants, including little children, the old, the weak, and people who hate smoking. For such people, smoking is unbearable. As the result of the above, protecting non-smokers from side-stream smoke is the most important thing, and smokers should always care that there're many people who suffer from their smoking. My idea might sound strict with smokers. But as I know that there're some smokers who do want to smoke, I don't force them to stop smoking, because it's their own responsibilities to decide whether they smoke or not considering their health. If they do want to smoke, they have to choose a proper place to smoke. For example, they can go to a bar where they are allowed to smoke freely without being complained. In brief, we should completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country and smokers should always care about other people. But some places where we are allowed to smoke should be left for smokers. I believethat this is the best way how smokers and non-smokers can live together.",B1.1
"Indonesia economy status is irregular and sometimes located in difficult moments, so each of us requires creativity to find a slot to survive, including students. There are some students who have problems with registration, try to relieve the burden on parents to work. But there are also students working on the basis of independence, or simply in search of money extra life needs are increasing. Part-time job, which is the student who has a job as the main task of the University. For example: private education, SPG/SPB (promotion of sales girl / boy sales promotion), event MC, broadcast radio, Internet-based business can be done in the growing college cost. The benefits that we can get on a part-time job basis are may we have own income and ability in financial management. Also some new experience that we have very useful when working to support the Conference itself. At least you can feel directly all questions related to the real world of work. basically, the content of conferences is the explain terms and things that happened and is closely related to the world of work, e. g. the ability to organize working groups. Also the students can use the company for which work as an object of studies of case, discussion papers or Conference allocations. Students can use the facilities of the company, such as computers or the Internet service, for the benefit of conferences and, of course, this is done outside of working hours. Last, we can better able to manage time between school and work. Bringing the benefits are also the consequences, that's for sure. The point is the willingness, preparedness and management time that must be really organized. So the balance between lectures with the work that still must be maintained.",B1.2
"I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job will distract students from their studies and college is an important period where students focus on their studies so that they would be able to get a better certificate and secure a good job in the future. A part-time job will be mentally and physically draining for students and they might not be able to cope with the stress from both school and the part-time job. Academics at college can be rather demanding and taking up a part-time job will be too time-consuming for students. A job might be a distractor for students and caused them to be overly engaged and distracted. Even though it is true that a part-time job will help to train students to become more independent individuals and allow them to gain real working experience, students will have to weigh the pros and cons carefully before getting a job. They will have to consider the academic demands of their courses as well as the requirements of the job before making a decision. It depends on the individuals if they are able to cope with overwhelming stress and anxiety from school and work but it is definitely not important for college students to have a part-time job.

" To have a part-time job has been popular to college students now. Some students have the view that they can earn some money by themselves which can decrease the burden of their parents, and they can gain some experience to work so that they can do the other work better in the future. But another part of students don't agree with them. Because they think they are still students now and the most important thing for them is to learn more knowledge and try to get a great mark. It will cost a lot of time to do part-time jobs and they can only get a little money. College students should put their hearts into their majors, but not part-time jobs. In my opinion, college students have two school, one is what they are study in and the other is society. They should learn knowledge not only in the university, but also in society. So I recommend college students can do some part-time jobs if they have enough time. Society is the best school to us all and we must know how to adapt to society well. For college students, doing some part-time jobs is the best way so that they can develop in all-round way.",B1.2
"Just as an old saying goes, one coin has two sides, part-time job can bring us some convenient, money, expand our social experience, but can also waste our time, scatter our concentration, and may eventually influence our grades in the university. For me, I think the bad influence of part-time job overweighs more than the advantages, and it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. Part-time job wastes our academic and free time. University is a place to study the latest knowledge, try to get involved in many fields, such as some other course besides our own major. However, part-time job would take up most of the time; and if we cannot use the time in our university more efficiently, we would lose the time to improve ourselves both physically and emotionally. There are some other ways to make money and fulfill our social experience, except for part-time job. For the students in great need of money to get through the university, part-time job isn't the only method. We can ask for some fund and scholars from our school, also we can be a TA. So we can use some academic ways to make money. Besides, internship is a better way to get social experience. Also, part-time job would scatter our focus on the campus life. For example, if we get a part-time job as a tutor for high school students, we must have to prepare the classes, get to the classroom or the students' house. And all the things will bother us and break the peaceful campus life. To sum up, part-time job isn't important and necessary for college students. What we have done in our university will decide the way of our whole life, and obviously we should make better use of the period.",B2
"I perfectly agree this topic to respect all people who are in restaurants. I have been suffered this bad problem from smoking when I eat out with my family at restaurants. Everywhere I go, there were many people who make me angry. It can be expanded the meaning scale of place in which it is called public place. Now, public places are created around us. I went to the park near my boarding house when I have a time to play badminton with friends for health. At there, I played just about few minutes because a person smokes close to us. That stimulates my nose and can't play more. Also, I played basketball after the school in next to the play ground. At there, my friend smokes. In a sudden near me a person who talks with another said Please, stop smoking while resting. In this reason my friend said I'm really sorry that I will stop it right away. Like this instances, just one or two, so many non-smokers can be pain with breathing when they go there. Just think about it what you cause. Smokers should know if they are no smoking but who smokes in the public place besides you or your family. If so, you must be anger that because of the bad smell.

"Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants in the country?To me, the answer will be ""Yes"". All of us know that smoking is not good for our health. There are too many drawbacks for smoking. Once you smoke, you might not get rid of this bad habbit. Through smoking more and more, the risk of suffering from cancer is getting larger and larger. Some researchs tell us that smoking is one of the reasons of dead. For pregnants, smoking can not only affect their own body but also damage their babys. Beside damage smokers' own health, the most suffering are those who are near them. Think of this situation, one day you go to a restaurant and have a delicious meal. Everything seems wonderful for you. However, people who beside your site is smoking. How does the meal taste?The smells of cigarette is awful to many people. So I strongly agree that restaurant must be smoke-free. The authority of concerned should do the best to ban smoking at the restaurants. By the way, I think that maybe there could be some specific regions in the restaurants or other sides where people can smoke. For smokers, it is also their duty that they should try their best to quit smoking. After all, it is not a good behavior to have a cigarette and affect other people's health.",B1.1
"It is not important for college student to have a part-time job as it may not offer what is required for the students. Whether a not college students need the job is dependent on their financial needs and also their priorities. College life may have long breaks in between the semesters which serve as a very timely period for doing a part-time job which can finance the students' expenses or luxurious spending such as getting a new smart phone or accessories. Students who have other priorities such as getting good grades or having a better portfolio would rather spend time doing an internship in a company or to prepare for the upcoming modules they have to take. For students who are financially burdened, a part-time job is important for them to fulfil their daily needs. However, for those who are not, it can merely serve as a mean to fill their excess time and it also comes with monetary reward. Some may argue that working part-time can help a college student manage their time more effectively, especially if the part-time job is done regularly during semester period as there will be lesser time spare for the student to do their academic work. However, having a co-curricular activity or taking up a leadership position in various groups can better enhance the students' college life. Therefore, I believe that the importance of having a part-time job for students in college is not necessary unless by circumstances or by the needs that the students have to satisfy. ",B2
"I think the university during the period. We should try to work time. But. Achievement is very important. So. We should be appropriate to do part-time jobs. Should be based on academic oriented.

But not the most important then study. If will not affect my academic performance. I think I will try to do part-time job. It is good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. After-school work enhances a young person's social development. After-school work teaches students how hard it is to earn money and helps develop thriftiness in our younger generation. Because they earn money, students can pay for their education and thus will value their education even more. And, in return, their experience will make them know better what they have learned in classes and books. Part-time work allows us to learn many things. But do not spend too much time on part-time work. I believe. When we graduated from university. Part-time work is clearly very small salary. But we learned some life experience before.

"Smoking is an ill habit. Now a days, it is very common among young generation although its roots and spread everywhere in the world. Smoking is injurious to health. Smoking is adopted by the people to sooth themselves and relax themselves but they are either unaware of it's after effects or want to get rid of this life. Smokers actually don't care to face the reality of life and run away like cowards. Young generation is more include in this evil activity due to its temptation. Smoking cause headache, nausea etc. but the biggest and the foremost problem caused by smoking is destruction of lungs years after years. Smokers become lazy and vague. Sold bread earns become fatigued and unable to run their families. Students are reduced of failure. The above discussion clearly implies that smoking is injurious in all respects to people. But smoking in public places should be restricted especially to avoid or prevent teen ages to get the temptation of smoking. Any smokers could give firstly free of cost (cigarette) to anyone for any purpose. Secondly, the smoker produced or released by cigarette contains concingocnic materials and very harmful gases which may damage the lunges of the person sitting by him. The smoke may enter through nose and then lungs. Restaurant are the place where public come to enjoy or relax to come out of their routine and if anyone is smoking in such a place the outsiders will get a bad site children could be attracted by it and the smoke limited by cigarette could cause long lasting effect on the health of their people.

"Smoking â€“ it is one of those that are called recreational drugs. Yet for some reason, they are generally accepted in the society. We've heard those adverse effects that smoking brings about. We've heard them over and over in every health-promoting program. But putting that aside, don't you think smoking is just being plain inconsiderate of other people? Apart from being utterly dangerous and life-threatening to both first-hand and second-hand smokers, it simply is a violation of the social ettiquette. This especially applies to public places like restaurants. Just imagine how crazily annoying it would be to have smokers ruin your appetite just when your food arrives. The smoke will surely mess with the appetizing aroma of your food. Eventually, your whole food experience will seem unfulfilling and just plain terrible. That is why banning smoking in such places would be fitting for our society. Restaurants are closed areas; therefore, smoking inside such areas would cause a lot of discomfort for everyone in the restaurant. iClearly, it is not only those who are trying to enjoy a fulfilling meal that are affected. Even those just chilling in the area are also being bombarded with unfavorable smell and smoke. In short, smoking in restaurants and other public places is exposing random people to your harm. Still, it is not only the customers who experience this dilemma with smoking. By smoking in such places, one also threatens the restaurant since it would definitely discourage customers. Smoking ruins the ambiance that the restuarant efforts to keep for their customers to enjoy. Therefore, implementing a law regarding this would be best. Smoking should definitely be banned in restaurants and the like. Needless to say, smoking is harmful and really, really, really annoying.",B2
"Smoking is a personal habit, which must not violate the others' rights for clean air. Especially in restaurants people want to enjoy their meals in relaxed atmosphere and spend good time. While non-smoking customers are having their meals, the smoking customers should think of others' right to enjoy their time and meals as more important ones than smokers' rights in this case. Because only when one does not violate the others own rights, he can claim his own right. In many coffee shops in Korea, there are many special cells for smoking people, which have tables and chairs. The coffee shops want to protect non-smokers' rights to be separated from the smokers and also satisfy smoking customers at the same time. However, whenever the smoking customers enter and leave the cells, the smoke comes out of the cells and the people outside of the cells can smell the foul scent. It still limit non-smokers' rights for clean air. So I hope the restaurant not to choose the same policy as the coffee shops now have. I want the restaurant have strict policy about smoking in their restaurants in order to protect non-smokers' rights.",B2
"I think that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in Japan. As I said before, I am very conscientious about my health and my fitness, and smoking has absolutely no place in my life because of its power to destroy the body. Another thing that many people don't know about is the ability of smoking to destroy the mind. Smokers can become very nervous and fidgety if they do not have their nicotine, and I think this makes them weaker as people. If the only time they can be very cool and collected is when they are smoking a cigarette, they have an enormous disadvantage as compared to people like me who consistently work to become naturally more focused and energetic. Japan has always struck me as a country where the people are very Zen, and so I would think that they're not particularly keen on tobacco use. But at the end of the day I don't really know. Therefore, if the Japanese people would like to be like me and would like to become more conscientious and better to their health, they should ban smoking at the restaurants in order to achieve this goal. If they can do that, they will take a step towards being more healthy as a country.",C2
"Drugs addiction is very dangerous habit. It is enough to destroy a nation. In Pakistan this disease has been growing dangerously. It is very alarming situation.

Restaurant is for everyone for families, friends and relatives not only for smokers. When everyone is eating, feasting, and enjoying. The smokers make the environment very unpleasant. A smokers is enemy of his own life and by doing smoking he destroy the lives of other people also. Smoking affects the smoker's lungs and breathing. Mostly intensive smoking result death of the smokers. But smoking is dangerous not only for smokers but also for other. The smoke of smoking is very dangerous for others. When a smokers smoke of smoking, the smoke of smoking is inhaled by others. This inhaled smoke gets into lungs and creates disturbance in the inhaling process. It causes different disease like asthma, black cough, cancer and other diseases. All these diseases in their acute from ends at death of the smoking usually full in the disease of cancer. That's why the other people who don't smoke are much affected than the smokers. So it's necessary to ban the smoking in restaurant. In the restaurant the great strength is of women. And the smoke of smoking is most dangerous for women. It affects women's reproductive system badly. In Weston countries the disease of women reproductive system is very much common due to smoking and also due to inhalation of smoke.

"I don't agree at all. I think that it should be left up to the owner's discretion. If we allow governments to legislate everything, supposedly in the publics' best interests, then where is it going to end? Next thing you know, they will start legislating how many tissues can be passed out at the train stations. If we give them too much power, then they will start to monitor everything that we do. I don't believe that it is the government's job and if commercial establishments a. k. a. restaurants, want to regulate their own establishments, then that's fine. I seriously believe that many governments are interfering far too much in ordinary folk's daily lives as it is. I feel that it would be far better just to have smoking and non-smoking restaurants and let customers decide for themselves where they want to eat. After all, that's called democracy and Japan has a democratic government don't they? I don't think that it is a good idea for the Japanese government to outright ban smoking in restaurants because I believe that it goes against the very principles of democracy. The people elect the government anyway, so why not put it to the people and let them and the restaurants decide? That would be the democratic thing to do in my view and I am certain that most people would have a lot more respect for the government rather than being told to do this and do that all the time.",C2
"Excellent idea! How soon can it be set up? Honestly, I'm surprised that it has taken this long for Japan to consider this ban. Smoking related deaths and sicknesses in Japan are increasing, not decreasing and the number of illnesses that can be attributed to passive smoking, are also on the rise. While I guess that there might be a huge backlash at first, people would adopt the idea soon enough and a ban can only help the health situation in the long run. Too bad if the smokers disagree because really, no one is telling them not to smoke, just where they are not allowed to smoke which seems perfectly OK to me. Why should others be inconvenienced or be put at risk if they don't want to suck in secondhand smoke? If people are working near inflammable substances and there are smoking restrictions in place, nobody seems to mind and everybody understands readily enough. For me, it just makes perfect sense to do the same thing in restaurants and public places because chemicals from smokes can kill and cause disease which makes it high risk just to go to a restaurant and eat out. Let's make the world a safer place to live in and start by cleaning up the air that we breathe.",C2
"Recently, there are more and more people smoking in Hong Kong, though smoking has been proved as an unhealthy habit. As a result, whether to ban smoking at all restaurants has become a controversial issue. In my opinion, although whether to smoke is one's right, non-smokers who are sitting in the same restaurant should by no means be forced to inhale any of the smoke. Smoking should immediately be banned at all restaurants in our city. As we all know, smoking leads to severe illness like lung cancer and heart disease. And, when one smokes, the air around must inevitably be contaminated with all these harmful smoke. Therefore, the customers nearby have to smoke with the smokers. Let's imagine, if we take 3 meals everyday at restaurants and spend 30 minutes for each, how much smoke will we breathe in and how will our health be affected? The only result is our health deteriorates. What is more, the deterioration of our health will lead to heavy workload to the public hospitals, and lead to a higher death rate. Therefore, the public's health should under no circumstances be sacrificed for the selfish behavior of the smokers. That is, smoking must be completely banned at all restaurants.",B1.2
"Part time job is one way of earning money or to make extra income. Everyone wants to have a part time job so that they will have a source of income when they need or they have something to buy. It is also a way of socializing with other people, for example through internet- the networking job-it is not only a job to have extra income but also at the same time you will become popular with other people. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. As a student, I will say that it is important to have a part time job because at a young age I can help my mom in terms of financial and I will have a source of income on my own, if there is something I want to buy I can easily buy it. It will also help me buy things in school- for projects, assignment, tuition fees-. For me, it is also a way of socializing with other people, I will meet different people and will become my friends. And last it is important because it will train or practice me to become confident, comfortable and well prepare for the future.",B1.1
"I think smoking shouldn't be banned at all restaurants because different customs have different requirement. We all know smoking is bad for people themselves and can affect their neighbors' health though the second-hand smoke, so most restaurants should ban smoking to protect customs' health. This also makes our city clean and healthy. But should all restaurants do so? I don't think so because it's too strict and doesn't respect all people's right. Some customs they just want to go to somewhere that can smoke and we assume people who go to these restaurants accept smoking. Many people have a habit of smoking and they need cigarettes to make them calm especially for business man when they talk about some business on dinner. We know that many successful businessmen like smoking and smoking make them handle things better. Many people just enjoy smoking and their friends may also like it. The best way for them to have entertainment may be having a lunch with cigarettes and a restaurant that allows smoking is their best choice. It's better for them to smoke in a restaurant rather than in other public environment. Limit smoking in a small space is better than making it spread out.",B1.1
"I fully agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. The negative consequences of smoking are now so pronounced in the entire country that almost everyone knows about them. Yet, inconsiderate people are still smoking and increasing the risk of mortality rate of themselves and to those around them. Studies have shown that cigarette smoke contain carcinogens --- substances which can lead to cancer. In restaurants, these carcinogens could attach themselves on the surrounding food, thereby further increasing the risk of cancer to those who are consuming them Besides that, in enclosed restaurants, cigarette smoke can cause the entire environment to be polluted with the putrid smell of it. This would also adversely affect the other non-smoking patrons' enjoyment of their food. Lastly, restaurants usually cater to people of different age groups. Young children and babies have increased risk of developing acute or chronic conditions from breathing in too much cigarette smoke as their immune system might not be fully developed yet. Furthermore, pregnant women are also at risk because the cigarette smoke could affect the foetus in the womb. With all the negative externalities brought about by smoking, smoking should definitely be banned at all restaurants in the country. In fact, I would further advocate for smoking to be banned at all places in the country, except for several smoking points where smoking is allowed. There are many high-risk activities such as mountain climbing which have a greater mortality rate than smoking. However, smoking increases the mortality rate of others and not just the user or doer. As a result, it is unfair to the innocent non-smoking bystanders, and smoking should be banned. ",B1.2
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons. First, college students can learn a lot of things which they don't study at collage through working. For example, relationship, skill and manner. I have a part-time job in Japanese restaurant. The work is very hard, and I often receive advises by colleague and the chief. Sometimes I am scolded so badly. I want to quit the work when the chief scold me. But they help me when I'm in trouble. In fact, I really thank them because they tell me the important things for society. And I become to have responsibility for my job. I really realize that I grew up mentality through working. It is good for me. Secondly, collage students can communicate with many people who they can't speak in daily life. In Japanese restaurant where I work, there are many housewives. I sometimes feel generation gap, but talking with them is very fun. We talk about rising children and money. They speak what I don't know. It is very interesting for me. I think having a part-time job give a lot of important things for society to college students.",B1.1
"Despite of the fact that smoking does harm to health, as is known by almost everyone, there are still many people keep smoking everyday. They often light a cigratte at any place they like, especially in public situation, such as restaurants and so on. I feel really uncomfortable while a person is smoking close to me. Accordingly, I suggest that smoking should be mainly banned at all restaurants in the country. The reasons are as follows. First of all, as is mentioned above, smoking is really harmful to smokers' health and people around them as well. A number of research reports indicate that a heavy smoking is likely to lead to a lung cancer which is a deadly disease for human beings. Banning them smoking at restaurants is an effective way to control their smoking more or less. What's more, if there is no one smoking at restaurants, other customers can enjoy a meal with pleasure in a comfortable environment. In this way, customers may feel relaxed and have a good appetite, which will stimulate the income of restaurants. Neverthless, if some smokers can't bear this rule, we can set up a smoking room for them to smoke. This room must be sealed in case other customers will be troubled by it. These are my general ideas of banning smoking at all restaurants in the country. I can draw a safe conclusion that this decision will bring us more good than harm, so we can appeal to our friends to support it.",B2
"I think it is a good idea that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants because we all know that cigarettes can cause us a liver disease, bad breath and can weaken our ability to think. A cigarette not only affects the users but also the people near with it. It's because of the smoke coming from the cigarette that is exhaled by the smoker and combines through the air and inhaled by the person nearby. The person will gain the Second hand smoke even though it is called the second its effects is greater than the smoker. It is really important to have a no smoking policies to all the restaurants so that the cleanliness in the surrounding and even in the air remains. It also maintains the good comments of the people to the restaurants because smoking in an area makes the place like it is not a formal place. The restaurants have their own rules and one of the most important rule is to serve well the customers and to know the sayings that the customers is always right. This means that in every restaurant they need to become ready in every customer they will have. For example if their customer is a smoker they have to talk with him/her in a good manner to asked permission that they don't allowed cigarettes in their restaurant, or bring him/her in a place where there are no customers that can be affected so that there will be no problem that can be occurred.",B1.2
"Restaurants in Hong Kong have been divided into two zones---non-smoking area and smoking area for the sake of public's health. However, only if smoking is completely banned at all restaurants, can the aim be achieved. Nowadays the air quality in restaurants is not as clean as we think. Smoking always produces harmful particles, like sulphur, nicotine, tar, etc. Nonetheless, they are invisible to human. The harmful particles produced are trapped in restaurants and flow from smoking area to non-smoking area. The air we breathe in is actually contains many impurities. Prolong staying in a restaurant which has a smoking area do harm to people, especially the workers here. Moreover, there are many people go to restaurants, ranging from infants to elderly. The harmful particles can easily damage their health. Some people may argue that completely banning of smoking in restaurants demolish smokers' human right. In a society, we should make a comprehensive consideration before making any decisions---balance between individuals' interests and the whole society's. All decisions we made should base on most citizens' interests. Banning of smoking is proposed to be applied in restaurants only. The government or some social communities have set up some smoking zones for smokers which show their care to smokers. If you were a smoke, would you smoke in a living room and let your family take in second-hand smoke? To most parents, they would like to go to toilet and take cigarette alone. It is the same situation. Please be more considerate. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants for the healthy development of the society.",B1.2
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think so. In my opinion, college students are apart from the society. However part-time jobs make them understand the society. We all know in the society, competition more and more fierce. Many college students can't find jobs. So their pressures are very heavy. Therefore, many reasons press college students into finding a part-time job. I think a part-time job have an advantage to college students. In the first, college students are called unusually lucky person and live in the tower of ivory. Their lives are separated from the society. I think if they haven't a part-time job, thus, they haven't society experience and don't adapt to the cruel society right away. Now, I'm a student study in Wuhan University. Though I'm a student at two grades, I'm a home teacher in Hanyang. My student is a girl in a high school. I like the student; she is very lovely and hard in study. I hope she will have a big progress in study. I need to make a lot of preparations to teach her well. So I learn a lot when I do this part-time job. In my opinion, a part-time job is very important to college students.",B1.1
"Nowadays, Smoking is the problem that every countries could not stop it. Thailand also could not stop it. On the other hand, it is serious problem now. I agree with the topic that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reason that why smoking should be banned. The first reason is unhealthy. Surely, smoking is the bad thing for heath. You could see from there are many problems from smoking like sickliness. This is the main problem of Thai people who smoke. Because Thailand is the number one about people died from smoking. The second reason is money. Nowadays, the price of cigarette is expensive more than in the past. Therefore it not good for the person who have low income. And Thailand is the country, where is developing country. So we should stop it right now. The third reason is happy. If the person who often have smoking, they will not happy. Because the person who live near him will complain him. For the smoker who stay with many people like family. You should stop smoking, if you love them. Because if you still smoking, you and them will near death as soon as. Therefore, the smoking should be completely banned in Thailand.",B1.1
"Agree, because there will be additional revenue. And leisure interests as well as the three-car experience to use in the future. We plan on time. With an adult. To what would have to buy it.

About saving money because it will come a time very tired, rather than acquisition. And also the knowledge and ability to meet new people and make things very broad upward. Better use of leisure time to travel. To play games that are not beneficial to the society and we have more unemployment and social problems, I am a part time job that is necessary for students to even make the time to learn. Less leisure, but we need to plan. The time is not so bad about learning to know their time is just this happy with a part time job.

"In my opinion, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants. Firstly, there is no need to argue that smoking is extremely bad for health, which is the main cause for lung cancer and other diseases. The passive smoking is even more harmful and if someone smoke in the restaurant, all the customers will suffer from it. Moreover, if smoking is banned, the restaurant will be under lower risk of fire, especially in the private chartered dining rooms. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurant is a policy which will help in the restaurant management. Without smoke and snipes, the hygiene standard of the restaurant will be improved. Also there will be no more complains about passive smoking from the customers. Lastly, according to research result, smoking while having meals will affect your appetite. In order to enjoy the delicious food in the restaurant, it is better to completely ban smoking. Many smokers feel unfair that the police is not people oriented for them. They argue that they will feel extremely uncomfortable if they cannot find places to smoke sometimes, which I think is quite reasonable. Maybe other than banning smoking completely, common smoking rooms should be set in the restaurants to solve this problem.",B2
"Everyone know that smoking is bad for their health. So why is someone still smokes? Well, probably because they think that smoking is smart or it can make them relax. In case of restaurant, Does smoking must be banned ? It's extremely sure! The restaurant is a place that many people come to have a breakfast, a lunch or a dinner. They can be cute baby, smart boy, beautiful woman or old grandfather. Surely that they don't want to be harm from smoking. Everyone don't want to be close to a person who is smoking, because it has a bad smell and it is bad for their health. But, how can we do if they really want to smoke? Well, you can build a private room that used for smoking. You can decorate the room with anything that will be beautiful. This room must be far away from people that come to have a meal and it must be far away from the toilet too. May be this is the best way for them. Smoking doesn't give you any benefit. It doesn't give you only a bad health, but it will waste your money too. So, you must not smoke!",B1.1
"I don't think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, in Japan, 26. 8 percent (man: 41. 3 percent, woman: 12. 4 percent) people are smoking. In economical side, if these people do not enter restaurants, restaurants would have a big loss Some people say that if they do not ban smoking in restaurants, non smokers wouldn't enter restaurants. But restaurants have already restricted smoking. They set up seats for smokers. All restaurants do not set up it, but almost major restaurants set up it. In addition, they set time, when people can smoke or not. For example, in lunch time (11:00~14:00) all seats (include smoking seats) are banned smoking. Restaurants concerned guests. Thus, restaurant's attitude is not to ban smoking. As long as someone legislates that smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, restaurants will not ban smoking in restaurants. Restaurants choose profits. Restaurants provide a lot of comfy equipments for smokers and non smokers. I think just a few cheap judgment non smoking people yell ""smoking is too bad! So smoking and smokers should be exterminated!!"" So I think they can't completely ban smoking in restaurants in Japan in economical viewpoint and they don't have to ban smoking by force. Because there are demands.",B1.1
"I agree with having a part-time job. Because working is precious experience and the thing that we should have responsibility for. So we can get much useful time in it. But I disagree with having it only for getting money. Because we should study in free time. So we should work to study. For example, if one wants to be a teacher, he should work at a juku to learn to teach children useful knowledge. And if one wants to be a sports trainer, he should work at gym to study useful knowledge about sports, health, and so on and to learn communicate with many people. In the other words, it is important for us to work at the place where there is the thing that we are interested in. So it is stupid thing to have a part-time job only for getting money. And when we work only for money, we waste so much time. We should have it in our minds that we have limited time. It has only four years. But if we use it usefully, four years is long, long time. So I agree with having a part-time job only if we have it for studying many precious things.",A2
"I absolutely agree with a prohibition of smoking in all the restaurants. It's the fact that has been already proved smoking affects all the people around smokers. Even though the fact is it, Korea doesn't have suitable law. I watched a programmer about smoking in public area. Once, a baby who was passing under the balcony was damaged his eyes by ash. It means smoking in public area is very dangerous and harmful for anyone around them. It's obvious smoking cause cancer people who don't smoke, near the smokers. When I was in Ireland for 8 months, I saw many Irish smoking. But it was outside. Even in the pubs, they didn't smoke because it was a law. I was so impressed that feel need to have a law in Korea as well. It's not forcing smokers to stop smoking. They need to avoid smoking in public area. We can make some area or place outside the restaurants for smokers. I think it should be banned not just in all the restaurants, in all the public area because the opinion you mentioned does not completely force them to stop it. So, the opinion I mentioned is not so strong law when we consider the danger of its harm.",B1.2
"Part time job is a job done for few hours, in the industrial societies the job hours are divided in two categories. One is full time job and the other is part time job. Full time job mean eight continuous hours while the part time job varies from four to six hours depending on the nature of the job. In such societies people are paid on the basis of their working hours. For example eight or ten dollars per hour were paid to the workers in USA in 90s. Now the part time job has made his place in eastern or back ward countries like Pakistan. The most popular example of part time job in our country is the job of call centers. At call centers the people work round the clock in different shifts and without caring for day and night. Mostly students are doing these kind of jobs to increase their pocket money and increase their experience of practical life. Although this is a healthy trend to increase the money and income and a good way to keep the mind and body busy and working in a positive way even yet it is having some bad effects as well. So all time running after money is not a healthy thing.",B1.2
"Life nowadays is like hunger games â€“ no pain, no gain. Everyone needs to work in order to survive. though some of the teenagers are still depending on their parents, time will come that they need to work, they really need. No matter how rich or poor they are, having a job is essential for averybody especially now that money makes the world go round. Almost every college student's goals are to graduate and to have the job that he deserves. But this does not apply to all. Some college students are doing dove-tailingâ€”students in morning and workers in evening or vice versa. They are doing this to have an extra allowance, to help their family financially and to gain an early experience for their future career. As we consider their everyday life, it is difficult and very stressful but as we look at their reasons for doing this, we may consider them as heroes. I believe that these students/workers are risk-takers. Many things may be sacrificed because of this kind of living. One of those is their social life. Instead of having fun every Friday night, they are in a busy placeâ€”working. Also, their family bonding may be lessen. Instead of playing with their siblings or helping their parents in household chores, they are in a busy placeâ€”working. At the end of the day, if we think positively, having a part-time job will be an advantage for college students when they are going to apply for their future career.",B1.2
"Smoking is an expensive habit and it should be banned. Although smokers claim that it helps them to relax and release stress, the negative aspects of the habit outweigh the positive. It is a health hazard for both smokers and non-smokers and it is especially harmful to unborn babies. Cigarettes are also addictive because of the nicotine they contain. Cigarette smoking causes a number of health problems which are expensive to treat. It is a major cause of respiratory diseases such as asthma, lung cancer and bronchitis. It also leads to heart disease. In spite of the money which the Government receives from taxing cigarettes, the cost of medical treatment for these diseases exceeds this income. As a consequence, non smoking taxpayers are forced to pay for the health costs of smokers. This is a very unfair situation. Another reason for banning smoking is that cigarette smoke affects the health of non-smokers and unborn babies. Non-smokers soften suffer from eye and nose irritations, allergies and headaches as a result of inhaling second-hand smoke. There is also evidence to suggest that passive smoking may cause lung cancer. Smoking during pregnancy can hinder to growth of the foetus and may even result in death. Finally, the nicotine which is found in cigarettes is highly addictive. Other addictive substances such as cocaine and heroin are illegal. The fact that tobacco remains legal is an anomaly.",B1.2
"I disagree that it is important for college students in Singapore to have a part-time job. This is because the education system in Singapore is extremely competitive and college years are the crucial period in deciding if one makes the grade to enter local universities. Part-time jobs are temporary and for a college student, they are mostly allowed to work low-level, labour-intensive jobs. This would sap up the time and energy of students and infringe upon their revision time. This is aside from the CCA activities demanded outside of curriculum time. Thus, there is a high possibility that grades would be negatively impacted taking up a part-time job, unless the student is exceptionally well at time-management. It may be argued that the job experience, albeit part-time, is worthwhile as college students get ""a feel of the outside working world"". However I feel that one can always get exposed to the working world after graduation from college. Thus, picking up working skills is not as important as studying hard to secure a degree during college years. College years are the defining moment of how one's education journey unfolds, not the linchpin of one's career path. According to society, the latter usually comes later. As such, I do not think it is important to get a part-time job for students in the Singapore society because students should focus on their studies and a part-time job would only serve more distraction than benefits. With unwise time management, it may even adversely impact one's chances of getting into the local universities and it would be a shame for the student as another year may be spent to repeat college or start all over again studying at a polytechnic.

"I agree with this statement. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have mainly two reasons and, then, I will mention why I agree. First, a lot of people who do not smoke often hate a smoke of cigarettes. At the restaurants, they have the rights of enjoying eating, and if someone is smoking near them they can not enjoy it. Since the restaurants are public place, it should be kept comfortable for everyone. Smoking sometimes makes people uncomfortable, so smoking should be banned at the public place like the restaurants. Second, a smoke of cigarettes affects not only the feelings of people who do not like smoking but also the health of everyone. If you smoke, of course it is bad for your health. In addition, it is worse for the health of people who sitting near you or serving the dishes to you. It is proved scientifically that people not who smoking but who is near smoking man are more affected in the point of the health. So smoking should be banned in order to protect the customers and the employees of that restaurant from harm of the cigarette's smoke. That is my ideas about smoking. Of course it is better that they can stop smoking by themselves at the restaurants but it is difficult, I think. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The restaurants should be comfortable place for everyone.",B1.1
"As far as I am concerned, it is important for student to have a part-time job. My points are listed as follows. Firstly, students in the school take classes in the campus everyday, so that they concentrate too much on the books in front of them, leading to a fact that they do not know much about the society, which is by all means not good for them esp when they step into society. Having a part-time job help them to learn to work in a earlier time, to get along with people who have been working for some period of time and so on, all of which give them a closer view to society, which is certainly a kind of good experience for them. Secondly, doing a part-time job make students have different points of views as they should deal with people from all walks of life. This can also gives them different respects to value things. Thirdly, they know better how to earn money and have a deeper understanding of how their parents brought them up, which also let them treasure the present life. So, it is important for student to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. There are several arguments for this ruling, however. Over the past few years in Singapore, smoking has become completely banned in indoor establishments, including dance clubs. Indeed, smoking is harmful and unfortunately affects all others in the vicinity. However, as long as cigarettes remain legal in the country, I believe smokers have the right to light up if they desire. In my opinion, completely banning smoking in every restaurant is impractical and pointless. The decision to allow smoking should instead rest on the restaurant's management. Making a blanket ruling on their behalf will be detrimental to business, as patrons would avoid such establishments if banned from unwinding with a cigarette while having a drink with friends, for example. Many eateries today have outdoor and indoor seating areas. Restaurants should have the liberty to designate smoking areas within the outdoor zones to keep their smoking customers. Banning the practice altogether may please some customers, but at high costs. Such customers can be pleased in more creative and practical ways as mentioned above. For many, cigarettes are a habit and an addiction. Refraining from smoking during mealtimes may be impossible for some. The onus is on the smokers themselves to be considerate when doing so. ",B2
" Job is helpful resource for students because they can easily fulfill their expenses for Education and others expenses. Many Foreign students choose to do part-time work to help pay their tuition or living expenses. Many Foreign students emerged themselves in some type of part-time work. With the cost of education on the rise, more students are feeling to need to try to achieve some sort of finical independence. Unfortunately, in most cases finical aide and scholarships are offered on a need and or merit basis, that's why a vast majority of College students do not necessarily fall in those categories. Although, the idea of acquiring a part-time job may be discouraging to some students, it does have its advantages. For many students those who receive a steady flow from their parents, a majority of others have to budget their expenses and take on a part-time job to supplement their income. Some students receive very low package of money from their parents for their educational purposes. That's why they do part-time work in different places to fulfill their desires and other educational expenses. Job is a necessary fact for many College students'. Those students who do jobs; they can face their responsibilities with bravely. Job is good way to prove himself as a responsible and hardworking student which they can achieve their goal with their Own struggle.",B1.2
"Part time job is one of the skills every college students needs before getting a job. It is like a training for every college student who is about to embark on their future careers. It is also a source of income for those independent students, for those who pay for their tuition or for those who want to have extra allowances. Having a part time job also has its pros and cons but it is still based on the person taking it. Maybe, for him it's difficult but for other people they enjoy every minute of it. People will never be what they seem; it will always surprise you on what they can really do in life. When you have a part time job, you earn extra money and extra money. When you have extra money no one will stop you in buying whatever you want. Whether it's a Christian Dior dress or a Louis Vuitton bag, no one's stopping you in buying those things since the money is yours and you have the right to spend it on anything you want. People may think you're a spender but when you earn something by yourself and buy the things you want, you feel ecstatic, excited, happy and proud for yourself. But getting a part time job depends on whether you are busy with school projects or not, of course, studies are our first priority when it comes to school. It teaches us how to prioritize our time management because we do part time jobs for additional allowances or for money but study will always comes first for every college students around the world with part time jobs.",B2
"In today's tough job market, you need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to your field of study, will give you an edge over other applicants. Keeping a part-time job helps you learn to budget and handle money. Working part-time during college will build your character. Most of the jobs available to college students are very humbling. After you experience life as a waitress, or a janitor, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities that a college education will provide you in the future. You will realize that the world does not exist to wait on you hand and foot, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. Customer service jobs in retail and food service require you to work with challenging people, but after seeing how things are on this side of the counter, you will approach the world with a much more compassionate attitude. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus. Some of the most successful students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success, time management. If you keep your priorities straight and find a part-time job that is at least tolerable, you will be adding an important element to your future resume: experience.",B1.2
"Students need to get some form of employment experience as soon as possible so that they may compete in the marketplace. They would also learn some valuable skills to assist them in making the transition from college to full-time employment. Having a part-time job would give them a little more credibility when applying for jobs and teach them things like organizing their time, responsibility and accountability which are the basic requirements in most jobs. Unless students join the military, they will also require a certain amount of problem solving skills and be able to think independently. Having a part-time job would at least expose them to these areas so that they can see for themselves what is considered to be the normal standard and the minimum level that they would have to function at. Surprisingly, I find that many students are completely oblivious to even the most basic workplace 101 requirements and are in dire need of a reality check. If they had part-time work experience then they would be better prepared to handle the transition from college to work more readily. I also feel that most employers would expect that students had done some form of work or served an internship during their college years and have a grasp of the work environment.",C2
"I agree with this opinion. There are two reasons I think so. First, I think that it must be a very good experience for college students to have a part-time job. Most students will begin to work after they graduate from college. Then the experiences which they have gained by working part-time must help them to work smoothly. They can learn how to do - for example, how to treat customers, how to manage, how to cook or how to get a job through part-time jobs. In fact, I am going to have a part time job from June in order to experience many things. Second, college students get money by having a part-time job. It is important for them to make money because some students live alone in order to go to college. They have to earn their living by themselves. So to have a part-time job is also what they have to do. If they have a part-time job at restaurant they might be able to eat lunch or dinner for free or on the cheep. But to have a part-time job includes a problem. The problem is that students might become too busy to study. This is a very serious problem because students go to college in order to study. It is necessary for them to make the best of their limited time.",B1.2
"Cooking a healthful food from fresh ingredients is not enough for customers anymore. I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for two reasons. One reason is its danger to smoking customer's health. The other reason is its bad effect to other customer. A cigarette contains a lot of chemicals which are not healthful for a smoking customer. It is true that they cannot make any acute sickness. However, they can be kept in smoker's body. They gradually harm smoker's health. Finally, a smoker will suffer a lot of health problems, especially his respiratory problem. A cigarette gives a lot of white smoke which makes an uncomfortable environment for other customer. The smoke can blur customer's sight and hurt his eyes. Moreover, the smoke contains a lot of toxic gases. A customer who gets too much smoke may feel dizzy. And chemicals in the smoke can be kept in his body and harm his health. So, a customer can have health problems as same as a smoker. For a smoker and other customers' good health, I recommend all the restaurants to completely ban smoking. Just show 'no smoking' signs, they can save their customers from bad disease.",B1.2
"I don not think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Though I hate people smoking, but I know it is hard to stop smoking, they just need it, they can't control. So if we completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, they may feel very bad. We can give them a place to eat with smoke but others can't smell it. So it is up to restaurants how to arrange their place. Lots of people smoking when they was junior high school student, college friends make they smoke or when they are soldier, more and more people start smoking, we can not stop is, so we have to change, find a better way to solve it. I have a lot of friends smoking, they usually smoke. They smoke when they wake up, between classes, after school, after eating, during talking on phone and before they go to bed, seem they can not live without smoking, I hate that, but they just can not stop doing that. So do not just banned it, try to understand them, talk over, and find a better way together. It must be another method we can do. I don't like people smoking, but they have the freedom. Thinking more about them, they deserve it, but sometimes they are poor, too. We can be friend, not to be enemy. Banne it at all the restaurants in the country is not good.",B1.1
"I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout Japan. I have three reasons to support my position. Firstly, regarding the health of customers, more and more compelling evidence suggests that the ingestion of second-hand smoke is a direct cause of various lung disorders, predominant of which is lung cancer. Any steps that can be taken to reduce this risk should be taken by any civilized nation. Japan is by and large a socialist nation, where the good of the many is the concern of the individual; sickness and lack of public health simply undermines the health of the body-politic, which is illogical and self-defeating. Secondly, regarding the health of restaurant staff, second-hand smoke creates an unhealthy working environment. I believe that every individual has the right to work in a safe and healthy work-place. Banning smoking will remove the dangers inherent to second-hand smoke from negatively effecting employees. Finally, there is the issue of social acceptance of smoking, or rather lack thereof. A restaurant, or restaurant chain, that bans smoking on its premises sends out a message to society in general: that smoking is unacceptable in the presence of non-smokers, of whom there are more and more in the light of recent shifts in medical awareness and social health. Therefore, for these reasons, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.",C2
"The mission of university is to train students to be independent and all rounded intelligence. Under this presuppose, one should not neglect the training and experience given by part time job. Having a part time job helps students learn to manage their time well and be responsible for their own duty. Some part time in particular matches with their own field of study may also enhance their chance of learning and apply what they learn in classes. However, one should not say that part time job is an obligation. As part of the university students are supposed to be future scholars and professors in their own field, they need to focus more on their academic work. Say for example, a professional scientist, mathematician, historian or sociologist need not gain working experience. It is easy to see that professors and scholars need more advance skills like critical thinking, methodology and modeling to explain phenomenon. On the other hand, part time job trains practical skills like documentary work or even labor work. These skills have clearly no relation to their future research. One could gain nothing from doing a part time job but lost time for their further study and research. For them, part time job is just an obstacle to their success. University education is supposed to be free and student oriented. If a student want to have their career in practical fields or industry, they may have part time job to gain experience. If a student has already decided to continue to study and live with knowledge and research, part time job means nothing to them. Therefore, the importance of part time job depends on one's ambition. It could not be regarded as'important' but just'useful'.",B1.1
"Agree with that should not be smoking in restaurants around the country because the restaurant is a restaurant for dining. A public restaurant to anyone who does not supposed to smoke inside the restaurant. The bad will happen, it does not happen, but with male smoking only But it will affect the people around inside the cylinder with the people. The opinion that smoking in restaurants. But the disadvantages that both the internal and external The image of social outsiders look. The impact that followed. The owner should be made no-smoking signs in restaurants or public places. Smoking is not allowed to see the sign prominently or a restaurant owner should be prepared places for smokers to sit it. It would be better for him be smoke in restaurant. A good government should be a law banning smoking in restaurants or public places that should be advertising to the negative effects of smoking and the distribution more pronounced. And there should be more stringent penalties than ever. To the environment in general society and individuals will be happier to see people smoking, quit smoking. All people who don't smoke will be happy too that they don't smell tobacco and don't get hurt from smoking.",B1.1
Having a part time job is important especially for college students even though they don't need it because their parents can support them financially. By the time you get in to college you are expected to become responsible young adults. You are given the freedom to do what you want because your expected that you know what is good for you and what is bad. But you are also expected that you can stand on your own by this time. Having part time job while your also a college student teaches you a lot of things it's like an early training ground and gives you an idea about what it feels like to independent. It helps you to be a more efficient person because you need to be good in time management in order to balance your studies and your part time job. It also teaches you the value of money; you will experience how hard it is to earn money. You also need to learn how to budget your money identifying your needs and wants. Having a part time job while you're still studying is hard but there is a solution in every problem as long as you want to overcome it. It's an early training ground for a college student to learn what would happen after they graduate it will be hard because you really need to manage time well in order to fulfil your duties as a student and as an employee. But after all the hard work the whole experience will worth it you will new things and be a more responsible individual.,B1.2
"It is reported by the World Health Organization that there are more than five million death caused by smoking. It is easy to see that smoking is very bad for our health. What's worse, second hand smoking hurt our body when we have no sense. This problem is so serious that we have to do something to protect ourselves. The most effective and easiest suggestion is banning smoking at all the restaurant in the country. Most people in the world don't like to smoke and large numbers of them even hate it because of its uncomfortable gas. So ban smoking not only meets people's will, but also save their life. The tobacco is also very expensive, which means smoking waste a lot of money, so quite smoking can also save money. The restaurant is the most important pubic place in our daily life so that banning smoking here can make the biggest and best effect. We do not want to be hurt when we have a good time, which is very disappointed. Another reason is that restaurant is a closed place which air is very hard to flow and people do not move often so that the bad gas can't discharge and cause great harm. There is not any benefit we can take from smoking, and smoking hurt smokers' and others' health greatly. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.2
"There are many disadvantages to smoking. Smoking has bad effects on our healthy. The one who smoke in public, not only affect himself, but also affect the others around him. However, more and more people join the group of smoking, especially the young people. They are curious to smoking and are attracted to have a try. What's more, some people smoke in anywhere such as restaurants without others' feeling. Face this phenomenon; some people suggest that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. The restaurants should be very comfortable where people can enjoy their dinner and chat with each other. But now in the restaurants we can't be so happily that we want to leave as quickly as possible. Why? Because almost every man is smoking, there is no room for people to breath. The women and children all can't stand completely. Also the guests can not have the sense of which family are eating together at home, they will feel disappointed to the restaurants. And it is very hard for the restaurants to develop in the future. However, some people say that smoking in the restaurants is their right. They can smoke freely. In my view, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. We do anything shouldn't affect others.",B1.1

And they can not concentrate on their studies. They are the future leaders of the country and nation. So if the government gives the funds and scholarships to the poor and needy students.

"We have debate in the class about Should Government Ban Smoking In The Restaurant. I as the person who contra or disagree about intervention of the government to ban smoking in the restaurant. Actually the majority of people know about the dangerous of smoke and they know what is the best and worst for them, however the majority of them are smoker. I think if the government want to reduce the smoker can use other ways such as give elucidation and more information about cigarette or ban smoking in the hospital, etc. As we know that restaurant have management that manage it in order. I am sure that each management in each restaurant will give the best for their restaurant. When the government ban smoking in the restaurant, the management of the restaurant will have difficulties to get a lot of guest and because of this the restaurants will bankrupt because they have no income for manage and regulate the restaurant. Furthermore, it will increase a mount of jobless that made a new problem for government. I assume that the management of restaurants will give the best for their guest in order to they feel comfortable and convenience with their serve both of the smoker or passive smoker, such as provide a room of smoking area for the smoker. The guest who have behavior to smoke after eating will be enjoyable because they have special place to do it without disturb other people. In conclusion the government should not ban smoking in the restaurants because restaurants have management that can manage and give the best for the guest. Other options for the government to decrease that bad effect of smoke are give more information to public and ban in some important place such as hospital.",B1.1

" I don't think smoking should be banned completely banned at all in restaurants in the country. On the one hand, we have to admit that cigarettes are harmful for both the smokers and second-hand smokers. But on the other hand, I think that smoking can be not completely banned in restaurants if some measures are taken. First of all, smoking turns to be most smokers' habit which is impossible to be quitted. For them, smoking is a form of killing time or way of venting their happiness or anger. On some occasions, business talk in restaurants for example, inviting others to smoke can be treated as a manner which will create a harmonious atmosphere. So we don't have to ban the smoking completely, to some degree, smoking can be partly banned in restaurants. Restaurants can design smoking zones for smokers. People must smoke in special zone so that non-smokers won't take in cigarette gas. Some restaurants can charge people more money if they smoke, which will let smokers try not to smoke in restaurants. These measures are humanistic rather than a serious decree, so it's both convenient for smokers and non-smokers. Personally, though smoking is bad for people's health, we can't forbid it at once because it has come to be someone's life habit. We should respect smokers' habit and also others' health at the same time.",B1.2

"With social development, smoking forbidden takes more and more important place in building the civil society. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is bad for health, and smoking in restaurants put bad effect to other people. Also, we need to build a more harmony society. First, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is harmful to our body, especially while smoking in a restaurant. As we all know, cigrette equals poisson. But we can't ban cigrettes, for the contribution to the economy given by the cigrette company. So what we can do is to stop smoking in restaurants to protect people from second-hand smoke. Second, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant may annoy other people. From my perspective, smoke in public is rude, for smoking is a kind of private behavior, and many people hate the smell of smoke. So smoking in a restaurant may let people feel unhappy. Last, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because we need a more harmony society. According to what has been mentioned above, smoking makes other people feel uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is against what we are seekingâ€”a harmony society.

"I really agree about this topic. Tobacco is really not an absolute point of the beneficial. Tobacco destroys all of things in the world. For example, health, animals, mind, flowers, water, air, etc. Tobacco is only the legitimate drug. The drug is prohibited. It should not be recommended. It should be banned from restaurants and all places. Non-smoking in the restaurants is etiquette. Smokers must unconditionally smoke out of place. Smokers are very annoying. They have no sense of responsibility. Smokers should be considerate non-smokers. Smokers should be ashamed. Smokers in the restaurants should be punished. It is very harmful to smoking people. Its smoke remains a long distance spread in the air. Also its smoke will offend the other person. It will harm other people indirectly. People have a right to drink clean air. Smoking people in the restaurants is selfish. The unpleasant smell of tobacco smoke is banned in the restaurants. The restaurant should be clean. But tobacco is very not clean. It is very dirty.

"I agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. With the following ideas, I would like to briefly elaborate the reasons why. There are three main reasons. First, part-time job give students a good chance to interact with people outside the campus. It is a progress of learning to adapt the future lifestyle, as well as taking the step of knowing the society. The progress of learning plays an essential part in each of our life, especially for college students who are going to graduate and start joining the company and work. Second, getting a part-time job help students establish their way of living in the society. It is a process for one to learn to take more responsibility as becoming a more mature adult. By taking more responsibility, I mean taking more considerations before making decisions or taking actions, as well as being responsible for any out coming results. Last but not least, having a part time job can be seen as a series of trainings. Through the trainings, students develop their own and appropriate way to deal with all sorts of issues. Also, by building up their own way of managing all kinds of tasks, students get a clearer idea about how to face the problems in the future. Besides studying, having a part time job in college can surely give students a picture of how the work, or how the world they are going to enter look like. Additionally, part-time job is a great opportunity for us to take what we have learned in to practical. It is important to have knowledge, but it is also important to know how to use the knowledge. Thus, I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"The issue of banning smoking has been argued in this decade, and this has been in the hot seat recently. I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, as the cigarette contains different kinds of harmful substances shown in many discoveries and some of the substances may cause tumors and lead to death. The cigarette also contains some chemicals, making users addict to it. Air pollution may arise in addition to smoking. Some people may be annoyed by the smoke that being breathed out, especially at indoor area, in which the area is less ventilated. However, some may argue it should not be banned at all restaurants, for example, the restaurant managers, since it may affect the flow of customers, including smokers. As they may argue that some of the customers may choose not to go. Also, there are some difficulties in defining the area of the restaurants if the laws are made, such as the sitting area outside the restaurant and the outdoor catering area, and another problems may arise in related to the penalty of violate the laws. In conclusion, I support with the idea of banning smoking at all restaurants, but there are still some unsolved aspects have to be tackled in order to be in the regulations.",B1.2
"Currently most public places had banned smoking by law. The only areas for smokers to smoke are in the ""yellow box"" or the ""smoking cubicle"". This is a good decision make by the government as it shows that the government are aware of the health implications on the general public and are taking action to protect them. It will be good to have a complete ban of smoking in restaurants as it will allow the customers to have clean air. Even with the smoking cubicle that is isolated from the main area, the smoke can still travel to the main area since air cannot be controlled. The residue left by the cigarette is dirty and make the place looks unsightly. Smoking will affect the hygiene of the restaurants too. As explained earlier, the residue is very dirty. If customers see the residue on many parts of the floors in the restaurants, it will give n impression that the owners did not clean the place and will defiantly affect the experience felt by the customers. Therefore, smoking should be banned in all restaurants. It will cause inconvenient to the smokers; i believe they will understand when they understand the reasons behind it. The public will benefit the most from such as ban. ",B1.2
"I don't think that I can agree with this because here in the States, it hasn't worked out very well when they introduced bans here in a few cities. I guess that the air is a bit cleaner but now, everybody that smokes just goes outside so all that is happening really, is that they are just transferring the smoke from on location to another. One of my buddies says that he likes to smoke in the fresh air anyway. Seriously though, Japan has a lot of people and space is at premium so if everybody goes outside to smoke, then there won't be much room to move and they will block all the pedestrian walkways and in some suburbs, the small streets will be blocked as well. While there are serious risks for everybody that inhales smoke, moving it from one location to another is not going to solve the problem and will just create new problems. I think that the best thing to do is to just have separate restaurants for smokers and non-smokers. People can still eat the same foods and it just becomes a case of geography as to where they eat. Problem solved as far as the restaurant side of things goes.",C2
"I agree with the opinion, but I want to change the words in Japan to in the world. And I have three reasons why I choose this. First, by smoking, we can not find the taste of food well, so if someone smoke in the restaurant, other people around him can not find the taste of food well. So if we appreciate the fact that we can eat food, we should not smoke in the restaurant. Second, smoking is bad for health, so if someone smoke in the restaurant, other people around him are made bad impact from him. Especially, smoke which other people take in is worse than smoke which person who smoke directly take in, and people who take in smoke which is from smoking person is likely to be lung cancer. So people who smoke should stop to smoke before other people say to you I wish you stop to smoke. Third, in the place where many people gather, there may be a person who do not like cigarette, so people who smoke should stop to smoke to make a good mood. Consequently, I agree with this opinion. But I say again, the words in Japan should change to in the world.",A2
" Nowadays, more and more people smoke. When you walk on the street you can see people smoking, when you are shopping in the shops you also can see people smoking, you can see the scenery in many places, but whether we should ban smoking in the restaurant. Different people have different views about this question. In my opinion we should ban smoking in the restaurant because it is where people eat food and have a rest there. If someone smoke there it can affect other people, people' emotion can be bad then so they may not come to the restaurant to have meals any more. And we all know smoking is very bad for our health. It can cause smokers to have some disease. Non-smokers sit around them when they smoke can also have some diseases. So smoking should be banned in the restaurant to keep everyone safe and healthy. Smoking in public is also a bad thing, it can affect your personal image. Children in the restaurant may learn from your example. But sometimes there are many people in the restaurant so people have to wait for a long time to have meals so they feel very boring to smoke, it needs restaurants to take actions to improve the efficient. In a word, I agree with the opinion that we should ban smoking in the restaurant.",B1.1
"I believe that it can be beneficial for college students to have a part-time job, but its necessity depends very much on his/her circumstances. A part time job, foremost, can provide students with a source of income. This will reduce some of the financial burden that their educational fees and other miscellaneous spending place on their families. Working for their own income (or a portion thereof) also nurtures in them a responsibility for managing their personal spending and earning patterns. It is likely that experiencing the effort required to generate income will incentivise frugality and wiser spending decisions. Furthermore, part-time jobs allow students to hone new or existing skills. A tutoring job, for example, not only allows the student to keep his/her mind active and constantly practise the subject, but also forces him/her to acquire a whole new trove of skills relating to teaching. An administrative job can prepare the student for administrative work --- which exists in most regular jobs --- required in future, as well as allow him/her to exercise organisational skills. On the other hand, a part-time job may detract a student's attention from his/her studies. A significant amount of time and effort inevitably has to be dedicated to the job, and this comes at the opportunity cost of revision and other school work. Should the student not be able to cope with both simultaneously, it would definitely be better for him/her to focus on studies and perhaps take up temporary job opportunities during the holidays instead. Therefore, I feel that a part-time job can be an important part in a college student's development, but need not necessarily be a priority. ",B2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To begin with, they can not only release parents' pressure toward finance but learn how to manage their own salary; furthermore, they can be financial independent from parents gradually through part-time job. In addition, taking part-time job is helpful to learn the experience in the society. You have to check again and again and ask people who have managed the job for a long time before doing anything, such as understanding which tea is the professor's favorite before giving him the tea. What's more, college students can learn the attitude toward the work in the process of part-time job. For instance, college students can understand ""apology"" is the first thing they have to do when discovering that they do something wrong, it is beneficial to college students because they have to take advantage of the attitude when they attending job in the society. To conclude, taking part-time job is really beneficial to college students, they can not only earn money but train themselves how to manage their own salary; furthermore, college students can gain social experience from the part-time job, cultivating the serious attitude toward job in the future.",B1.1
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job For me the part time job is very â€“very important for us college students because with part time job we can know how to do some work and we can have experience for work and it will be useful in our live as college student. Part time job just the way for us to the success that what am I think about and it will be give us some experience before us to work for our self. It is the way become true entrepreneur. That knowledge is very important to us and I must try to work in part time because I must have the experience Part time job is useful to us and good for lesson to us how hard your parents have to works for us. I am sure that experience will be not forgotten and will be use in the our business later and to be true entrepreneur. Not just big experience we need small experience too because we start from the bottom not from the top. Because of that we little experience too. So the part time job will be very important because it will give us some new experience.,B1.1
"Smoking will also addictive, but I rarely around people who smoke. So I think smoking will affect one another. I often read the news reports, how many people in Taiwan a year because of smoking suffering from illness or even death, and the adverse effects of secondhand smoke far more than people imagine, but the law has no way to establish clear and effective laws and regulations. After all, this is a personal habit so the implementation of the law can not do. So I think the school Education is important, clearly let people know smoking is the kind of bad habit. In addition to other personal health problems, smoking will bring very bad effect on the environment. When I see a smoker on the road when they will not take away cigarette butts, but he readily threw in the street. I think this is very good. This habit will cause environmental mess, and the destruction of the beauty of the road. I think this is very good. This habit will cause environmental mess, and the destruction of the beauty of the road. So I hope people can think about what smoking can be good for you.

"For a college student, to have a part time job is not really necessary, but it worth to do it. First, part time job, will trained our abilities before the real job. Besides that, we can get some of new experience. Second, we can learn or become realize how hard our parent is working for us, so we can appreciate our parent's hard working. Apart from that we can learn independent, but it is not mean we are already do not need our parent's help. it is just training for us to not always spoiled and depend everything to our parent. Although we have part time job, but our priorities is not working, but studying as a college student. Some student may ""sacrifice"" their test for part time job. If that job have better opportunity to our future it is alright, but if that is not make better opportunities for our future, and make some wrong thinking for part time job, how it's become? It will make they purpose to working just to get money as much as they can, buy something not necessary that very expensive, etc. With that thinking, the purpose of part time job is become mess.

"Smoking has always known to be bad to health. In fact, there is no good arguments, nor acceptable arguments, for anyone to argue for smoking as a beneficial activity. Smoking is bad, and second-hand smoking is even more harmful to our body. This is why I do agree strongly that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Although it is up to the individual to pick up smoking, and there can be no law enforced which forces smokers to quit smoking, smokers should be considerate to the non-smokers. It is their choice to ruin their health, however, it is not right to aggravate the health of the innocent people who are around them when they are smoking. Especially in Singapore where restaurants are usually air-conditioned and enclosed, smoking should all the more be banned to prevent the public from breathing in the toxic smoke. Moreover, restaurants, being a public area, should be a place that is comfortable for everyone to be in. Being completely banned might give rise to protests from smokers, and they may even resort to gathering outside the restaurant to take their smoke break. Nevertheless, this should not deter us from trying to enforce a comfortable and healthy dining environment for everyone. In addition, there is also a pertinent need to convey the importance of being considerate, as well as the harmful effects of smoking and second-hand smoking, to the smokers. ",B1.2

Abandon the traditional mindset, many college students actually took up a part-time job to earn additional income, thus taking off a huge load from their parents' shoulders and saving for their own future such as school fees for overseas university, which should end up being a significant contribution to the college tuition. Even though academic are the main focus, students also realized the importance of having work experience. Society nowadays expects students to have working experience therefore part-time job are started as early as in college life and internship is included in school modules for students to gain practical experiences off campus and gain nourishment from outer world. Students also understand the benefits of that it would help to foster values, better communication skills, honed time management skills and picking up relevant skills through the working environment thus, it helps to aspire chances with a killer cover letter and resume, standing out and impressed their future employer. In conclusion, taking up part-time job could provide one with endless benefits, enhancing in both academic and social skills and such skills help students to stay ahead before entering into the working world.

"No one would deny that smoking is harmful to one's health, and in public locations, to others'. Oddly enough, many would rather stay ignorant to the negative impact of cigarette, continuing to cripple their own bodies and caring little for other's bad feeling. For those who are cigarette afflicted, smoking is mistaken for the only available way to release their stress from any sorts of aspects of life. Therefore, they would rather turn to smoking than come up with some healthier way for an escape from daily routines and pressure. The thought of quitting smoking for the sake of one's health is always fleeting for buying cigarette and smoke is so easy and effortless that the experience of giving up smoking is usually discouraging. From the viewpoint of a non-smoking person, the behavior of smoking might be extremely intolerant. In public occasion, there's no way smoking is acceptable. People feel uncomfortable with the smell and expect potential harm to their health by second-hand smoking. Thus there's no doubt that people who smoke are always getting together as a peer group, away from their family and other friends that are not able to stand the smoke. Under this circumstance where no positive suggestions are given and such bad habit is shared, the way to quitting smoking is never taken. To overcome the thirst for cigarette, encouragement and opinions from one's family and friends is crucial. Once one is aware of the feeling of being annoyed by a smoker and some better way to ease one's stress, smoking is certain to be ridded off.",B1.2
"Books, clothes, cosmetics, food, outing all things what a college student faces have something to do with the money. In that case, more and more college students tend to find a part-time job so as to pay for their rising expenses. As far as I can see, the importance of having a part-time job is more than that, since it can bring many benefits to us. Helping students to acquire the ability of management is one of the profits. College students are used to such things as asking parents for allowance or buy whatever they like regardless of money. When they are out of money, it's time for them to beg parents for some again. Having a part-time job will help students to learn the difficulty and uneasiness of work, thus to understand the precious of the money earned by parents, which enables college students to have some ideas about money management, for example, think twice before spending. Another advantage of doing a part-time job is that it provides students a perfect situation to practice and enhance personal skills. Whatever job you do, tutor, waiter (waitress), salesperson the ability of communication and social functions will be greatly improved. Last but not least, having a part-time job is a good experience to students who are stepping into the society later on, for it offers an opportunity to apply what you learn, no matter your knowledge or social skills, to reality. You can find if it works and discover the shortcomings of your own, in order to better improve and understand yourself. In a nutshell, a part-time job is a lot more than just having some extra income, college students can attain quite a number of benefits, which can ensure them not only a more comfortable current life, but also a promising future.",B1.2
"It is important for collage students to have part time job. I have two reasons. One is to make money. Collage students have much time comparing with members of society. Adults often say, I have money but no time. We can do what we want to do as far as time permitted. Therefore they need money. The other is to have many opportunities through part time job. Part time job enables us not only to make money but also to make friends, have a sense of responsibility, learn manner of society and so on. As far as for me, I have had a part time job and worked at Doughnut shop for 3 years. I work from 5:00 to 9:00 and go to school twice or three times a week. Since I started a part time job, I have changed. For example, I contact with wide range people from children to old people through part time job. I learned how to talk with each people. The skill helped me at interviews of job hunting. Consequently I could receive notice of informal decision. In case of me, I sometimes travel by money I earned. I have been to India, Australia, South Africa and so on. I had invaluable experiences there. I couldn't get such experiences by pocket money from parents. But there is one thing that I may not forget. The main work for students is not part time job but study. So students must do part time job as it doesn't interrupt study.",B1.1
"I agree to this idea. I think Japanese government should prohibit smoking at all the restaurants in the country. I hate smoking. Smoking is bad for the health. I want to be sure to take good care of myself. And if someone smoke by me, my clothes get smell. I must suffer from my clothes tobacco's smell. If someone smoke at the table, it get me more irritant. I like to eat, so, I want to eat in comfortable situation. Tobacco makes this situation and mood bad. Because of like these reason, I disagree to smoking at the restaurant. If it is allowed, I want to prohibit tobacco it self. For example, if the government impose a more high tax on tobacco, there are few smoker in Japan. I think, when smoker want to smoke, they should go the place there are no people. So the government should increase smoking room by tobacco's tax. If it come true, we don't have to inhale tobacco's smoke. But it is true that there are many people love smoking. So if they that there are want to smoke, I want to them smoke where not cause us annoying. I want the Japan to be the cantury where the air is clean and not float bad smells.",B1.1
"I think college students should have a part-time job for several reasons. First of all; they are different from the others because they have more experiences in their life. Working job has many problems to solve. If they can find out, it means they have a step to learn the meaning of life. Second, they may save family expenses. It is fact that part-time job make a little money but it can help their parents to pay expenses in the house. Third, it can help them to know the valve of money. If they have a part-time job, they will realize the difficulty to get money. Maybe they will spend less money because of this. Finally, if they have a part-time to do, they do not have time do bed thing, for example, addicted the drug, drink alcohol, smoking etc. Fourth, the part time job give college student to know to adjust oneself because in the work have a many people who is relate to this job. If you don't adjust oneself maybe the job can't good. For many reasons above. I really agree with College students ought to have a part-time job. At least they can help their family to save the cost of living.",B1.1
"I think that it would do the world of good if all students took on a part-time job while at college or university. I do have one caveat though and that is, that colleges should also provide some form of counselling or advice that would assist with preparing students in managing their time and their mind set, before going off in search of work. It always sounds easy to get a part-time job however, getting one and then keeping it while maintaining the required study levels is easier said than done for many students and they do struggle with it. Admittedly, there are a few students who handle both easily and without any apparent issues but in my opinion, these students are already in possession of the correct mindset and organisational skills or have learned them very quickly. For those with less experience, this may not be the case and I feel quite strongly that it is a lot easier to prepare than repair as the saying goes. Given the right preparation, all students should be able to combine both activities without mishap and also with the minimum of stress. This would allow them to not only enjoy the benefits of earning a wage but to also progress with their studies in a more relaxed and conducive frame of mind.",C2
"I extremely agree with the topic, don't you want to lost your nice feeling while sitting in the restaurants just cause by the smoker? Surely, most people in this planet think about themselves more than the others. So that is the cause to have nowadays crime. In the restaurants, there are many signs about ""Don't Smoking""; you can see them in all of the poles and in the walls there. Banning about smoking in the restaurants must be having an extremely taboo for in first time, I think. How we can do it? At first, Have enough security guards, then show the sign note ""Don't Smoking"" and follow with ""Fine (the most expensive pride) on one cigarette"" Do that together with when someone or some people against that sign, Call the security guards to manage on them. If every restaurant can do that, nice feeling that leads someone going to go to restaurant where is the place for meeting with old friends, for dinner in the great time with the family, for celebrating with the victory, for dating with beautiful girl and nice boy, and especially for relaxing yourself with the great meal for charting energy in your body to doing your job excellently.",B1.1
"It is important for college student to have a part time job. I agree with this statement, because college student can be more independent than before, college student can concern about his studies and concern about anything like do part time job. The college student must have setting their time if they do a part time job. If not, their studies will be break and he just concern to their job. Although they can set their time, they can help their parents paying his studies at the college, the salary can be use to buy something to support his college, buying books, pay boarding house, and many others. It is like my senior story, my senior is in sixth grade, he do part time job as a private teacher, in a month, he can makes money at least Rp. 400. 000, around US $ 50. he use it to buying books and anything that he needs, he not asking to his parents to buy that, he use his own money except paying semester bills, he says to me that not too difficult to do part time job, the most important thing is we can setting our time, and keeps our health to do our studies and part time job.

"Money plays a very important role for everyone. It gives us opportunities for us to have a particular thing whether it is a necessity or just for satisfaction. But most people are often very busy or have a hectic schedule thus giving them no chance to earn some money for a living. Part-time jobs are great for people like these. It gives them the chance to earn good money for just working for a short span of time per day. It is usually less than 40 hours per week more or less 5 hours per day. Part time jobs are also great for students in preparation for adult life. It gives them the experience of what their parents are going through; working for a living. It gives them the satisfaction when they know they deserved it because they worked hard for the salary. It also makes them realize their strengths and weaknesses along the way. But most of all, it teaches them respect towards their father and mother because they will know that money is very hard to earn yet they spend so much just to feed your hungry tummy, satisfy your wants, give you all the necessities, and give you a good education.",B1.2
"Many students are having part time jobs these days. It became one of the cultures among young people. They work at cafè¾¿, fast food store, a convenient store and so on. Mostly the reason they look for part time jobs is to earn money because there are many things they want to buy in twenties. But some other says that having a part time is an important experience to learn a real world. I don't agree with that. It might be helpful if a student has a part time job just for a month. One month is enough time to learn how hard earning money is or how tough this world is. But if the student works for a long time, I think that is the time to have problems. The works they do is usually mere work not professional. They easily get tired compare to others who don't have a part time job and it also influence their grades. I think school grades, traveling, chasing dream are the things truly important to young people. There are so many thing they should care bating part time jobs. I think if you want to experience the world, an intern ship would be better than a part time job.",B2
"I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Or if the kids can give the parents the money that is earned by them, their parents will be very happy.

""I don't know if I'd even be a teacher today if I hadn't. "" A first-generation college student, Natapong came from a hard-working family who had little money to spare. As a student at Nanangpattanasuksa School, I had hoped to study engineering after graduation.

"People know that smoking is harmful to health, but many people have to involuntary smoking. In different places, there are different rules, for example, in the restaurants. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are many reasons. Firstly, there are many smokers in China. Not only the boys smoke, but also the girls do. I know many of my friends smoke. They all know that smoke does harm to their health, but they still smoke. They are addicted to it. If someone smokes, it harms himself as well as others. So taking into account the health of others, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, because restaurant is a place where many people stay. Secondly, Smoking in restaurants is an expense of others interests. People go to restaurants for a good meal; you smoke, so it is impolite to others. What's more, Gases produced by cigarettes polluted the environment in the restaurants. Many people dislike it, in addition, it probably influence people's minds. Above all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It will do good for ourselves. Then we can have a better body and a better environment.",B1.2
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Of course, I know that there are many people who smoke every day. However, I think it does not need that people smoke at restaurant. I will show you my opinions. I do not smoke because I do not like the smell of cigarette. When I go for a meal with friends who smoke, I cannot smell and taste meals. I cannot stand the smell of cigarette. I want to eat delicious meals without the smell of cigarette. I do not smoke, so I cannot understand why people smoke at the table. However, it does not mean that smoking should be completely banned at all space in the world. I do not smoke, but I admit that there are people who smoke. However I think there are many people who do not like the smell of cigarette. So, when they go to restaurants, I think they smoke outside the restaurants. You may say that there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at many restaurants. However, both seats do not completely be separated. So, sometimes cigarette smoke flows to nonsmoking seats. Even though smoking seats and nonsmoking seats are separated at some restaurants, I think people who smoke should smell and taste meals without the smell of cigarette. I think it is bad manners to smoke at the table. Because, cooks want to make people happy by his cooking, they cook hard. We should appreciate his cooking. I have heard that people who had smoked get fat as soon as they stopped smoking. It is because they can smell and taste meals more without the cigarette. So, I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.",A2
"In my opinion. I think part time job of Thai students are very good, because it help themselves and parent. If their family are poor them must work part time after finish class. Past time job are very necessary for some Thai student, because poor family. It does not easy for someone, but it easy for diligent student, because them must look for money for themselves. I agree with part time job and it is best idea for pool student. However study is the most important than part time job. It have time enough should make, but if not time should not make. Sometime working part time cannot help them, because working help look for money only, but it cannot help good study. If we look into point important of part time job, for example, look for money, using time and save money. After finish work them must do homework and get up to university working part time can make them have not time enough study. While them friend shopping, but them must work part time it very different. I would to talk past time job, it is necessary for some student for example. For pool student and them would like to help parent.",A2
"I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Usually by the time students get to college, their daily allowances given by parents may not be sufficient. This is because there are not as many restrictions for college students as compared to being at a younger age, so they can hang out longer and more often with friends and therefore increasing their expenditures. They are also easily influenced on their wants over needs which may result in overspending. Not all parents are willing to hand out extra cash to their children to satisfy their wants instead of needs. Getting a part-time job helps to sustain their lifestyles and enables them to spend whatever they earn, or there are also others who want to save can save more compared to relying only on their allowances. Some students may also think that they are old enough to take care of themselves and not rely on their parents all the time so they will earn their own allowances by getting a part-time job. Although most students tend to get part-time jobs, there are also those who do not need a job at all because their families have higher incomes and are willing to support and maintain their children's lifestyles. The parents can just give them whatever money they ask for and buy them whatever they want. ",B1.2
"Part time job is a hot topic that often discussed by college students and their parents. During the college, whether to have a part time job is a problem worth thinking. Many people hold the idea that college students should find a part time job. For one thing, having a job and making money can make a children more independent. They will learn more from the society rather than the books only. For another thing, students will make a time plan if they have a part time job which can make for their job later. What's more, using the money made by themselves is very proud and happy. So, why not have a part time job? But someone have the opponent opinion. They think part time job has more disadvantages than advantages. On the one hand, it will take them so much time to do the jobs that they cannot devote themselves in the studying which is likely more meaningful. On the other, stepping into the society may be bad for them. If they cannot control themselves well, they will be trapped into the lair full of frightfulness. As far as I am concerned, if we can control ourselves well and having a part time job have no bad effect on studying, just do it.",B1.2
"Smoking should be ban at all the restaurants in Singapore. Firstly, smoking will affect the health of others. This is because secondhand smoking will be much more harmful than smoking itself. This will cause unnecessary harm to those non-smokers in the restaurants. Furthermore, Secondly, the smokers will set as a wrong role model for the youths. If smoking can be commonly seen everywhere including at the restaurants, the youths in the country may have the wrong perception that smoking is a very trendy stuff and thus they might want to give it a try. They might develop the mentality Since the adults are smoking, why can't we smoke? This can lead to a very harmful long term trend for the nation as a whole. Thus to minimize the exposure of smoking to the younger generation, it should be ban in the restaurants. While the fact that smokers may argue that this will infringe their basic human rights, they have already infringe the rights of other non-smokers by causing them to breathe in secondhand smoke. With the great number of disadvantages and the little benefits that smoking bring to the society, smoking should be ban at all the restaurants in Singapore. ",B1.2

Second is that money is important to do what college students want to do. Firstly, I will explain why part-time job is good experiences for college students. They can learn many things by having a part-time job. For example, I work as a tutor. I learn how important it is to communicate with others, to greet each other, how hard it is to teach something and to get money. I think that what I learn from a part-time job is very useful in my life. If college students don't have a part-time job, they can't realize how hard it is to work, until they have real job. Therefore they worry about their jobs and they might quit their jobs. Secondly, I will explain why money is important to do what college students want to do. In this world, we need money to do something. By the way, how can college students get money, if they don't have a part-time job? Maybe, their families give them money, but they are not children yet, so they should get money to do something by themselves. For example, I want to enter a graduate school, so I need much money to enter. Therefore I have a part-time job and work very hard to save money.

"Most university students do part time job because they want to earn more money for them to afford entertainments, buying fashionable clothes, hanging around with their newly met friends in the university. Most of the people may think that those students only focus on earning money, expanding their social scope rather than their study in the university. Whether it is important for a university student to get a part time job depends on what he or she wan to get from it. University students are already adults. They should have ability to determine the importance of having a part time job. For me, it is important for me because I would like to earn more working experience during the university life so as to well prepare myself for adapting the society after I have graduated for the university. However, I will always put my study before part time jobs since the main purpose for me to be a university student is to get further education on my major subject and all round development.

"In this day and age, the situation in Singapore calls for a high level of dedication to studies for students. Especially in the case of higher level academic pursuits, students will have little or not extra time to even give themselves a break from schoolwork, much less a part-time job. Hence in this aspect, I find that college student will be unlikely to juggle a part-time job in Singapore. However, circumstances may call for the need and importance for a part-time job. For instance, family financial situation may require students to head out to earn some part-time income for the family. For such students, it is imperative to work part-time for the extra income, which his/her family may depend on. Another circumstance is the case of on-the-job learning. This is an important issue because Singapore should head on to focus on hands-on learning instead of classroom learning. Many argue that the student will learn more actually doing things himself then to be force-fed with information and more information. Such work-learning are termed as internships. For this reason, I also believe that college students could head out to the workforce early. Therefore, it depends on the circumstances if college students should or should not get a part-time job.

If a restaurant allows smoking in the smoking to the health of people who do not play any more will not come to the restaurant. The restaurant will be full only of smokers.

"Some smokers claim that it is unfair it all restaurants banned smoking, restaurants shall provide some places for smoking. I totally disagree with their opinion. I am going to express my opinion on completely banned of smoking. First, banning smoking completely at restaurant can lead them to give up smoking. As smoking harm smokers' bodies. Carbon monoxide reduce the oxygen in the blood, smokers will feel dizzy. Tar is carcinogenic substances. Thus, if smokers go dining out, they will smoke less so that their bodies can be improved. Besides, allowing smoking in the restaurant partly will affect other people. Smokers may say that the restaurants can segment a part as smoking zone. However, as the restaurants are using central air-conditioner, the harmful substances will spread out though the air adjusting system. Second-hand smoking harms people more because they do not have a filter. As a result, smokers cannot avoid harming other innocent people, people who do not smoke will suffer from these smokers. To conclude, smoking should be banned completely, it can help both smokers and non-smokers. If they can stop smoking in the restaurant, as time goes by, smoker will get rid of tobacco. The world will be cleaner and cleaner.",B1.2
"It is true that smoking is being a habit for many people nowadays.

They breathe about 20% of smoke that they produce when smoking. Passive smokers, the people who do not smoking and be around the active smoker, breathe 80% of smoke that active smokers produce. Smoking is bad for us. I am not just talking about health. We already knew that smoking can cause many disease such as cancer, impotency, and also bad for pregnancy. In my opinion, smoking is just like burning your money. You buy cigarettes and burn it for nothing. Smoking is also wasting time. Well, I admitted that not all people like to do nothing but smoking to spend their time, but this habit is also popular. Some of them do their activity while smoking. This is also not good since they can affect passive smokers around them. Restaurant is one of popular public places. Nice place to spend time with family and friend. It will be many people there. Imagine if there are smoke around you while you talking, eating, and enjoying your beverages. Breathing such poisoned smoke while you wanted to relax. It is just uncomfortable and bad for many people health. In conclusion, I agreed that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. For many reasons, smoking may be good for the smokers themselves, but more reasons about smoking's side effect should make us realize that smoking is a bad habit.",B1.2
"I think that it is great for college students to have a part-time job, but for the sake of argument I will be taking the opposite side, that is, the side of things college student should not have a part-time job. When a college student has a part-time job, they basically have an excuse to not focus very hard on their schoolwork. It's basically like giving them a free pass to under achieve. College students in many ways already have an occupation and that occupation is to go to school. Furthermore, part-time work is very boring and not a lot of college students like to do boring things. We want to have fun and experience a lot of new things in college, but we have our whole lives to work but we don't have our whole lives to have fun. Also, it is very hard to find a part-time job that is flexible enough and allows studying so that students could use their time effectively even while working. The best work study positions are taken by the smartest kids and the employers to want to hire anyone who doesn't have a 4. 0 GPA. For these reasons, college student should focus on other things that part-time work while they are in college.",C2
It is said that a healthy body has a healthy mind. One cannot perform his or her duties unless he or she is fine and fit. Smoking is one of the growing curse society. it has destroyed so many lives. It is very injurious to health. A smoker gets so many diseases at a time by using even a single piece of cigarette. A research has told us that a smoker can affect his or her surroundings more than his or her self. One of the component of a cigarette i.e. the can spoil the lungs user. Cigarette is declared totally carecinogenic. it can cause severe lungs cancer along with respiratory paralysis and other diseases. The habit of smoking is much more popular in youngsters. They take it as a joke but eventually evaded up with a habit. The company of our youngsters is responsible for the development of that habit. The research of who told that the percentage of smoking people is different for different wintriest. But in Pakistan it has reached to an alarming situation. The young generation of Pakistan is indulging in this bad habit. Different countries have taken different measures to avoid this situation. In china the Govt. ordered to kill all the people that are involved in smoking. Similarly all the other countries are also taking strict precautions to avoid this situation. Not only the young generation woman and man of different countries are also habitual to smoking. our Govt. is still not aware of the alarming situation. The Govt. should have to take strict measures to save Pakistan from this curse. new laws should be made and imposed to stop smoking. The young generation of every country is the builder of the nation. A nation cannot build strong enough unless her builders are strong. for making our builders our future leaders strong we should have to save them from this curse. Because among these people there is our Quaid_e_ azam and Allama Iqbal.,B1.2
"We have been college students. It seems that we are more relaxed than high school students because we have fewer lessons and we are more relaxed than people who have worked because we don't have to earn much money to support ourselves and our family. However, we are not relaxed as it seems to be. In fact, it is important for us to have a part-time job. Firstly, we indeed have more spare time than others. After class, we have a lot of time to learn by ourselves. But most of us spend much time in playing computer games or walking streets with no mind. It is better to find a part-time job during this time. Secondly, considering we need to gain social experiences before graduation and college life can't offer us many chances, we can do a part-time job to improve our social abilities. Thirdly, we can earn some money to reduce our parents' burden. Though most of parents ask us not to worry about the expenses in college, as a college student, we are old enough to do so and we are responsible to support ourselves even our parents. In addition, some students may come up with an idea of their future job. For example, many successful businessmen had their company when they were college students. As a college student, we should have a sense of responsibility for ourselves, our family and the society. We want a part-time job and it will benefit us.",B1.1
"Yes, I agree. Smoking has been proven to be detrimental to health. It potentially causes lung cancer, as well as more immediate and visible symptoms such as yellowing of one's teeth. Furthermore, second-hand smoking is worse for health --- these people are not used to the smoke, and this has been proven to be worse for their bodies. Singapore has taken many measures to limit smoking --- for one, they mark up the prices of cigarettes, such that it is very costly to maintain the habit of smoking, in an effort to deter people from smoking. For two, they print gory graphics on the cigarettes' boxes, to warn smokers of the harmful effects of smoking. For three, they have increased the ban of smoking in most places, limiting it to only open-area carparks, amongst other places. I feel that other countries should follow Singapore's lead, because this would be overall beneficial to the population. Firstly, the individuals are at lesser risk of the health side effects of smoking. Secondly, this would gradually lead to cleaner air --- smokers do not have to add to the already polluted air, caused by motor emissions. Thirdly, there would be less litter, because there would be less cigarette butts casually disposed off, by inconsiderate smokers. ",B1.2
"I disagree to the statement. Because for me students should be only be focus on their studies for them to gain knowledge in class discussion. I don't say that a job while studying is not good, but for me, if you can pursue your study even if you are not working then just go to school and study. I also think that being working student is one factor for them to have a hard time completing their stuffs in school like assignments, projects and the knowledge that has to be ready every day before going to school. Finding a job is not that hard if you finish your study should always be first for all the students out there. Well, let's say you have a job while studying, but what is the point of having a job if you are having a hard time in school that causes you to gain low grades? It is useless. My main point in this topic about the importance of part time job to college students is that students should always bear in their mind that education is very important especially it is one of the most-faced problem nowadays of the youth. Always remember that education is the key to success. 207",B1.2
" As we all know, smoking is becoming a widespread habit in the whole world today. We can see all kinds of people smoke on street or on bus or wherever they want. Some of them even smoke in restaurants. Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? I think the answer is yes. There is no doubt that smoking does harm to our health and we all know that smoking can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer. But why so many people still smoke like chimneys? The reason varies from person to person. Some people may think it cool with a cigarette between their lips. Some may smoke just out of curiosity. And some may smoke to refresh themselves. However, smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves but also a great threat to others. When we smoke in the restaurant, we unconsciously do harm to others at the same time. We should think for others so we shouldn't smoke in restaurant. On the other hand, when we eat in restaurant, we will feel awful if others are smoking. So we can't have a good mood to enjoy our meals. Imagine we are in a restaurant full of smokes, which must be very bad! And smoking at restaurant is often regarded as a bad manner. If we want to enjoy our meal, smoking must be banned! In a word, smoking does a lot of harm to smokers and non-smokers. It must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.1
"I Strongly agree, The smoking banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is one type of drug that is harmful to themselves and those around the body and Personality is not good. Smoking in restaurants is a very important social manners and into the restaurant all look forward to relaxing. But if there is cigarette smoke and smell. No relaxation will not feel uncomfortable to live the consequences is. Mental bad. Body is not strong. And stress. Restaurant as a place for relaxation, Most of the restaurant customers want convenience. Clean and safe. If the smoking freely in restaurants. Will damage the image of the restaurant. It is not attractive. The present this concept is very popular worldwide. But in the process successfully most countries are strong and growth. Because countries with strong and security. Will see the importance of people and self image in their countries. In Thailand, Help the campaign was successful only in part. Because the media campaign has limited and published less in Thailand. So we must help the campaign seriously. Safety for self and others And prosperity of the country. I will try to be a part of helping a non-smoking restaurant and not just in restaurants only but in Thailand, It must be non-smoking as well.",A2
"I think the part time job must need our current life. Because the part time job is very good experience before we have a job. During the part time job, we can learn communication skill as meet many different people and we know how money is important. However, I think that our purpose change to do the part time job. Recently, our purpose to do part time job is because of pay tuition. In the past, we experienced before we have a job. But recently we supply to pay tuition. By doing the part time job, we can know about notion of money and a way to treat people. The part time job help that we learn many things. For example, we can meet various people and we can learn responsibility for work. Also, it is perceived economic notion. I think the part time job is also a kind social life. We can get many things during the part time job. If we did it hard, we could get money that much. And we can meet many people during it. So it can be worth experience to us. So I think we experience the part time job before getting employment.",B1.1
"Now, there are many student of junior high school and senior high school are smoking. After school, they went to the restaurant or mall to smoking together with their friend. They look very happy. Usually they smoking and play card with their friend. They do that and do not know what is the effect of smoking for their health. Smoking is a bad for our health. It can cause many diseases, for example lungs throat, heart throat, impotency, and the other diseases. On the other hand, if we smoking we also addictive and we need some money to buy it. Bad cause of smoking not only for smoker, but passive smoker also get the effect. The smoke of cigarette is very dangerous. Because of it effect, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. If the restaurant allow the customer to smoking, they must provided a smoking room so not disturbing and give bad effect to the other customer. If they do not allow the customer so they must banned the customer for smoking so the smoke of cigarette not disturbing the other customer. Because a restaurant is a place for eat and not for smoke, so a restaurant must be free from people smoking.",B1.1
"As is known to us all, college is a place where people look for further education, exchange their academic ideas and finally both enrich their selves for their future career in society and propel the development of all endeavors of society. However, college is not equal to society. College students need opportunities to get in touch with those things beyond campus and accumulate enough practical experiences for their future careers. It is precisely the part-time job that gives such opportunities to college students. Serving in restaurants, working as an intern secretary for a company, or being a salesman selling commodities on short-term sale etc., no matter what part-time job a college student chooses to participate in, she will learn practical skills to adjust to society which academic-centered college cannot teach her. Besides, it should be taken into consideration that part-time jobs do offer a certain amount of money to college students, making some financial income for college students' daily life or even helping them to afford their college study. One of my high school classmates went to a college in Singapore for further education after his graduation, in the first year, his family offered his nearly $15, 000 for study and living expense. Now he is in his senior year, with his part-time job income of nearly $250 per month on average, he will save at least $2, 000 for his family when he get his bachelor degree. During the two years' part-time job, he not only gained money, but also learn things about making contract with a company, getting along with coworker, how a restaurant is arranged and run, etc. Hence, it is important to college students to have a part-time job.",A2
"I agree with the statement. Because I believe that college students should experience a lot of things. In order to live in this world, you need some ability. And it is experiences that give you them. Part-time job provide you with not only money but also experiences. For example, when you success in the job, you can get confidence. When you make some mistakes, you can have a chance getting any solutions. And they will be your skills to do well in this society in the future. Of course there are many things you cannot experience through part-time job. But you will earn money. You could do a lot of things as trip, studying abroad, shopping or love. Part-time job is just kill two birds with one stone. for college students because not only above reason but also you have time and you are free. That is to say you give time and freedom. Why? I believe that society give you the last chance to fly away into the severe world. So you should experience many things to do well in this society. This is important. And I think the best way is Part-time job. Therefore I agree with the statement.",A2
"Yes, I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking destroys the ambience of the restaurant and the dining experience. Imagine trying to enjoy a meal in a high-class and polished restaurant with cigarette smoke wafting all around. The image just does not match! Firstly the smell of cigarette smoke is unpleasant and this interferes with the diners' tasting of the food. As we all know, the senses of smell and taste are strongly linked together and one does not work as well without the other. This is the reason why we cannot seem to enjoy our food as much when our nose is blocked as we cannot smell the food. Similarly, since the smell of smoke overpowers the smell of food, diners will be unable to enjoy their food as much. Thus, if restaurants want to enhance the dining experience for the diners, they should ban smoking in their restaurants. Secondly, smoking is bad for health. Notwithstanding the personal health detriments that smoking brings, it also adversely affects the health of other people. This is not fair to the non-smokers because they did not choose to breathe in second-hand smoke. Allowing smoking also does not align with the image of health-conscious and organic restaurants. Thus, for the better health of the diners, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. ",B1.2
"Maybe it looks cool to have a cigarette. However, the fume from the cigarette is more harmful for others around you. I do agree to ban smoking at a public place, such as restaurant. Today, there are too many people in China smoking and too many people leading a bad life. When they have a cigarette, their lungs will become black. And when they have one more, it will be blacker. As a result, it will maybe cause them a pneumonia, or a more serious disease. However, maybe you do not know that people nearby a smoker will be affected more seriously. Fume form a lit cigarette has much more poisonous substance than that is insoaked in. So it should be banned smoking in a public place, where there are many people. Banning smoking can weaken pollution and make a stable and peaceful living environment. When we have a dinner in a smoking banned restaurant, we will feel good though then we will have no bad feeling, which is our want to have and appreciate. I do agree to ban smoking in a public place.",B1.1
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I agree with this statement. I think all of college students should experience a part-time job, at least once, during their school life, because through it, they can learn how hard to earn money is. ?Before I experience a part-time job, I got money from my parents. I spent it playing with my friends, eating fast foods, buying clothes etc. But I soon exhausted all money, because the amount of money which I could use per a month was limited by my mother. I irritated about that, and thought that why my mother doesn't give me more money? Then I entered *** University and started working as a part-timer (I work at a Japanese bar as a waitress), and knew how hard to earn money is. At workplace, I have to bear many painful duties. For example, I must keep smiling, must run, must take heavy dishes, must be kind to every customer, and sometime I'm scolded by my master. These make me very tired, but after enduring them, I can get money. In this way I really knew the value of money. We should not spend money without knowing how thankful thing money is. That's why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I agree with the statement to a large extent. Having a part-time job exposes college students to things they have not learned or will never learn in school. This is increasingly important as the working world now demands more than just academic understanding. Firstly, real life experiences play an equally important, if not more important role than academic studies. Having a part-time job allows college students to interact with people of different age as them, different profession and goals. As compared to interacting with their schoolmates, this is a newer form of interaction that requires a different set of skills. Secondly, while working on the job, they will face difficulties that they have not encountered before and hence they will be pressed to come up with solutions. This is an opportunity for them to apply what they have learned as well as to think out of the box and solve problems with novel solutions. Thirdly, students of this generation have led a relatively comfortable and pampered life. With a part-time job, they will understand the hardships of working and be more appreciative of their parents. Furthermore, they can learn to be more independent by earning money for their own needs and wants. However, part-time jobs should be carefully selected. Not all part-time jobs give the same benefits. Jobs that are illegal or dangerous should not be considered as it will produce net harm. In conclusion, if college students take on suitable part-time jobs, it can be a start to the journey of self-discovery and becoming more sensible. ",B1.2
"Smoking is harmful to everybody. Those who like to smoke will hurt their families, friends and someone surrounding them, because secondhand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, they would cause lung cancer and heart disease. But those who like to smoke are difficult to quit the bad habit. When they smoke in a public place, the people around them would feel uncomfortable, smoking affects their health. The government has smoking completely banned in all public places. 90% of people support it, but smokers say that the law would deprive their rights. Its a really difficult problem. Maybe smokers could think over quitting smoking, it would be salutary to themselves and their families or friends. I am not a smoker, and I think, it is essential that smoking should be completely banned in public. The law prevents others from secondhand smoke's harm. The amount of fumes others smell and breathe in from smokers is really annoying. Ban smoking in public places doesn't deprive smokers' rights. On the other side, it protects others' right. Smokers will still have the right to smoke in their private space. And non-smokers will be free to smoke in public place. Isn't it a wonderful law?",B1.2
"I really agree with this opinion. Maybe someone says it's a waste of time for the students, but I never think so. Because I regard it not as a way of getting money but as a sight of the society. I also have a part time job, then I found some good points of it. At first, it's so important to do what we've never done. The experience gives us new ideas. And I think young people can get more and better ideas from things. The dramatic change from receiver to server might give us some big discovery. Second, in near future we'll have a work anyway, so it becomes a good practice and a useful information for choosing a job. Take me for example, when I was a small childe I wanted to become a cook of cakes, then as I became a collage student I had a part time job of cake shop assistant. So I was glad (a part of) my dream came true, but in same time I knew the work is hard so much. And I though it's just good for me to be an assistant of cook. Third, working enable us to feel the relationship with the society keenly. When I was given a pay the first time in my life, I felt as if I was admitted from the society. And I realized I would soon become an adult. As long as we don't neglect study that is our main job, we could get the thing what is more than the pay from a part time job.",B1.1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. I have three ideas. First, a part time job's incomes enable us to live a rich life without parent's help. I think this thing leads us independence from parents or families. For example, my friend studies for future, of course using her income. Next, this experience becomes learning to orient the community, and we learn ability of cooperation. Now, I job at the bar. I made many friends there. They are my precious friends except job time. And I learn etiquette or correct tongue, too. And Thanks to this experience, I grow up my sense of responsibility. Last, there are many kinds of a part time job. For example, restaurant, tutor, lecturer of private school, and temporary employment agency's jobs, etc. So we have many choices. And we can select our favorite jobs. If we would get a job, we couldn't experience various jobs. If we job very hard, we might neglect college's study or club activity. This thing is very unhappy. So, I think it is important that we have to fulfill a duty, for example, college's study. But a part of job's experiences surely connect our future. Absolutely, this experience is very useful in the society. So, I think a part time job is important for college students.",B1.1
"Nowadays, Social around the world had a change. It made evolution such as technology, education, communication, culture, language, economic, social, etc. Education in Thailand was changed. In the past, A charges of education is low but now a charges of education is very high because have a tuition fees is very expensive. Then a cost of living is expensive too. A problem in the money for college students became important. Money received from family not inadequate for living. It made college students to have a part-time job for make money and reduce a problem in family and the important, make money for use in education and make living comfortable. I do agree to have a part-time job while being a college student. A part time job such as make in KFC, Swenzen, MK restaurant, Pizza Huts, 7 - 11, working in college, or employees serving food in the restaurants etc. A part time job will receive different money. Some where receive 25 bath/hour, some where receive 100 bath/day. However if college students to have a part time job every day and use a less money and save money, student college will have a lot of money and use life happily in the social.",B1.1
"I don't agree that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. There is no doubt that the purposes of doing a part-time job is earn working experience and earn money. However, having a part-time job can mean nothing to them as it is possible for them to learn nothing although they have a part-time job. Besides, if students have a part-time job, their performance in study may be affected if their time management is bad. Actually, being a university students, there are lots of important and meaningful things they can do instead of doing part-time job. Also, there is something which they can have chance to try in university only. Why don't spend this treasurable time to learn more, try more and also broaden horizons? For example, joining the exchange program can give university students a chance to travel to other countries in order to broaden their horizons. Joining the internship program can give university students a chance to work in specific company in order to gain specific working experience. Being a committee in one of the society can enrich their university life, enhance their communication skills and enlarge their networking. These are much more important than doing a part-time job as these experiences are useful and important for their future.",B1.1
"As far as I am concerned, it is very important for university students to have a part-time job. The reasons why I argue are as follow. In the first place, you can apply the knowledge you learnt in the classroom to practice if you have a part-time job. Secondly, it will be a good chance for you to improve your soft skills, such as communication skills and time management skills, when you do the part time job. This can, in return, enhance your study back at school. Absolutely, this will benefit you a lot when you really find a job after graduation. Besides, you can earn the allowance from the job, which will lighten the financial burden from your parents who support your study. What is more, gaining working experience while studying in university, you may find jobs after graduation more easily. Some people may disagree that they believe having part time jobs will result in worse academic performance at school. I think, however, this is not the case. Multi-tasking is what we definitely will encounter when we join the society after graduation. Instead of escaping from the challenge, it is better for us to practice as soon as possible.",B2
"Part time job is very interesting because that can help us use free time in the good way and can help us make more money to save it for use in the future. In each day there are 24 hours, but we not use it all. Everybody have a free time not same. If you have more free time you can use it to useful by do a part time job. Part time job very normally in the country in Europe because they want to practice a children to be adult. Part time job can help you can do a job by yourself and you can save money to use in other time, that can help you pound cause of you can find money by yourself and your parents will pound in yourself too. If you can do a lot of part time job it is very well because you can do many different thing. So part time job is the better way for teenager to do because it very useful and help you practice yourself to be a good person. Free time can be the best time if you can spend it with part time job because part time job not only a job but it is can help you can be a best one and that make you pound with yourself and also your parents.",B1.1
"I don't agree. I would add however, that it could be important but it really gets down to the individual concerned based on their needs, emotional maturity and general life experience levels. Having a part-time job while attempting to study a college degree on a full-time basis is not for everyone. In fact, I would venture to state that it could be detrimental for some more than others. While there are obvious benefits to be gained from working, the downside is that not everyone deals with pressure or stress in the same way. Placing too much pressure on oneself could quite possibly lead to dropping out, academic failure or quite literally traumatize students emotionally. This is not idle theory as there have been many examples that are a matter of public record which support my claims. I held a part-time position while I was at college and didn't encounter any difficulties which could not be easily overcome. I do recall quite clearly, that there were several students on campus who were not as blessed as I was and they experienced many, many problems which eventually led to them dropping out. So again I say, while it could be important to have a part-time job at college, it is subjective to the individual's personal circumstances.",C2
"Smoking is discouraged in many countries. Singapore is one such country. In Singapore, smokers are often discriminated. In many public places, smoking is simply banned or small areas are drawn up in the periphery for the smokers to congregate at. The price of cigarette is artificially increased by heavy government taxes on cigarettes. Socially, advertisements and education often paint smoking in a bad light and smokers are generally viewed unfavorably in the Singaporean society as a result. So why do people still smoke? I believe that apart from the conventional reason of addiction, there is another more important factor. After all, to put it crudely, if addiction is the one and only reason, after the current batch of smokers die, there should be no more smokers. I think that the other important factor is that smoking is generally viewed as a ""cool"" deviant act. The more the society and government persecutes smokers (short of totally banning smoking), the more smokers will be seen as deviants. People marginalized by society might therefore turn to smoking simply to find an identity. Otherwise, it could simply be because smoking is ""cool"". After all, everyone loves an underdog, and in this case, smokers form the class suppressed by the society and government. Think of original hippie fashion in this sense, it was a counter-culture developed by the marginalised portion of society that eventually developed into something mainstream. Since we must have some form of discrimination to discourage smoking, I feel that ironically, this is exactly why it is inevitable that we will always have smokers. People should therefore not place too much emphasis in eliminating the smoking problem and focus more on managing it. ",B2
"Smoking is injurious to health. It is caused by cigarette. But thing to know what is smoking cigarette is produced by dried leaves of tobacco and when the cigarette is burned the smoke is produced. Of course we know that smoking has no advantages it has adverse disadvantages and at the present age it is the more common in new generation. Some new generation is also consider it as a fashion. This is mostly spreading by the bad companies of friends. As we all know that one fish pollutes the whole river in the same way one friend due to his bad habit delivers its bad habits to his friends. Some young people are the only sole breeders of their family. The friends mostly gathers at the restaurants and do smoking. It smoke spread every where due to this smoke some people which do not take smoking also become ill, because it is medically prove that if the one person take smoking the other people sitting around him also become ill. So it is necessary to be banned in restaurant. It can cause series disease such as lung cancer. Our government should take accounts on this serious issue by launching seminars, through media giving the information to people and realize them that how cigarette is dangerous for life more over cigarette making companies should be banned to make their country free from cigarette smoking.",B1.2
"I largely agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As many of us may know, studying in a college or a university is very costly if without any scholarships or financial support. If college students does not get a job, this means that they can only get the money from their parents or get a loan. Some may argue that students should just focus on studying and not be obsessed about earning money at this point in time. I beg to differ. College students should get a part-time job as they can learn to be independent especially when they are of a young adult age. By getting a part-time job not only expands one's social circle, it also prepares them for whats coming after university, which is working life. Only by experiencing the difficulties and challenges of a work life, they can then understand the money they have earned was not so easy afterall and spend it thriftly. By just asking parents for money, they may not even know how hard it is to strive in a working life, until they experience it themselves. Thus, in conclusion, i find that it is important for college students to get a part-time job, however, if they are already struggling with balancing both studies and working, they should better manage their time and reduce a little on the working hours.

"Smoking is bad for health. Smoking causes lung cancer. Smoking causes heart disease. Of course I know that. As if the hearty, overzealous anti-smoking campaigns weren't doing enough to curb this unhealthy habit, they insidiously wove this schtick into the curriculum. Case in point: Biology class in Secondary 2. We learned how tiny smoke particles bind irreversibly with red and white blood cells, and are carried throughout the body, effectively spreading the harmful substances all over our body. Please, if I ever need a poignant reminder of aforementioned harmful effects, I would just buy a pack and stare at the tasteful illustrations of gangrenous tissue ravaged by years and years of chain smoking. But wait, what is inside the box- holy sh*t! Aha, what a shame it would be to see these twenty perfectly new and viable cigarettes go to waste. You see, no one talks about the other side effect of smoking. You feel good. No, I correct myself, you feel bloody good. It was as if a low rumble of euphoria washed over your entire being, not unlike the high from alcohol, except slower. It is also a great tool for socialization. Imagine petty little deviants like me all congregating in those stupid yellow boxes, packed like sardines, puffing away. Yup, the government has made it illegal to smoke freely in public places, except for those tiny yellow boxes demarcated ""smoking corners"". What the f*ck. As if we have no rights to speak of.

If there many man use the cigarette in general place, it has contribute the bad things about the air pollution and dirty situation. Such as in the restaurant, it's should be clean place and free from the smoking because that place is used for the people to enjoy the comfortable eat. Restaurants is a place to had by many people to rest and refresh the body with fill up the stomach with some food to get much power for do their activity, so there are not too good if they eat with around the smoker who can decrease the quality of their food.

"A student is like an insurance of any thing for country, is should be maintained with attention, firstly it takes from our side but it returns by doubling it up when there are no other sources remained. If we do not care about our precious things, we do not provide them appropriate service these are spoiled & depreciated before the time. Same like with students because they are the Future falcons of a country. We can say that a student's life is the busiest age of his whole life because he learns new things everyday, every hour and every minute. While in practical life he implements these learning to get benefit and to be succeeded in every field of life. Proper environment, able teachers and opportunities to progress are the basic needs of a student. These needs are attained by only few lucky students because these are being costly like every other thing in this country. Government institutes are unable to provide these things because of bribery, corruption, carelessness and such other evils. Blockage of opportunities and limited resources are causing inflation. Income of a common man is same but expenditures are doubling up. The rates of books, notebooks and most importantly fees are going out of hands of even a middle class person. Except these unachievable expenses many of youngsters are so that they are in the age of study but they have to feed their family also, they have to fulfill their educational dues as well as household expenses. That's a tough task and not everyone is capable of such strong responsibility. Although student has a busy life and faces many tough tasks to be successive in his educational field in such a competitive age However, he has to perform a part time job as well because the present situations require it; otherwise he may have to leave his studies when there would be no resources left.",B1.2

"It's quite normal for college students to take one or more part time job when they are on campus. It is a way for them to earn some extra pocket money and buy something that they want but can't get money from parents. There are various kinds of part time jobs available to college students invilving washing dishes at restaurants, being waiters or waitresses, tutors and some even can programme for software companies if they know how to write programmes. Despite all these advantages some consider it to be a time-comsuming thing for college students who also have a great deal of courses to take. They reckon that the time we trade for money now is far less important than the time should be spent on study thus resulting in a better job in the future which means more money earned. For those who take part time jobs at college, they think that the experence of taking part time jobs is a valubale advantage over those who do not have the experence of working with peaple, experencing what it really feels to deal with the stress at work or with colleagues. Here comes the comclusion, taking part time job means extra money and experence of working but less study time. So, if your courses allows you to spair some time to take a part time job, my advice is that why no give it a try.",B1.1
"The reality of life usually starts when one is already working. Eyes are opened to the ugly truth which pertains to the life which is really simple but people are making it complicated. People are so busy. You sleep late. You get up early. You get broke. You can't really depend on someone all the time. I believe that some college students have been already realizing about the reality of life though, since some already have a part time job. In my opinion, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job. Every step that we take prepares us for the following big step. Being a college student as well, I believe that we must be preparing for more pressuring toils that we have to withstand in the future. Not to mention the sleepless nights because of the overload of home works, a part time job would be really a part of the training. People look at this situation at different perspectives. Most look it as a way to earn money to spend for shopping or for other desired wants. Some think of it as a way for starting an investment for their future. While a few view it as a way to train their selves in preparation for the real world.",B1.2
"I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. When someone is allowed in a restaurant, other non smokers' rights are hurt. Someone might claim that smoker has the same right to smoke as the nonsmoker has the right to do not smoke, but someone's right can be justified when it doesn't hurt another's right. It means that someone's right is confined until it doesn't intrude another's right. In these days, the restaurants usually divide the sections, one section for smokers and the other for nonsmokers. However, although they divide the sections, the smokes are easily escaped from the smoking area to nonsmoking area. It really bothers to the nonsmokers who don't want any smokes while eating their foods. Yesterday I went to the Seoul National University subway station to eat dinner with my boyfriend and we decided to eat chicken. We got into the restaurant and started to eat dinner, and suddenly I smelled smokes. Looking around, I found the guys next our table smoked, and then I was really annoyed from that moment. The chickens suddenly seem not delicious, and I just felt I wanted to go out there. In my opinion, there might be lots of people who experienced unhappy mood during the eating because of the smokers in the same restaurant. Therefore I would be grateful if the all the restaurant in the country completely ban the smoking.",B2
"I agree with this statement. There are three reasons why I think it is important. First of all, through a part time job we can experience and learn many things which we can not in our school life. When we graduate the college and get a job, the experiences is very important. Second, we can really learn the importance of money. Almost all of us have lived using money which our parents had earned. We might take it granted that we have money and can use it. We know getting money is very difficult. However we don't know how difficult it is in real sense. We can not learn the difficulty until we have a part time job. When we experience the difficulty, we know the importance of money for the first time, and we begin to thank our parents. Third, college students have many free times. Of course studying is the most important section of students. However, I realized the fact; even if, we study very hard, we have more free times than when we were high school students. Now, I don't have any part time jobs. When the classes are end, I don't have what to do, and go karaoke, boring or so on. As the result money disappears from my wallet. If I have a part time job, I get money and I don't have any times to use money. It is just like killing two birds with one stone.",A2
"In nowadays, because the fast living pace, and the requests of high standard of living, some bad habits become the way to release the pressure that result from pursuing these things. Smoking is one of them, and it is also the normal one. But, I think smoking is not a good habit for people to maintain it, no matter to ones or even the others health, and especially in the public place. Smoking affects not only the smokers' health, but also the people around. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places, especially in the restaurants. Every human being who stays in the restaurants, they have the right to ask for the better surrounding. The customers pay for dinner, so they have the right to possess and pursue the best surrounding. Smoking always affects the atmosphere, mood and also the health of the people in the restaurants. To bear the mind in the interest of health of whole people and also it is the best way for some people who addicts to smoke to quit this bad habit. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and also the public place in the country. Generally speaking, health is better than wealth.",B1.2
"Okay, now i want to write down an essay about part time job. But first, i have to tell you that my english is very bad. So, im sorry if i confused you with my word. :D Part time job is a good way to train our children because i think that studies theory in school is not enough. They must have more experience before we release them to world of work. Parents must know that doing part time job have many advantage to their children. First, they will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship besides teacher and classmates. Second, they will more easily to find their ideal job because of their experience. Third, part time job can train them how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money, so they can more appreciate money and not carelessly spend it. Fourth, It will increase their ability to speak to public (public relation). Interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. Fifth, they can learn how to take responsibility for what they have done. Take responsibility is very important factor in our working environment too. Another reason for the urge of encouraging our children to take part time job is part time job can make them know what is the value of time. Many children spend their idle time to playing video games, computer, watch movies, etc.. With doing part time job, they can use that time to do something meaningful things. In summary, we can say that part time job is good for our children.",B1.2
"I will explain about part time job's requirement. I think that we must experience a part time job. There are five reasons of my opinion. First, we will go to company after graduation. The company demands various experience because the company wants to a man with a varied career. The companies don't like a beginner. Because they don't know about an applicant's ability. Second, a part time job gives a social nature to part timer. Because when a part timer works in work place, he meets many people. He experiences many situations. Third, we can make money. A part timer gets paid for his labor. Forth, we have a lot of job for a while. We have many different jobs so, we experience various lives. After part time job, we can have a big dream and realize a dream. Fifth, we can live productive life. And we can have positive thinking. So we will live a good life.

" Since the discovery of tobacco, smoking has been popular worldwide. In the new century, the number of smokers has been increasing rapidly. As a result, many smokers have got diseases which they suffer from a lot. To prevent the bad effects caused by smoking, I think it is important to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. For one thing, smoking can bring diseases to both smokers and people around them. Most smokers hooked by cigarettes cannot be as fashionable as the stars, but they may get lung diseases like pneumonia, even lung cancer. According to modern medical science, smoking is also linked to heart disease and bronchitis. It is reported that smoking is responsible for millions of death around the world every year. A restaurant is a serving place. It's illegal to harm other people's health there. For another, smoking is just a waste of time. People might smoke because they feel confused or annoyed. However, one can never solve his problems by smoking. If people in a restaurant spend the time considering the situations instead of smoking, they may come up with methods to solving their problems. Besides, smoking pollutes the air. Not all the people can bear having a delicious meal in a restaurant full of smoke. Smoking is bad for the elevation of a country's image in the world. To sum up, I insist that banning smoking be completely at all the restaurants in the country is necessary. Only in this way can people become healthier and happier.",B1.2
"Loads of advertisements or researches have stated that smoking is harmful to our body. Still, there are numbers of people all over the world have this bad habit. A majority of smokers started smoking even when they were young. What are the reasons behind? People start smoking due to a variety of reasons; major reasons are peer pressure, problems in relationship between family member or friends and heavy stressful workload. Firstly, friendship is extremely important for teenagers. They will imitate what their peers do to show and prove themselves to be friends of each other. As teenagers believed that smoking is a sign of trendy and mature, they are eager to purchase cigarettes and smoke. As a result, groups of teenagers begin to smoke under peer pressure. Secondly, conflicts may occur among family members or friends. Together with the heavy and stressful workload, people will relieve their stress with smoking. Cigarettes contains clove, making the mouth and lungs of smokers paralyzed, resulting in a slight pleasure. People smoke as they want to evade from the problems they faced. What make worse is that the major and active component of cigarettes is Nicotine. Nicotine can lead to addition of smoking so there is an increase in number of smokers. There is a number of studies show that tobacco harm the human body no less than drugs. Hence, many countries and organizations has started the promotion of smoking cessation.",B1.1
" Nowadays it is common to see that more and more college students take a part-time job in their spare time. At the same time, it causes people from all walks of life to heatedly debate over whether the phenomenon is a blessing or a curse. However, in my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job for three reason. To begin with, it is a good method to accumulate the work experience in order to prepare for job-hunting after graduation. In the contemporary university, many students are grumbling that they are lack of the opportunity of practical work. Therefore, they take a part-time job and seize the chance to know more about how the company works and how to survive harsh competitions. During the work they confront a great number of challenges and their abilities will be improved. Moreover, part-time jobs can alleviate financial burdens on parents and promote them to manage the money. Currently it is inevitable for students to spend money in many ways to keep daily life and they also don't want to aggravate the burden on their parents, so they get the pays through part-time jobs. Additionally, they come to learn to balance income and expenses by themselves. In addition, many students can apply knowledge to practice through part-time job. For example, some students majoring in Japanese tend to seek the work related to Japanese, such as Japanese tutors, Japanese interpreters. It is a good chance for them to challenge and make further progress. Based on the three forceful reason, I believe part-time job is important for college students. Although it brings a lot of benefits, I still suggest that college students should balance study time and work time.",B1.2
"I disagree because college is a lot more difficult than people realize and to graduate is even more difficult than it was just a few short years ago. If students are working in part-time jobs because they need to survive or pay college fees, then that's understandable. If there is no need to pay, then I would say don't work because college is hard enough as it is without adding impossible schedules, heavy workloads or other obligations that only serve to suck up more and more of your time and give you a bucketful of stress. So many of my buddies have held down jobs while attending college and all of them have their own little horror stories to tell. College is a big enough undertaking on its own these days and the pressure to graduate is always on. Leave well enough alone I think and just keep concentrating on your college stuff without adding to it. It's not compulsory unless as I said, you need the money or it might be a short internship which is a different story because you usually do those during your vacation times and they are not some extra curricular activity that sucks up your time and patience.",C2
"To all the people smoking in public places damage. No smoking peoples of tobacco smoke and passive smoking are to give It's very bad for people who smoke more than 10 times higher should.

Children are growing rice meokeultego be heard because a lady than adults will only make it worse. So smoke cigarettes in public places have to think very large fines. And manners to keep it for granted I think that it is. Public places smoke damage over those who do not have laws to go So if lesson is illegal and people are not self-restraint will ease us all. Therefore, we should raise the young people and smoking habits As adults to quit smoking should be When I was a bright face to national And these days, even elementary school children are blooming world. Starting with this, adults in the show to break the world I want to create smoke-free world. So politicians and public awareness and to create separate smoking areas and other places give a penalty should not give no smoking people damage. No smoking please",B1.2
"In my opinion smoking must completely banned from our society not only banned it at the restaurants. Everybody knows that smoking is not just harmful only the person who smokes, it harms other people around him, too caused of the smoke from his cigarette. When someone smokes, people around him will disgust and escape from him. Especially in the restaurants, smoking may expel the customers. Although some restaurants prepare smoking area for the clients, there is still bad atmosphere there. I think they should use the smoking area for doing anything is more useful than just smoking. Completely banned smoking at the restaurants, there are more advantages than disadvantages. The restaurants that banned smoking will be more acceptable than other restaurants that allowed smoking. I think all restaurants should campaign people to quit smoking and show how dangerous effect from smoking, may be by using advertisement on the board of their restaurants. When the restaurants have no smokers, customers will increase than before, the atmosphere of the restaurants will be fresh and they can make more incomes, too. So, all the restaurants must completely banned smoking, to make the clients feel happy and enjoy with the service form the restaurants. The restaurants that can do like this, will be the awesome restaurants for sure.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement, it's essential that college students have a part-time job. I have two reasons why I support that statement. First, College student learn that money is important and hard to make from experiencing their part-time jobs. Before going to college, in Korean situation, many students might have never earned money. Most of them may not have certain concept about money. Making money by themselves lets them think about what money is and how they spend the money economically. It helps them to build the concept of economics and to learn how important money is. Second, Part-time job is important in that it give the students chances of experiencing society in advance. Before becoming a member of society, they can learn what society is like and how they handle some problems from their part-time jobs. In my case, I had been serving at a restaurant for 6months. From the experience, I've learned that I should behave and talk nicely to my boss although I don't feel like doing it. Also there wasn't an excuse for my mistake even if it's not all my fault. Having a part-time job is very helpful to college student in that that experience makes them shape their economic standard and concept. It helps also them experience society before being a member of a society.",B2
"In the recent years, having a part-time job for a college student is nothing but normal, more and more college students choose to have a part-time job which is relative to their interest. Why is it? It's because there are a lot of benefits to have a part-time job. First of all, having a part-time job makes you learn more social experiences and skills, such as how to bargain with the customer, and how to sell efficiently. Besides, having a part-time job can help you have more responsibility, which is very important for a teenager who is going to become an adult. Second, you will know some people while doing part-time job, he/she probably is younger than you or older, no matter what, and it can improve your interpersonal relationship. If you are lucky, maybe you will meet a close friend, or the chosen one. Third, having a part-time job represents that you will have some income, you can buy whatever you want with the money earned by yourself. It's always happier to spend the money exchanged by sweat. In short, having a part-time job is going to make your life in school more different, it helps you become more confident and learn a lot!",B1.1
" I disagree with the statement. I believe that everyone in Singapore has a right to do what they want, including smoking in restaurants. Such a phenomenon is uncommon in Singapore and it is a harsh statement. Smoking is harmful to one's health and the government has stepped up measures to curb the problem of inhaling in too much second hand smoke in public places. Furthermore, it would be difficult to enforce the rule of completely banning smoking at all restaurants. There would surely have those that will find ways and means to bend the rules. On the bright side, I observed that customers in the restaurant usually have the habit of going outside the restaurant to have a puff too. Thus the smell of the smoke is un-noticeable in restaurants usually. It would be good if smoking can be banned in restaurants in Singapore, as it would mean a better dining environment for all of the customers in the restaurant itself, and everyone can have a meal with a piece of mind, without worrying about second hand smoke. If there is such a ban I believe that it would quite a long time for its full effects to completely materialise. 200 words ",B1.2

CafÃ© divide place smoking area or nonsmoking area. They ask to customer which area does you want. Unfortunately, I heard on TV that poorer nation, more smoking. This year, cigarette cost increase.

Smoking directly from the filter at least once every other bad substance out, but second-hand smoke as a bad substance. Today, many people who smoke worldwide. According to many studies, cigarette, causing a fatal disease, but many people puffing cigarettes is gradually increasing. So, smoking in public places, it's why you need to create space. Galicia In other words, I oppose smoking in public places. Second, smoking in public places, even to second-hand smoke need space. The right one smokes anywhere, but the damage caused by secondhand smoke not think we should not be wearing. Smoking in public places, so I think that there must be space. In other words, no smoking in public places is unfair. If you ban smoking in public places, their rights are ignored.

I have listened the word is ""Smoking are smart"" from many smokers but, in my opinion, it isn't smart and it annoy to other people. When smokers go to the restaurants where have many people are eating foods. If smokers smoking in the restaurants, they must to banned and must to get out from restaurants. Because they make bad pollution to other people. Besides, healthy of smokers are damages, healthy of other people around smokers are damages too. And smoking give many disadvantages to other people.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Nowadays, more restaurants in Japan separate nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. However, nonsmoking seats often become full soon and people who don't smoke have to sit smoking seats. I hate smoke of cigarette. It smells bad and penetrates into clothes. In addition, it makes me have a sore throat. For instance, guess that you have a dinner with your family cheerfully. On that time, if a man who smokes next to your table, smell of cigarette will spoil your delicious dishes and make you feel unpleasant. When I see a man smoking in a public place, I get angry very much. Smoking, of course, makes smokers unhealthy. Moreover, smoke of cigarette has a bad influence on people who don't smoke. Smoking makes a possibility of getting cancer high. There may be a pregnant mother or a baby in a restaurant. And so if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, people who dislike a cigarette can enjoy themselves without being irritated about other's smoke. What is more, smokers have less opportunities of smoking and so, they can become healthy. I hope smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country soon.",B1.1
"I agree with the idea that many college students should have a part-time job, but I think it is up to the students to decide for themselves if they will have enough time to fit this into their schedule so that they can still balance their class work and socialize in order to have the best college experience possible. Many students are too busy to have a part-time job, and such a student would be well advised not to place extra stress on themselves by finding a part-time job. On the other hand, a student who has enough time to have a part-time job may enjoy the extra benefits having part-time work can bring such as developing professional contacts and expanding your network of future colleagues. Next, it would be interesting to see if there have been any studies upon how many hours they student can work before they begin to negatively affect their performance in school. I guess that somewhere around 20 hours which is the upper limit for part-time work, students would begin to feel like they have no choice but to not do some of their schoolwork so that they can complete all of their work tasks. As long as they can say under this upper limit, they can probably balance everything they need to balance, and they will be better off for learning how to do that.",C2

College student is a person who have 16-20 years old. In this period student can does many work and can get money in free time from study. In the USA, college student must leave out from their home and they must help themselves in everything. Their parents will only support and suggest in their work. When they don't have parents they don't have money too. The part-time job is the best way for them. When they have a part-time job they will have a new experience.

The part-time job give for college student and another person both the money and experience. But in the Thailand, there is very different. When student have 16-20 years old, their parents will suggest to them for only study. Thailand college student must only study and shouldn't think in another topic This reason, Thai students don't have ability in use the life in social because they never do any thing in this period. It's have very disadvantages for them in the future. The part-time job is one way for college student to make a new and have money.

"Part time job is an investible part in my college days. Since I studied in University, I have taken many kinds of jobs during the college days. From waitress to tutor, there are so many jobs I have done that sometimes I couldn't remember all of them. For me, there are some reasons why I took so many part time jobs and what part time jobs mean for me. First, I have to earn my own livings. Since my families don't have the ability to support all of my life expenses, I have to make some money to support my own life. Therefore, I took many jobs to earn enough money for life. Second, I can have different experiences and learn some things from them by taking different jobs. Since I have done many kinds of jobs, I have learned different experiences from them. For example, I learned how to cope with my tutor students and the teaching skills in the tutor jobs. In addition, I also learned how to treat customers in a suitable way when I was a waitress. These experiences are really meaningful for me. The last reason is that I can make different kinds of friends from different jobs. And it's really interesting to have some chats during the working time. Part time jobs take a great part of my college life. Though I feel tired or frustrated because of them, I can't confess that I do learn a lot and get mature from these experiences. Therefore, I really can't imagine if I haven't done any part time job, what my college life will be.",B2
"Yes, I think the government should ban smoking at all restaurants in the country. Because, smoking is not good for customers, and that is not good for employees as well. Cigarette smoke may interfere with the convenience of those who do not smoke. It is also very repulsive to other people who are closed by the smoker. Cigarette smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanade, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart desease, and respiratory problems. The greatest risk in passive smokers, because they are most widely smoke inhalation rather than the smoker. Non smokers should not be subject to such a disgusting habit, because this is very dangerous as like explained above. Want to ban smooking in public places especially in the restaurant is not about depriving the rights of the smoker. Smoker will still have the right to smoke in their own space. The right to harm another person slowly and delibrately never be perceived of us. The smoker should have more respect for people who do not smoke, I guess. So, smoke from cigarettes smoked by the smokers is not inhaled by non smokers. We have to keep healthy each other, I guess.",B1.2
"I think it's very important for college students to have a part-time job. College is a totally different stage from junior and senior, because college students have more time to arrange and have to take full responsibility for their jobs. If college students can have a part-time job during their students' life, they can have a contact with the society, know the need of the job and learn some work skills before they step into region of job. This experience may help them find their jobs more smoothly after graduation. For example, if I major in accounting, I would try to have a part-time job in account office. It could make me realize what the ability I should have, and I can use the chance to know the whole system of account office. Another reason for getting a part-time job in college's life is money. Many college students should go to other county for studying and their parents may not give them money. So they have to find methods to earn money. Some college students use their knowledge and skills to make money.

College students can arrange their time wisely, and I think having a part-time job is also important.",B1.2
"Part time Job is quite fun to be engaged in. Most of the students, love to do work after or before they class because they have to earn money for their studies. Through part time job they get their money that would fill in their needs, wants and experiences. It is important for someone to have a working experiences because it's a sign of independency and it can actually lead us to become a mature and skilful person. But before applying for a Part time Job we have to consider some stuff. First, do we really have to get a part time job? Second, How much money I can make for this job? Is it really worth it? Third, do I really have enough time to accomplish this job? and Fourth, Am I ready for this? Those are the things you have to consider before getting a part time job. If you can't get a part time job because you think you're not that ready but you still have to support your studies, you can actually have a side lines. Side lines like Tutoring other students in Math, English or Science (whatever is your specialty), Baby sitting you neighbour's kids, Doing School Projects, Typing Jobs etc.",B1.2
"I worked as a part time tutor after finishing national service. At first I had trouble getting back into the hang of academic subjects, as I had basically spent two years in my camouflage uniform and looking at guns all day. I also felt a little frustrated, as I had already mastered these two subjects, namely Mathematics and Chemistry, back in my junior college years, and I could not understand why all my knowledge had basically disappeared in the short span of two years. So in addition to my monetary income, I had another reason to pick up my lost skills again, as I had to prove to myself that I did have the concepts contained in those two subjects within my reach. In addition, I had the chance to reinforce those concepts in the process, as by teaching my student verbally, I was rehearsing my knowledge of the subject matter and solidifying my grasp of said concepts. Altogether I had a very enriching experience being a private tutor, as I loved learning and academia in general, and in the process I developed important interpersonal communication skills, for example being articulate and patient. Of course, having a stable source of income did not hurt either. ",B1.2
" Not only men but also women smoke around the world. However, there is one thing that deserves us discussing, if smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. in my opinion it is a good chose to ban smoking in all restaurants. To start with, restaurants are the places for people to eat food. If you smoke, it will not only pollute the environment but also does harm to other people's health. Because we all know there are many diseases linked with smoking. for example people who smoke are easier to have cancer than others who do not smoke, so smoking in public is not polite even unequal to other person. what's worse, smoking is unsafe. Building a restaurant needs a lot of money, just a cigarette may cause a fire which will destroy the whole restaurant. In a word, as far as I am concerned, it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants in the country. We can image if there were no smoking in all the restaurants what our environment will become and may be people can live longer than when smoking is not limited in public. Considering all the aspects, banning smoking does brings no harm to anything around us but good.",B1.1
"Based on my opinion in Indonesia about the importance for students to work part-time Students have to learn because their parents are still responsible but they have different reasons Part time job could become an example of experience working on a part time job for students as students are less able to increase tuition fees and help the economy of such parents in Indonesia large number of unemployed and students can understand all because students can get the experience that a lot of examples for students working part-time advantage is to seek responsibility, adds to the cost of school, set the time management, until he could learn to adults and other whereas the impact of part-time work can interfere with him in time to learn, maybe a lot of tasks and the existence of extra-curricular My solution on a part time job for students should not be used, because he has the task to finish its work as a student and concentration with a lesson without thinking about work, because if he can finish his job as a student he can perform the following tasks and concentrate on the job will be undertaken after completing his duties as a student and also students can feel how wonderful the good times as a student.",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my answer. First, I think we don't need to smoke in a restaurant, because we go to there to enjoy good dishes not to smoke. Our purpose is not smoking. Second, I'd like to say that we can't enjoy tastes of dishes when we smoke, because smoke taste is really stronger than dishes. I think we can't have a good lunch or dinner even we go to a restaurant to enjoy dishes. Third, smoke is not good for health of the non-smoke people who come to a restaurant. Non-smoke people must breathe smoke when someone smokes in a restaurant even if non-smoke people don't hope it. Non-smoke people must lose their chances to have a good lunch or dinner because of smoking. And smoke is not good for our health and taste of dishes, especially for children of growing up. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Because we don't go to a restaurant to smoke, we can't enjoy dishes when smoke and smoke is not good health of non-smoke people especially for children.",A2
"Smoking is an activity that should be banned in all public areas, including restaurant. I need to say this statement because I have already felt a lot of negative effects when I was in the same place with people who smoking. In closed rooms, this problem will become even worse; the smoke from cigar will keep circulating in that room and inhaled by others. And if there is a food like in the restaurant, food will be contaminated by ashes and go into human body as well. For these problems, it obviously affects person's health. Smokes and ashes that enter human body will slowly damage respiratory and digestive systems. If this person is exposed to these smokes for a long period, eventually, he may get some kind of cancer. The other reasons why smoking need to banned is the inconvenience caused by this activity. Not all people like the smell of the cigarettes' smoke, even some people will cough heavily or get asthma when they inhaled too much smokes. In public areas, such as bus stop or toilet, we still can avoid these smokers by moving away from them. But in restaurant, we can't just leave our foods and go out from the restaurant. Tell the smokers to stop is also not easy to perform. So, the best way is from the officers in the restaurant to stick a non-smoking sticker at the front door.",B1.2
"Nowadays it is a common for college students to have a part-time job. Some students work part-time to pay their own tuition because their family cannot afford it. The others may just earn more pocket money for entertainment. But there are arguments whether it is appropriate for college students to have a part-time job. The opponent worry that part-time job would interfere the study. However, as far as I am concerned, having a part-time job is good for students' work career. The reason why I think having a part-time job is good for students' career are following. First, under the educational system of Taiwan, every student study hard and learn a lot of professional knowledge. But the shortage is that our students lack of team spirit because they studied alone throughout their learning career. By having a part-time job, they can learn to cooperate with people from different department or people in different age. University does not teach this, but it does important and helpful when taking a job. Furthermore, book and teacher offer knowledge while the society offers real experience. The school life is quite different from the real world. It is a good opportunity for students to previously get some realistic experience in taking a job. They may learn to be polite, humble, correct attitude and the most important, the better way to solve unpredictable problems. Last but not least, students will exactly realize the difficulty of earning money, which makes them more grateful toward what they've own. Although it is important for students to study their professional majors, but it is also important to plan their future. As a student, I think learning is not only in books, but also in real life. After all, we live in the real word, not in the knowledge.",B1.2
"I think that I would agree but unless students get a reasonable wage from their part-time job, it may not be enough and it could very well be necessary to have 2 or more jobs just to make ends meet. In New Zealand, many students are struggling on the meagre earnings that they are currently earning and it is nigh on impossible for them to pay any education fees and have money to live on as well. Many receive no funding from their families at all and if they don't have a job, they may be entitled to some government assistance but even then, it is not enough. It is very difficult for them to study and try to survive if they are the only breadwinner and the drop-out rate has been climbing steadily. I believe that the governmental needs to provide greater support for those students whether that would be by some form of increased stimulus package or monetary payments, I don't know. What I do know is that they need to act fast before the situation gets even more out of hand than it already is. Clearly, these kids want to study but they need to be able to live as well and all they really asking for is just hand up not a handout.",C2
"When I, non smoker, am eating food in a restaurant, some smokers annoyed my meal. Smell, and smoke from smoking was difficult for non smoker to keep eating food. Many restaurants have a separate place for smokers but smell and smoke still influence on other people's eating. Also, if smokers eat food in a separate place, they are directly exposed to smoke, so it is very harmful to them. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants. Also, smoking is not limited problem to eating. It is bad for people. However, if restaurants accept people to smoke, the reason why smokers should stop smoking is reduced. For example, In Singapore, it is banned to smoke in any street. After making this policy, the number of smokers reduced. Like Singapore, if it is banned to smoke in public places, the number of smokers will be reduced. Therefore, to ban smoking in restaurants have effects on reducing smokers. Especially, restaurants are important place to be cleaned. A little amount of dust or ash should not be discovered in any restaurant. However, if restaurants accept smoking there, the ash will spread in the place, so this is bad for hygiene of a restaurant.",B2

"I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. I think there are some reasons. First, it goes without saying that the main reason is to earn money. College students need some money for meals and clothes and so on. So we should have a part time job. Second, we can have many good experiences by having a part time job. For example, we can learn what a job is like and how severe a job is through a part time job. And we can also learn manners in the society. These experiences will be very useful when we get a job. Third, we can get on good terms with colleagues. There are many college students who have a part time job. So we can make friends with other college students. If we don't have a part time job, we can only make the same college students. So it is very good thing to have a part time job. These are the reasons why college students should have a part time job. College students have so much time, so they should use their time efficiently. I think a part time job is one of the best ways to use their time efficiently.",B1.1
" China has a large number of smokers. Many young boys and girls have the habit of smoking; some of them are middle school students. Even plenty of smokers have stepped into the restaurants. Most of nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon and the same to me. I hold the view that smoking should be banned especial at the restaurants. I clearly know that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to our health More and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. Admittedly, the smokers want to eliminate their pressure and relax themselves. Hanging a cigarette at the corner of the mouth makes them feel right and sure. The key to issues is they should not hurt other's feeling, while smokers should not pollute the clean air at the restaurants and do harm to others. Second-hand smoke is almost as medically hazardous to exposed non-smokers as it is to the smoker. All in all, I strongly advocate banning smoking in public. Not only is it good for the smokers themselves but also do their great contribution to our human being and our green world.",B1.1
"I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job has many advantages. First, it can provide college students a chance to get the working experience before they graduate from colleges. In that way, they can successfully apply a good job in the future. They also can learn how to communicate with different people in the society. Because campus is as small as it is compared with society. Not everyone is polite and friendly to you. Second, having a part-time job can make students know how difficult life is. Life is not easy, and making money is also a hard job. Therefore, they would not waste money and time. They would understand how great their parents are. Third, as an adult, it's our duty to earn money ourselves instead of getting money from our parents. We are no longer a minor; we have the ability to get a part-time job. So why don't you have a try to get a part-time job and buy everything you want Fourth, if you get a part-time job when you are a college student, I'm sure your college life would be more interesting and wonderful because you are busier than other students.

" As we all known, the argument against smoking become normal. Nowadays smoking has been shown to be dangerous to our health, living environment as well as our life quality. From the survey about smoking in 2002, it's said that the number of smoker in China reached 13 hundred million, which took up a large number of the population. What's more, recent research has shown that non-smokers can 30 percent of smokers all over the world, suffer health problem if they spend long period of time with people who do smoke. So, people who smoke in the restaurants will do harm to people who are non-smokers around them. Those non-smokers all hate it. However, smoking undoubtedly helps many people to relax, especially when they are relaxing with friends in the restaurant. Though smoking does lots of harm, somebody would also argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. In my opinion, people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smoker but surely they should be free to smoke where it is suitable. I suggest that public place like restaurant should seta special room for smoker to enjoy their ""bad habits at will.",B1.1

"About this topic, I think that it is not very important for college students to do part-time job. As we know, more college students tend to do a part-time job. Someone even has two or three. Though every coin has two sides, I believe that disadvantages of doing a part-time job outweigh its advantages. Some people guess that doing a part-time job can acquire many benefits, such as income, living experiments, etc. However, it pays us a large quantity of time and energy for the jobs. Doing jobs must be tired; it is not good for our health. In addition, colleges are the place where we learn knowledge. People usually believe that studying is the main task to students but not earning money. I really agree with it. Last but not least, doing part-time job can not earn a large number of money. Nevertheless, it cannot deny that we may be succeeding with lots of income in the future. Thus, knowledge plays an important role in our life. From what has been mentioned above, we can easily come to the conclusion that do part-time job is not a good choice to college students. We should focus more on study now.",A2

The most often place that they smoking and the most annoying too is at restaurant. Because when we eating we will disturbed by their smoke everywhere. Because of that smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country. Smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country not only because of their smoke that fly everywhere. Even there is a smoking area, it still annoying too cause sometimes restaurant put the smoking place and no smoking place too near. So sometimes we still can see the smoke, even we don't see the the smoke, it still can be dangerous because it's viruses still there and can in to other people body and damage their lungs or their other organs.

"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion a part time job in a college is very important for me because money from my mother, father or my aunt is not enough. There are many things I want to buy not only for my education in university degree but other thing also such as hanging out with my best friend, buy cosmetics, or shopping on my weekend because I want to be a fashionable. When your friend can buy everything that them want surely you are envy immediately, but you cannot do that. Why not? Because you are poor. So you find every way to have more money and part time job is one of your choices. Unfortunately some student find wrong way and do something wrong to get more money without care about moral and their family.

"I think smoking in public places such as indoors of a restaurant shoudn't be allowed. There's a few good reasons for me saying that. It has been proved that smoking kills you. Besides, would you like someone smoking next to you if you have your baby with you? Not only that, But I don't think I would like anyone to be smelling the nasty smoke odors while they're eating. I also think that it shoudn't be allowed because since it's indoors all the smoke gets caught inside and it can get sort of hard to even breathe. Choosing to smoke or not to smoke is a right that every human has. Those who choose to smoke should respect non-smokers while in enclosed areas. Many public buildings have a smoke free policy. Some restaurants also have a smoke free policy, but the majority do not. Having a smoke free policy in all restaurants creates numerous positive rewards. Banning smoking in restaurants will benefit the smoker, the business, and the non-smoker. Certain chemicals become more dangerous in small buildings. Smoking outside compared to smoking in a restaurant differs enormously. Outdoors, smoke spreads throughout a greater area. In restaurants however, smoke spreads throughout a small area. It can help not just the restaurant it self but also the society.",B1.2
"I think smoking is bad, but the society needs. Today our pressure is growing with the new technology and globalize. We even have little time to exercise or some ways to set out the pressure. Many adult smoking for a lot of reasons. If government wants to ban, I think the crime will grow up because the cigarette market is large today. The government can't ban at all, but it can restrict the smoking place to improve citizens healthy. I agree this policy. If any, separate smoking people and non-smoking people at same place also a good idea, because everyone has his own freedom. Citizen need to have a healthy environment. I think the correct education is the basic important thing. Government should make this aspect well. But nowadays too much people smoking, banning smoke from public places maybe a good and direct way. Fist, this can protect those who are not smoking people. They don't have to endure the bad air around them. Second, this policy can let the smoking people reduce a lot cigarette a day. Because they need to find somewhere they can smoke, they may think it's very inconvenience. For the reason, they may quite smoke gradually.",B1.1
"Should smoking be completely banned at all restaurants? Smokers will say no. Nonsmokers will say of course! Although the government has published some laws to ban smoking in public places and some restaurants, there are still amount of restaurants ignore these laws. Most people know that cigarettes include a lot of harmful chemical compositions. These compositions are not only harmful for smokers but also nonsmokers. The smoke compounding with the air filling the place which the smokers smoke will harm pregnant women, children and so on. Doctors suggest that smoking will enhance the rate of getting cardiac disease, high temperature and lung cancer etc. Furthermore, it can also have a bad effect on babies' and children's brain development. As for me, I hate the smell of the cigarettes. I believe that there are a lot of people like me don't like the smell. Especially in restaurants! People go to a restaurant to have a meal. In many times, they want to celebrates something or want a good temperature during a meal. Nobody wants to smell that. Thus, from these aspects, I would say smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, even in many public places such as movie theater and school, in the country.",B1.1
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Some points that the only reason that this topic is being tackled is due to the health problems that smoking causes to the non-smokers but it will be unfair to the smokers if this rule happens. First off, most if not all restaurants in the country have portions in their restaurants designated as for smokers, hence giving a place for these smokers to smoke and not affect the non-smokers. Once this rule is applied to the country, there might be an economic disaster waiting to happen because cigarette is one big portion of the country's economy. In Metro Manila alone, I believe there are two cigarette factories and if this rule happens, it will ruin the lives of the workers in these factories hence bringing less investment in our country. It will create a disastrous effect in the economy of the country because just this year, the MMDA has imposed a no smoking rule to public places. It has shut down a lot of smoking spots that lessened the buying rate of cigarettes to its consumers. Adding this other rule would drastically change the minds of its consumers and makers that it might force the makers to pull back its investments here in our country, greatly damaging the economy of the country. It won't guarantee the success of the project to lessen air pollution because it is not the cigarettes that really pollute the air but the gas from cars and factories. We may all now that cigarettes do damage the lungs especially the second hand smokers but taking out smoking in restaurants doesn't guarantee that these smokers will stop. Hence I disagree that smoking should be completely banned to all restaurants in the country.",B2

Don't neglect your education and you can keep money from your job. This way is good for your life. I agree with college students to have a part-time job.

We might study in same class but we don't have same life. Finally everybody found a work is match for us. But before those days, today we should spend the time to make everything its good for our life in the future. We don't leave time for bad thing. We will build our way from this day.

"Having a part-time job during university, it provides lots of personal and social benefits. Not only university students can take the advantages, but also the society.

They earn money for their daily lives that learn to become financial independent. Also, teenagers can experience the real society before graduation. It's a rare opportunity to build up their own network, which benefits them a lot in future. Moreover, it's easier for them to set up targets after having working experience. For commercial society, on the other hand, the higher education level had, the higher salary offered. Due to lack of liquids, but, it's hard for small companies to employ educated elits. So, undergraduaters are suitable choices for these campanies. They are not only well-educated, but they also have more creativity than adults who work for many years.

"Nowadays, we turn lazier and lazier with our life's being more and more well-off. Perhaps you are very unhappy to hear this, but it's the truth.. Especially in our parents' protective wings, we lack the passion of doing hard works. Before we went to college, our parents had designed the future life for us. So we are used to accepting their arrangements and don't want to pay too much. Unlikely to our parents, they did many hard labors when they were youngsters. Therefore, I think it's reasonable that many people called this generation to be the flowers in warm house. Thus, I don't like this opinion. To get rid of this saying, I advise that all college students do part-time job. It is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, many college students have been addicted to their parents' concern for a long time so as to lose their self-existence ability. Taking a part-time job can force them learning how to be independent. Secondly, it will make them treasure money and don't waste money. Thirdly, it can help them form working experience so that they will be easier to find a decent job after they graduate from college. It is acknowledged that almost every company has demand in employee's working experience when they employ a stuff. Forthly, it can strongthern their mental ability in bearing failure. You know, to a person never meet any difficulity, once he suffers from a few obstales, maybe he will break down. Concludely, in my perspective, it has necessity that we should stumilate college students' motivation in doing part-time job. In modern society, inevitably, a person who can only study in books wouldn't be accepted by the public.",B1.1
"I agree with this statement for various reasons. The first reason is because studying costs a lot of money and it should not just be the job of the parents to pay for all of our education. Parents work very hard and pay for education right through until we leave university. Doing a part-time job also shows our parents that we are mature and responsible. Also, when we enter college, we are no longer children and so we should take it upon ourselves to find part-time work in order to help with the costs. I also believe that when we reach college age we should be taught the value of money and doing a part time job helps us realize this. College should be a special time in our lives when we learn not only from books but from the people around us. Learning from people and colleagues where we work enables college students to grow up quicker and learn about ""life. "" Finally, doing a part-time job helps us realize what job we might want to do when we graduate. Those experiences could also show us what jobs we don't want to do when we leave college. I think it is important to have a part time job that you can learn many things while doing it. Parents should encourage their kids to get jobs as soon as they reach the correct age.",C2
"I agree with this topic. I think that the restaurant is a place for relaxing or meeting with family, friends, or lover. It is a good time to talk or sharing some ideas.

It will have directly problem to yourself such as you will not have good health; the disease might increase, and can make you lost of money. Everyone all ready know that there is bad side than good side, so smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Moreover, smoking will make you have bad personality and not good for the children in the society. All adults should give good thing to the children. Stop smoking can make the world have fresh air, you will have good looking; don't make any trouble to the others.

Needless to say, it is very important for college students to earn money, especially for living alone. We spend a lot of money, so we need as much money as possible. Third, we can make friends. There are many people in the working place, so we can be good terms of them. However, I don't have any part-time job now. I'm too busy to have part-time job. We college students have a lot of things to do. We should have a driver's license, study hard and club activity and so on. In addition, I'm not familiar with my college, so I am going to have a part-time job after summer vacation. I am going to teach junior high school students.

I was lucky because I didn't need the extra financial support since my parents were kind enough to pay for everything. This allowed me more time to study and also gave me relaxation time as well. I saw many students who were always stressed and rushing around to get to the next class or start their job on time. It was a real hassle for them and a few of them dropped out because they could not cut it. A few of them said that they would return in the Fall or the next year, but that didn't happen and I never saw them again. I am not trying to sound like a hard ass here, but they were never going to finish college anyway I think. A couple of my friends worked and studied and they seemed to have their heads together and did OK. But I believe that they were the exception and not the rule. With all of the study that I had to do, I don't know how I would have been able to work and get the high scores that I did as well. Maybe that's just not me and as I mentioned, it's not something that everybody can do. Students would do so much better if they didn't have to worry about money as well.",C2
"I think government should set the rule which is no smoking in every restaurant in the country. First, smoke is not good to who is pregnant. Second, not everyone likes the smell of smoke. Otherwise, I think smoke is unhealthy active, kids maybe will learn when they saw that. The smoke also could let the restaurant into unhealthy place, because of second hand smoke. It's not a good thing for restaurant, because the consumer maybe less. Of course it's not effective policy. Because even government set that rule, the smoker could smoke outside the restaurant. But if it can make smoker less, I think it's a good situation. It also can let the restaurant's atmosphere become good. For smoker, it's a good chance to quit this unhealthy active, a lot of lung disease come from smoke. Many search can prove that. But it's not effective for the smoker. Because they rely on the smoke to less the pressure. The policy of ban the smoke just let the restaurant's consumer less. Because a lot of men want to smoke even they are eating dinner. It's unchangeable true situation. I think government should set more rule like this not only in restaurant. Try to make no-smoke society. It's difficult but it's also could make the country into good situation. Because the power of government is from people. if people doesn't have good healthy, it's not good for the country's development.",B1.1
"Some people who smoke may make someone in restaurant or public places not only effect the health of the smokers but also the people around them such as your parent, children, pregnant and senior etc. Wanting to ban smoking in public places isn't about taking away a smoker's rights. You will still have the right to smoke in your own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with. We should write rules for the person who smoke in the restaurant or all the public place that they should not smoke if you want to smoke you should go back home and smoking. I totally agree that smoking should be banned from restaurant or all public places. It causes harm not only to the individuals who are smoking, but to the people around them too. I think that smoker should stop smoke for yourself and people around you. Furthermore if you stop smoking you will have a good health. You should change yourself to exercise all do other activities such as play sports indoor or outdoor, eating fresh food and vegetable, chewing the gum replace smoking. If you stop smoking it make you save money and save your long life.",B1.1
Student life is full of excitement and thrill. Some students give full time to their studies to get good marks. Parents of some student can afford all of the expenses of college while others can't. Students who are keen to get food result despite of their poverty are faced to do part time jobs to fulfill their college expenses. The effort is good but causes bad effect on their studies. They could not focus on their studies. For instance a student goes to college daily and after wards it works at a workshop or at a store etc. till afternoon. A human and especially a teen ager become fatigue after all these activities so how could he pay full time and full energy to his studies with open mind. After this clarification it is proved that part time jobs for students are not recommendable. This also affects their result for which they are doing all this. This is the responsibility of the Government and authorities that they should take necessary steps to overcome this situation. Such students whose parents can't bear the burnet of their studies should be awarded scholarships to buy up their aims. They should be back up to pay full attention on their studies leaving behind other actives of life in college. They should be making carefree from these college expenses so that they pay full attention to their studies. Students doing part time jobs are also cock in health. Government should realize that we can't destroy our future by losing the talent of our country.,B1.2
"Have you heard of the argument for university students taking a part-time job? The answer is definitely yes. Should we support or oppose it? Let us examine the issue. To begin with, let us find out why people are in favour of this argument? It is a simple and irrefutable fact that students can get experience through having a part-time job. Evidently, students can get teaching experience when being a tutor. They can learn how to be a good teacher at early state. Furthermore, students can learn how to deal with customers and communicate with the others when being sales. These are important for employees and employers. Another reason is that students can definitely benefit from the arrangement. According to an official study, there are considerable pros of the arrangement as it helps students develop a sense of responsibility. Students will never be late or absent from university after having a part-time job. Since employers do not allow employees being late or absent. Without doubt, university students taking part-time jobs are controversial subject. Although many people think that the argument is beneficial to university students in Hong Kong, there are some drawbacks. Taking part-time job is very time-consuming. Students will lose their time for study. Therefore, they have bad performance in examination. Personally, I am for the arrangement because its pro outweigh its cons.",B1.2
"Even though there may be some advantages to having a part-time job, I think it is not important for college students to do that. There are three reasons; studying time, sleeping time, and being obsessed with money. First, students should use their time for study because their real work is studying. It is a privilege of students to have such a long time to study and improve their skills. In addition, they pay a lot of money for college to attend. Therefore, they should concentrate on their study and do their best. However, part-time job will cut their time for study a lot. I think it is not good for students. Second, some students work for a long time and it cut their time to sleep. There're a many kind of part-time job, and I heard that some students work at bar or pub which open until late at night. Because of that, they work and come back home very late, it prevent them from keeping regular hours. Therefore, in the next morning, they're too sleepy to concentrate on their classes. It makes vicious circle in their lifestyle. Third, there's a possibility of being obsessed with money. In a part-time job, the longer you work, the richer you become. So some students who really want money can be a money-grubber and work hard too much. I think it can motivate them to earn money, but remove their motivation to study. It is very dangerous fact. For all of these reasons, I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.",B2
"One of the major problems that the world faces today is the rapid growth of smokers. Smoking is the inhalation of the smoke of burning tobacco enclosed in cigarettes, pipes, and cigars. Smoking rate has recently risen to billions. More than 400, 000 deaths in the U. S. each year are from smoking-related illnesses. It is said that smoking a single cigarette decreases ones life 10 days. Smoking is one of the most difficult addictions to break. It is estimated that cigarettes are more addictive than heroin or alcohol. According to the WHO, smoking kills more people than any ailment in the world. Most people who smoke do so because they can't stop. Nicotine is a highly addictive stuff that makes people feel thrilled and attentive. It only has the dark side and it is a fact. Smoking harms not only the smoker, but also family members as well as all people around you. Smoking directly damages the lungs of a individual, causes cancers, heart strokes etc. etc. The mixture of nicotine and carbon monoxide in each cigarette you smoke increases your heart rate for the moment and blood pressure increases. It also causes environmental pollutions. Young generation just starts it as a fun with friends and very soon they are addicted. It is the need of time to stop such a hazardous addiction. The only solution to this problem is prohibition by government and awareness programs to save young generation.",B1.2
" Teenagers longings adult's image and status, with smoking to represent grow on your own, or representative mature feeling and charm. Junior middle school students, high school students of smoking are mostly boys. Small smokers usually can't open on parents and teachers, so the toilet before smoking, the way to school, such as Internet cafes ""gloomy corner"" become their smoking stronghold. Smoking can damage the brain, make thinking become slow, memory loss, impact study and work, make the students' academic performance decline. Smoking is harmful to health, to make us teenagers initiative away from tobacco, away from harm, I think I should rely on our society, family and school joint effort. Teenagers of curiousity, like to imitate adult, also want to experience a few when smoking, easiness too comfortable feeling. In addition, students have no economy source, smoking more money is through deception parents or steal home get. Some students are through threats, fraud is relatively smaller classmates even steal others' property and come, smoking not only influence yourself, but also hurt others, polluted campus environment. As teenage has no own ability, they cannot pay for smoking expenses, as time passes, can produce a lot of social problems, make the juvenile crime increased, spreading to the whole society. The rise in teenage smoking, for our nation and society is a potential problem. Smoking on adolescents' health is a great threat, many adults diseases with teenage smoking related. In order to prevent children to smoke, parents should first set an example, oneself do not smoke, and try to control cause child smoking conditions. With patience and love, and give them to build up a good environment",B1.2
"In my eyes, smoking has no advantages but so many disadvantages. But obviously, it is hard enough for people to give it up. Firstly, smoking is very bad for your health especially your heart and lung. At first, you may not feel a bit, but when you are old, you can not stop coughing and you feel tired all the time. Secondly, families and friends around you are badly hurt from your smoking. Many conveys said that smoking have even worse effect on the people around smokers. Thirdly, smoking makes the environment worse and worse. People must live in a dirty world. The air is so bad that more and more lung patients come forth. What is more, smoking won't cost a little so that you save money if you don't smoke. However, smoking can't be entirely forbidden although there are many signs saying No smoking. We everyone should try our best to persuade our parents and friends to give up smoking. And the government should make some more efficient rules to prevent smoking from appearing in the public occasion. As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is how to stop students from smoking because the number of young smokers becomes more. I wish there were no smoking in the world one day.",B1.2
"Smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants because smoking indoors affects everyone inside the building, both smokers and non-smokers. Dividing dining rooms into smoking and non-smoking areas does not provide a true shelter from the smoke for non-smokers, nor does designating times when smoking is not allowed, but allowing smoking during other times. The smoke lingers in the air throughout the restaurant and creates an unpleasant odor that certainly affects the customers' dining experience. Restaurateurs should be concerned about this because fragrance is a large part of enjoying food, and having cigarette smoke mixed into the air will have negative effects on non-smokers, who did nothing to add that smoke to the atmosphere in the restaurant. Non-smokers who do not want to be around smoke while they are eating will find a different place to eat given the choice, or may even decline invitations to restaurants where smoking is allowed, which represents a loss of business for restaurateurs. A physical disadvantage to allowing smoking inside of a restaurant is that wallpaper yellows and needs to be replaced more often due to exposure to smoke over time. Add to that the possible loss of business due to non-smokers choosing other restaurants, and it starts to make financial sense to ban smoking inside restaurants. Japan features some restaurants with smoking areas or rooms fully enclosed by walls or glass with special fans sucking the smoky air out of the room, and these seem to work well toward keeping smoke away from the rest of the restaurant. If installing these smoking rooms is cost-effective, there could be a way to allow smoking inside of restaurants, but it may be the only way if non-smokers exercise their right to decide and take their business elsewhere.",C2
What are the importances of having a part time job as a student? What are the disadvantages of having a part time job? The importance of having a part time job as students are having financial independence so they don't have to always ask their parents for money everytime there's a project and things to buy. They will learn the value of money and be responsible in spending the money that they work hard for. Also it makes the students productive. We will learn the value of money. It will give the students more confidence. They will learn how to balance work with studies thus having better time management. Having a part time job while studying can help the students acquire experiences for later life; they won't have to worry about not getting a job because of not having any experience. Having a part time can also help the students to associate with other people and be more sociable. It will also help them to enhance their personal skills. But there are also the disadvantages of having a part time job such as: too much money in hands of a student can lead to bad habits like doing drugs. They can also drop their education because of knowing that they can already earn money so they don't need to study anymore. Having a part time job can also interfere with their studies and can be a reason for them to fail. It can also affect their health by being over fatigue with school and work thus making them sick.,B1.2
"Smoking should not be banned in all restaurants. Restaurants in general have two types of seating available: smoking and non-smoking. Such an arrangement is fundamentally due to legislative reasons such as the prohibition of smoking indoors. However, this also gives customers a choice on where they would like to be seated. In the smoking areas of the restaurants, customers are generally more relaxed and at ease because they are free to smoke as they wish. Smoking is after all, a personal lifestyle choice. As such, why should anyone be deprived of the right to make a choice for himself? If we are concerned that secondhand smoke may irritate other restaurant guests, then there may be a problem with the seating arrangement of the restaurant. The smoking and non-smoking areas should not be too closely located so as to respect the choices of both groups of customers. There is no reason to ban smoking in restaurants just because we want to ensure that non-smokers are not affected by the secondhand smokes. Such a move would be as extreme as saying smoking should be allowed anywhere and everywhere so as to accommodate the needs of smokers. I firmly believe that there should always exist a balance between any decisions. ",B2
"I think this statement is very good for many people. I think we should not smoke at restaurant. Because some people don't like smoke. There are many kinds of people and families with children at restaurant. Smoking make many people get uncomfortable. I think smoke have us don't taste and smell food. It is no means to eat and impolite for cooks. However, some kinds of people want to smoke at any place, only restaurant. They don't have any bad feelings for people who don't smoke. So I would like to both groups have good times. Recently, smoking area separates non-smoking area in many restaurants. But some smoke come non-smoking area. In this way, it is no means to separate. It is admitted to smoke at some restaurants, strong air conditioner should be had in them to remove smoke and change air. So I think we should separate smoking and non-smoking area completely. For example, to make two flours or to build two buildings. But they are very costly and it needs wide ground. It is difficult to realize. It is the easiest way that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. But I want to find better way for both groups.",A2
"I agree because it is more important to safeguard Japanese people's health rather than to protect businesses. Without a doubt, smoking causes many health problems which have proven to be the case time and again. Restaurants should adapt to a ban without protest, because in the long run, they will be better off. For example, after a ban was implemented in New South Wales, Australia, only a small percentage of restaurants reported a decrease in trade. In locations where the bans have been introduced, there have been very few problems encountered. Hefty penalties put many businesses off the idea of allowing people to smoke and gradually, it has come to be accepted as'the norm'. The difficulties in implementing similar bans in Japan would include, but not be limited to, the policing of a restaurant ban. It would be extremely difficult to monitor all small restaurants tucked away in the back streets of many small suburbs. Therefore, the government would be relying mostly on the honour system where the onus would be upon the restaurant owner to enforce such a ban. While it may be possible for the police or some type of smoke inspector to make sporadic spot checks, it is doubtful that they would be able to cover every area on a regular basis.",C2
" As the number of the smokers coming up, more and more public place are surrounded by smoke. In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public place. As we know, smoking does harm to the smokers, and smoking is able to make a healthy man go to death. But what many people don't know is that the second smoking does much more harm to the people who don't smoke. And it means that all the people who stay in the public places where there are smokers will get bad influence. Pubulic place is that everyone can stay in. So it should be O. K to everyone. For our health, we should forbid people smoking in public place. Public place should be beautuful and be comfortable. But smoking can make much smoke make much smoke which is smell bad surround the public place. So it will be made incomfortable. And many people maybe get away because of the smoke. Public places are for everyone. For the beauty of the public place, we should forbid people smoking in public place. So I think we should forbid people smoking in public place. We need a beautful and comfortable public place!",B1.1
"I don't like smoking. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, it is true that smoking gives serious damage not only a person who smoke but also a person who is near from his or her. People who smoke get lung cancer than people who don't smoke. Second, I think the most serious problem is smoking at the restaurant make people who don't smoke feel very uncomfortable. Break fast, lunch, and dinner is the time that all of the people enjoy eating and relax. And a restaurant is the place where people enjoy eating and relax. At the same time, however, a restaurant is not the private place but the public place. Perhaps some people relax when they smoke. But I think smoking in a restaurant is bad manner. To enjoy eating all of the people, each person should stop smoking. So all the restaurants should make a rule that bans smoking. If people want to smoke, they should go outside and enjoy smoking. These days smoking banned day by day. I think it is good moving for all of the people to make comfortable environment and good health.",A2
"In today's society, more and more college students have part time job after school. In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time. I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. Besides, I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. We will also have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help teenagers find their ideal job more easily in the future. And the teenagers can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in their future working circumstance. Teenagers can also expand their interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I have read an article; it said, Without friends, we will not do anything perfectly. Interpersonal relationship is really very important in our working place. In summary, perhaps many people will think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help teenagers ' future become much better, no matter in the attitude toward money, in getting working experiences, or in interpersonal relationship.",A2
"Smoking was practiced by Native Americans in both North and South America as far back as 100 A. D. Tobacco was originally used by these people in religious ceremonies, but later it became common to smoke for pleasure. Cigars are also rolled in tobacco leaves while cigarettes are rolled in paper. The leaves used to roll cigars must be thin, smooth, and of good color for the best cigar. According to the study, chewing tobacco increased the risk of heart attack two-fold and smokers had a three-fold increased risk of a heart attack compared to people who had never smoked hate smoking. I don't understanding smoker. They are why smoking. Smoking is very bad thing. Smoking is hazardous to your health. It certainly wasn't worth the money we paid to see it. I hope to government outlawed smoking in all public buildings and street. I want high taxes have recently been imposed on cigarettes. Many smokers are remembering informant fact. Don't forget active smokers are passive smokers too. It's very disgusting and stressful. Hang out with people who don't smoke. I don't really understand any person who smokes. I can't stand it when people smoke as they walk down the street. The air is already polluted, so I don't understand why people want to smoke",A2
"I agree with this idea that smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in Japan. I have three reasons. Firstly, this is because that smoke is too bad for all the people. According to the survey, breathing smoke indirectly is worse for health smoking directly. Breathing smoke of tobacco causes lung cancer. Secondly, this is because most of people who don't smoke hate smoke. It is fool thing that people who don't smoke suffer from lung cancer because of breathing smoke indirectly, so they hate smoke. I suggest one example. When you eat dinner with your boss in the restaurant and he is smoking, if you hate smoke, can you ask him not to smoke? When you're in this situation, I think the restaurant that bans from smoking is convenient. Optionally, employees who hate smoke are easy to come to work. Thirdly, it takes expense very much to install a fan that take in the smoke of tobacco in each table. If smoking is banned, the fan is needless. In conclusion, because of these reason I agree that this idea. If I say a desire, smoking should be completely banned not only at the restaurant but also at the other place we visit.",B1.1
"College students are often seen having part time jobs aside from their academic commitments, but mostly because they need the extra pocket money. These teenagers are often in transition to their early adulthood and would have a more acute awareness of their finances, coupled with a high spending propensity on needs and wants. However, there are other part time jobs college students could hold for non-financial gratification. Thus, on this level, it is important for college students to have part time jobs to support themselves and also for experience. Most importantly, it could be a headstart to their working life upon graduation, should they invest their time and effort in a job they are passionate in. However, they must not allow their primary role as a student to be relegated due to this new commitment. The importance of college students having part time jobs is made striking when they realise the working society differs from their school life by a huge measure. Often, their first foray into the economic realm is both exciting and daunting, depending on their choice of work. Should there be significant and substantial learning points in their course of work, these students would have added value to their college lives and also, advantageously illuminated their resume with their newly created wealth of experience.

"I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants, or s hould I say that smokers cannot stop smoking at restaurants. They may stop c oming to restaurants because they cannon smoke! If a restaurant rejects peop le who love smoking, this lost must be large for the owners of the restauran t, although customers who hate smoking may come there more frequently. Now, there are some systems to divide between smokers and nonsmokers. For example, some designate time to protect nonsmokers from smoke. We cannot smoke amon g the time. Others designate places for smokers and nonsmokers. Such systems are enough to eat good food and make us comfortable. In fact, in a restaura nt where smokers and nonsmokers are completely mixed, I cannot stop coughing. However, when I have a lunch at a family restaurant, I do never conversely worried smoke thanks to division. Furthermore, now the technology to absor b smoke is developing. This may enable nonsmokers to eat lunch next to smoke rs comfortably in the future. Taking profit of restaurants into consideratio n, these steps are realistic and reasonable. If every people can have a good time, we don't necessarily exclude smokers. We only need to invent good wa y to divide smokers and nonsmokers.",B1.1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. We have a lot of events in college life. For example club activity and drinking party. So we must make money. Until we are high school students, we get money by our parents. But college students are nearly adult or truly adult. So we should have a part time job to make money by ourselves. But then some people may say that college students should not spend their time to do a part time job, they should spend the time to study. I think that the idea is not wrong. It mai be best if we can do. But it is very difficult to do such. In fact I have some friends who don't have a part time job. They don't study hard and they get money to enjoy various events by their parents. I don't like such a way very much. I think that students who have a part time job can finish their homework earlier than who don't have it do. The students who don't have it may think that they have a lot of time, so they can do homework anytime. Due to that, their start to do homework may be late. And I think it is also important for us to experience a part time job. I think study, club activity, part time jobs etc all things are a part of college life.",B1.1
"Part time job is a job that is done in your free time. You don't need to work all day. You just work to waste your spend time. For instance, you work at supermarket as a cashier, you give the course for elementary student and many others. Today there are many college students that doing part time job during their studying. They do part time job to fulfill their daily needs. They also do it to help their financial support. Having a part time job is very important for college student. The first reason is they need to fulfill their daily needs during studying such as, for buying books, for copying materials, and many other needs. It is impossible for college student ask their parents a lot of money to support their daily needs, moreover if their parents do not have a lot of money. The second reason is, they have a part time job during studying is useful to support their economy. For instance, they can buy everything as they want from money that they get of having part time job. They do not need to ask their parents again. They also can help their parents in financial side such as for buying their daily need in house. It is useful and helping for their parents. The last reason why college student having a part time job is for saving their salary. They can save their money for their needs in the future for example to continue their study after they were graduated from bachelor degree. Further more they can also use their money for business, or getting married. Therefore, having part time job is very important for college student to fulfill their daily needs and help them to create a great planning for their better future.",B1.1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Personally, I have a great dislike for the smell of smoke. However, even if we look at this issue objectively, it has many reasons to why it should be completely banned. Firstly, the harm of taking in second-hand smoke by unwilling non-smoker is the main reason. Taking in second hand smoke harms the lung of people who are not willing and yet are suffering it. Besides the health issue, the environment that customers wish to enjoy while dining will be destroyed as well. No customer who is a non-smoker will like to bear the ""smoky"" environment. Furthermore, they are paying for it as a customer. Secondly, being a restaurant, it will be an enclosed area which smoking will result an environment that will be not enjoyable for customer. This is unlike coffee shop which is open area and a smoker's corner can be designated smoker. Even though some restaurants have open areas, I will like to discourage designating a smoker's corner because this method may not be very useful. This is because there is still a possibility that the smoke generated from smoking can enter the enclosed dinning area. ",B1.2
"It should be banned, definitely. And the reason is, smoking is dangerous to not only the smokers, everyone who's standing near the smoker also suffers from the 'might of the nicotine' too. However, there're still more of things I want to talk about it. Okay, let me talk about this topic a bit more. As I've already stated above, smoking should be completely banned because of its 'smoking dangerous' characteristics, and it should find its edge of extinction as soon as possible. Smoking is like a suicide, you know? Because the more you smoke, the sooner you'll meet your maker. If you aren't dead, then some parts of your body may be devastated by tar and nicotine. These substances are the harbinger of cancer and other kinds of diseases, which are more than potential to kick you to the graveyard or the cremation site. It really is dangerous as I've said, I dare say. Oh, I've almost forgotten one thing; smoking also causes the weather bad, full of bad smelling smoke isn't a good thing for your health. That's it, that's the reason why the restaurants owners all over our country should ban smoking from their working places.

It should also limit the opportunity to smoke in public places, and workplace; regulation and control of cigarette promotional advertising; post the health warnings on cigarette packs and cigarette advertising.

"Everyone knows that smoking is harmful to our health. Even in the pack of the cigarettes, the warning is printed. Although smokers do aware of this fact, many of them do not quit smoking because it is addictive. I also hate smoking, but I disagree to the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Rather, I think it is much better to make smokers smoke only in the smoking area. To begin, this will never stop smokers to smoke. Instead, they will find somewhere else in the restaurant such as bathroom or the entrance of the restaurant because smoking is addictive. It is true that if we ban smoking inside, it would make much better atmosphere for customers who do not like smoking because there are no smokers in their surroundings directly. But, still, customers might feel smokes, if smokers smoke in the bathroom secretly or in the entrance of the restaurant. It affects to other people because the smoke might flow into the restaurant. However, we can solve this problem by making the smoking area. Banning smoking completely would not solve the problem at all, and many owners of the restaurant may also refuse this option, worrying smoking customer would not come. But if we change the proposal as making restricted area for smokers, smoking area, it will satisfy both non-smokers and smokers. By satisfying all kinds of the customers, owners will also like this idea, which is more realistic proposal to everyone. Therefore, banning smoking completely in the restaurant is unrealistic and ineffective way for the convenience of customers. Of course, it would be the best option to quit smoking to every smoker, but because this is quite impossible, it is much better to open some place to smoke which is only for the smokers.",B2

It is because that we should go to college to study something interesting for us and that we should start having full-time job at once if we think making money is the most important. I think experiencing a part-time job is good unless our study make bad result. By having a part-time job, we can communicate with people who we can't talk with in my usual college life. That experience is useful now, not only in our future. Now, I teach some subjects in the cram school where I went in my high school days. IJ talk with my students and other teachers not only study but also anything else. They vary in age from young to elderly, so their ideas are different very much. I can get a lot of views. My senior has a part-time job at old people's home. He supports their life and talk with them. They sometimes forget who he is and repeat the same story to him. But he told me that their peculiar atmosphere and their figures thank many people sent him. We can't do such experience when we go to only college, so I think having a part-time job is important for college students.",B1.2
"Basically I am agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I will show you some reasons to back up my point of view. First of all, we college students are no more those little kids who can not distinguish the bad from the good in society or even can not care for themselves well. We just can't live our life with our parents protection and care forever. So it is the part-time job that really gives us an opportunity to show our talent and burden responsibilities. Secondly, through the process of doing a part-time job, not only can we learn how to deal with various people from the different parts of world but also we can understand the complex society more specifically and sharply rather than read all those meaningless books in school. A part-time job can strengthen us greatly and then equip us with more practical knowledge to step into the world. Thirdly, we college students usually have more free time compared with the high school students so working outside will not affect our study greatly as long as we arrange our schedule appropriately. Lastly, we are already 18 years old and it's high time that we became less dependent of our parents and made some money to give them a little relief. Put the four pieces together, we can come to the conclusion that having a part-time job is of great importance and benefit to the college students.",B1.1
"Cigarettes are made from tobacco grown in everywhere around the world. Most of countries grant the factories to produce cigarettes. A lot of profits both government and enterprise earned each year. However, WHO knows the danger of cigarettes for smokers and non-smokers will be equal or even worse for their health. Smoking can cause cancer and many other symptoms. Smoke in public places such as public parks, bus stops or in the streets which are in the open areas cause harmful effect to health for both smokers and non-smokers who presents in the areas. If smokers smoke in the closed area such as in the theater, house, restaurant, air plane, etc. It will cause more danger because both smokers and non-smokers will be easily harmed by smoke. Restaurants are the place where people come to enjoy their foods and drinks especially with their families. Smoking could ruin the atmosphere in the restaurants and also cause danger to health of all people around them. The air conditioner in restaurants will make it even worse when smokers start smoking their cigarettes, because there is no air ventilates to get rid of all smoke and it will be in their breath and to all lungs of people. Government, especially ministry of public health must realize about the health of people and establish the law against smoking in the restaurants both non-air condition and air condition to keep people away from smoke of cigarettes. I strongly recommend that smoking should be completely banded at all restaurants in the country.",B1.1
"The opinion, that it is important for college student to have a part-time job, has some merit. There are several reasons why this is a good idea. Firstly, a college education is a significant expense for a college student and their family. Many families do not have the capital to pay the full cost of a college education and thereby have to cover the tuition by taking out a bank loan and in some cases even mortgaging their house or business. This puts a significant amount of strain on the family finances. Therefore, if college students can assist their families with financing, they should. Even if they don't earn enough to help with college tuition, a part-time job can help them pay for all personal expenses or study materials, thereby, reducing the pressure on their parents and encouraging them to become independent, mature adults. Secondly, a significant reason for all young people, including college students, to have part-time jobs is because it is great for the economy. In many countries, including Japan, a large percentage of shoppers are young people. They are the first to take notice of changes in fashion and technology and they often want to buy the latest products, thereby reviving the economy. In addition, when college student are working at local shops their labor cost is low, so shop owners can pass these savings onto the customer. This final point is most important to me.",C2
"To smoked in the restaurant? Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I think agree. Smoking has to ban in the entire restaurant. Because smoking is harmful any people. People is happy to eat food in the restaurant, but if have a one guy to smoky. I think any people are very unhappy. It is very not politeness. I think have to a rule to do in the country. If have a rule can let people know smoking is wrong in the restaurant. So I think should a rule in the restaurant. I think can to reduce very bad exemp for child. The public place is every people have to do. Many people don't like smoke taste. To smoke is very bad especially for child and student. To smoke is a very bad exemp. So we can't to learn this bad to be used smoking. If I also don't like to smoke. Because smoking maybe let our health is bad. If you go to see in the hospital. You should know to pay attention your health everyday. So everyone can't to smoke in the public place not only in the restaurant. We should know this rule. It is not to cause the other people.",A2
"Since students step into the college, a lot of them want to learn and get the most knowledge and more ability for working in the future. In addition to classroom and learning outside classroom can gave them more knowledge, include working a part time job. A part time job gave many advantages, because there are many things to learn and many case studies to receive for prepare to working. Is the learning outside classroom and learning experiences outside the classroom in mind the fact work, it easy to qualify when graduation. Moreover it generates revenue, which reduce expenditure from them parent. If they have tried, it might make them aware of their own ability or can develop better, for example: if some student can play music or have a good singing then he or she work a part time job with music, it can develop in him or herself. A part time job is considered important to students on college. Students who have passed the part time job are more experience than students who not used to work part time job. For educational quality, this should encourage students to work part time job for finding or develop their ability and more knowledge than in the classroom.",B1.1
"Every person in this world has some basic needs in common. One should have food, good clothes, good standard of living and good education. But all this can be got by one if one has sufficient money. And for money, one has to do jobs according to the law of nature. But due to the increase in world-poverty especially in some countries, the income of a single person is not sufficient to fulfil all the basic requirements. So, our young generation specially the college students, along with their study do the part time jobs to have better standard of living, each and everything better and better life style. The students of higher secondary level in comparatively backward areas in the world do part time jobs, but this activity interferes their study. They have to work hard enough. This interferes their health. For the progress of a country, its youth must be educated and strong. It must be strong enough to contribute a lot in making its society and country great. This all can be done if the government provides sufficient opportunities educate them, provide opportunities for their healthy activities and collect funds for them. Infect governments should provide opportunities for them to collect funds for them so they may also contribute to the progress of their society be paying attention on their studies.",B1.2
"I think smoking shoud be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because I often enjoy smell and taste of dinner at restaurants, but smoke destroys ohteres happy dinner time. Many people who do not smoke don't like the tabacco's smell. The smell erase good smell of food. Many restaurants depart the seats for smoker and for not smoker, however, smoke cover large space and make many people, not smoker, feel worse and not appitite. So. searts deparetion have no sense. And when we sit a seat after smokers, we suffer from the bad smell which remind in the seat. Smoking is bad thing especially bad thing at places to eat food and used by many people. Many people have knew the fact the smoke include bad material which cause a lot of illness. We go to restaurants to eat delisious food, not to get illness. I think there are many people who like to smoke, but they can do out of restaurants too. Recentry, at many insturuments used by many people in Japan, smoking is banned. At a official place, they think other people. So, to enjoy lunch, smoking should be banned completely at restaurants.",B1.1
"First, before I start the essay, I need to define what smoking means. Smoking in this context apparently refers to the act of putting a cigarette to one's mouth, lighting it, and puffing on it vigourously such that smoke from the cigarette enters your lungs. Generally, the effect of this would be to give that person a slight high due to the effect of nicotine on the mind. There are other definitions of smoking, such as the Singaporean definition, which is to pull wool over another's eyes. Now that I have defined smoking, I need to define restaurants. Restaurants can be defined as a place where people, generally humans of the species Homo sapiens sapiens, as opposed to Homo erectus, ingest sustenance. This sustenance is generally believed to taste good due to the fact that it was ingested in a restaurant. Since the purpose of the restaurant is to provide a place with ambience so that the food ingested is perceived to taste better, smoking detracts from this experience as smoking is generally disliked by the people around the smoker. As such, smoking should be completely banned from all the restaurants in the country as it detracts from the very purpose of a restaurant, which is to provide a location for people to enjoy good food. ",B1.2
"We all know that there are different harmful effects that we can get if we are smoking but I believe that smoking is a choice and I also believe that smoking in restaurants or in public places does not harm anyone. If we are going to ban smoking in restaurant/different places it will be unfair for the smokers because what I've said is that smoking is a choice. If smoke is our problem what about the smoke that came from cars and factories? Should we ban it too? If we are talking about banning smoking in restaurants it is not our choice, it's the owner of the restaurants choice or decision if he will be in favor of banning smoking In his/her restaurant because some of the restaurant that are selling cigarettes is part of their business to earn profit. If you don't want being near/around to those who smoke or you don't want the smell of it then you are free to leave the area. I am not against anybody or from the smokers and non-smokers because everyone of us has a right in this world. I think in the side of non-smokers, they want to ban smoking because even they are not smoking they still can get harmful effects from it by experiencing secondhand smoking. But smokers also have their own complain or reason why they don't want smoking to be banned. I believe that smoking is not bad because if we are smoking it is our choice and we need to accept if we will have harmful effects from it. It is not bad if they know how to use it properly/moderately. Smoking is a choice and no one is forcing anyone to smoke or not to smoke that's why it is not bad.",B1.2
Every man has the right to make his future strong. to take such actions that can secure his future. in the cut throat competition of two days world everyone is struggling for the betterment of his or her self. There are so many problems in our country that has become a constant source of worry for our citizens. One of the problems is price hike and insufficient salaries of the people. In Pakistan there is a growing trend of part time job. The point is thinking that from where trend has stared. Now days in Pakistan it become hard to earn bread and butter by single person with such a low salary. Govt. of Pakistan is unaware of that problem. the salaries of people are not so sufficient of support their families. hence for support they go for the second option i. e. part time job. But it becomes so difficult to manage because usually one can give full attention to only one job at a time. It is so heart touching to see the students doing part time job to sport their studies. Govt. should have to take notice of this situation. part time job is not as bad as it seems. It depends on the purpose for which you are doing so. it is totally prohibited for students because they can affect their studies by doing so. But if you are doing that to take experience or to support your nation then well and good. in short part time job has become a kind of necessity for people. They want to give better future to their families and it cannot be possible with low salaries that the Govt. is giving. so they should have adopt a side business or part time job. Perhaps it has its own advantages and disadvantages but they vary from person to person and their purpose of doing so.,B1.2
"A part time job is a job in which an employee does not work full hours and it often has the advantage of more flexible hours. Part time job seekers may be mostly students, householders who are engaged with other responsibilities. Many students work part time jobs to supply themselves with additional funds. Working part time is ideal for students, since it allows them to balance their academic needs with their school needs. Often, a school will provide a list of available part time jobs for the benefit of students. Today, a lots student are interesting to do part-time jobs because it can earn extra money, make new experience, and meet new people. Then part-time jobs may also offer benefits such as discounts to employees and in some regions of the world, as long as employee works at least half time, he or she is eligible for other employee benefits as well. These benefits may include sick pay, insurance, payments into pension funds, or vacation time. And especially student you can't miss opportunities to do part time job if you manage time well. It can pay much more than the basic hourly wage for you. Now, Finding part time jobs is not too difficult, you can surf the internet or find it on the newspaper. Then when you will receive good opportunities to get money from extra job. You feel proud! Finally, if you are someone that would like making extra money, why don't you finding a part time job to do and make big surprise for yourself.",B1.1
"I can't agree with that statement at all. Many college students that I know and also myself when I was a student, worked out of necessity. Aside from compulsory internships during summer vacation periods, the rest of the working time was only important because we needed the dollars. In my case, I was paying part of my way through college and was also attempting to get my student loans decreased rather than face a huge debt as soon as I graduated. If the statement was referring specifically to working out of necessity which it is not, then I could agree. The most important thing in college is doing well because it's a cutthroat world out here in the real world and we need every edge we can get. A part-time job is only important if financial circumstances dictate that it is a necessity or it is linked to some form of internship that will assist with future job prospects. Unfortunately, due to the current economic climate, part-time jobs are becoming more and more of a necessity otherwise we will see fewer and fewer new college enrolments and graduations. Many students, prospective and current are feeling the economic pressure that has been brought about by the near global financial collapse.",C2
"In recent years, many college graduates have difficulty in finding a job and face a fierece competition. The situtation has aroused a common concern about if is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Personally speaking, I adovocate college students should have a part-time job. On one hand, we know, college students have a part-time job can earn their pockets money, and in this way, it can reduce the burden of their family. Besides, they may make friends with many people from who college students can benefit a lots. On the other hand, as job markets are decreasing, unemployment among the graduates is increasing. College students have more skills and experience can make them more appealing to the employers and companies. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a good way to enrich your skills and experience when you at college. Taking advantage of your college free time, improving and enhancing yourself, when you graduate from college you will excel other college students and don't worry about you will face a fierce competition and cannot find a good job. In my perspective, a college student to have a part-time job has many adavantages and disadvantages. It is not only can earn money that can solve your financial crisis, but also you can learn a lot of experience and knowledge that can perfect you. So in order to have more chance than others, college students should take part-time job and make use of our free time to enhance oursleves.",B1.1
"I think students in university have to do a part-time is very important because it is practice before they congratulations from university and go to work in the future. I think student in university should do in part time job. For me, I am one person in my university have to do part time job. I always do part time job since I studied grade 8. I think it good for me. Part time job can give experience in work for me. Part time job made me become to patient person and have a new friend. I find new social from part time job. I spend my free time to part time job I feel happy because I think I can manage my time to benefits. I receive money from part time job and I divided my money to my parent. I can use money to travel with my family. I can buy anything what I want because it is my money. I receive it from I was work hard. May be part time job make me tired but it is funny. Part time job can increate quality in people. I agree student in university should do part time job.",A2
"It seems more and more Singaporean students would like to have a part-time job during their college life. Most of the students think it's good because they can earn extra pocket money, and to a lesser extent because the jobs would enrich their college life, and broaden their horizons on how a working class would be like. However, many parents are worrying that by working part time will sometimes affect their children's academic performance, as they often come home late from working place and do not have enough time for lessons and homework. I think a part-time job is advantageous for the students who can adequately arrange the time and those who can make sure the job itself won't distract them from the education. The student should put their school tasks as the priority, and only when the academic performance is satisfied, can they seek for part-time jobs. And, the best time is to take part-time jobs is in school holidays. Secondly, part-time jobs are usually lowly-paid works. I think the students could take a try on it but should never think they can rely on it to earn a lot of money. It is good to gain some working experience before going to the real society, but there's always chance even after graduation, such as gap years or internships. Therefore, part-time jobs are good for students who can handle their leisure time well and knows what is most important at their stage of life. ",B1.2
"Part time jobs are those activities which one performs other than his actual job or work. These jobs provide an opportunity to the people to earn extra income and improve their lifestyle. As for as the students are concerned, part time jobs could be very useful for them. It not only helps then to contribute to their family income but also physically and mentally prepared them for their future jobs. The first day of a student in college is full of excitement and enthusiasm. Gradually as the time pass by he become dull and bored because he has a huge burden of studies on his head as he does not get only time to relax and enjoy. Part time jobs can help them to reorganize themselves and to refresh. As it is famous proverb, All work and no play made jack a dull boy. In a part time job a student meets different people knows more about the social behavior. Then he sometimes gets appreciation and sometime he is scolded by his head officer. It provides him a physical activity and mental refreshes. After doing part time job he gets some time to his college homework. I think that a student can get more appreciation if he secures a position even he does a job alongside it as compared to a student who secures a position by sitting all the day and reading his book.",B1.1
"I think that part time job is not important but not bad for college student. It is most important thing for college student to study hard. Student's parents pay much money to college. Student can earn only about 2000 yen per an hour from part time job at the most but parents pay about 3000 yen to college. So student should not skip them class to part time job. But college student is not child. They need more money than parents provide them. For example they want to play with friends, buy books, cloths, games and etc. If they have perfect free time, I think that they can work on part time job. Of course, the part time job should not be too hard to study on next day class. They can not only earn money but also can get some good things from part time jobs. For instance, they can communicate with people out of college. College students hardly talk with people out of college. And they must not be angry with customer to earn money. So part time job make them more patient. The tim e of part time job give them things that they can not learn from college.",B1.1
"Smoking is a common activity in everyone's life. No matter who smoke, you cannot always avoid it. And the attitude to smoking is varied from people to people. In my opinion, smoking should be limited but shouldn't be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking can make people relaxed sometime. Especially for many businessmen under heavy stress, they need a convenient way to relax themselves. Smoking just can help them and keep them in a good condition. Secondly, for sure, smoking may be unhealthy to the smokers and the people around them. But smoking or not smoking is a private choice; we can't completely forbid it in all the restaurants. Just set a special place for these smokers in the restaurants can solve the problem too. Thirdly, if the smoking is banned completely in the restaurants, it must lead to terrible destroy in the cigarette industry. Many workers may lose their jobs and it will influence the economy of our society. So in conclusion, smoking should be limited in the restaurants but not banned completely in the restaurants. We just try to have a special place for smokers in the restaurants now and it will do less harm to non-smokers.",A2
"Agno is a famous eating place in our university. It is the place where you can find the most affordable yet delicious food around the university. As you pass by the street where it is located, you would immediately smell the aroma of the mixed variety of food they offer. If not of the hint of smoke, I would immensely enjoy the beautiful scent of mouth-watering food. The longer I stayed at the area, the more I could feel my nose slowly get clogged with polluted gas. Every time I think of this, I remember the image of the lungs of a non-smoker living in the city that can be seen from The Myth of the Human Body Museum. Those lungs were unhealthy, dirty and gray with black spots. The only pair of clean, white lungs were from the person who has lived his or her entire life in the mountain. I realized that even though I have never tried smoking, there is a huge possibility that my lungs look like that. I have lived in the city for 16 years now and I encounter all sorts of pollution I know of every single day of my life and to me, smoking is the most evident. Of course, I am not in favor of this but I can't help but deal with it quietly and just let the day pass without doing an action against it. This problem is hard to stop or avoid but it is still possible to do something to prevent this. Banning smoking in all restaurants in the country might be a good step towards smoke prevention. Who wants to be around disturbing gases while eating, anyway? Eating in a healthier environment assures us a good step towards lessening the danger to innocent people's health.",B1.2
"I agree because it gives students several opportunities. First and foremost, I believe that it gives students responsibilities and obligations that must be met. Then let's not forget that they are also getting real job experience. With the job experience makes money and also any additional job skills that are necessary to perform their tasks. What usually carries over into college is that they learn to prioritize their workloads, organize their studies so that they may assimilate information in a more orderly and easier to remember process. Unless they are stressed out, their ability to focus is usually more heightened and they tend to maximize their time more efficiently. When they leave college and their part-time jobs, they usually do so having acquired not just learning skills or information, but tools and techniques that will carry them in good stead regardless of what job they get. If by chance they should find themselves in between jobs, they may be able to seek different kinds of work that their skills base may be transferred to. We know that many skills are transferable and see this in the business world quite frequently so this should be no different in a newly graduated student's case.",C2
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. There are five reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, by doing part-time job, they can find earning money very hard. So, they use their money seriously. And the college students have much time. So if they want travel abroad, they can make money by doing part-time job for their own. Planning how to use money is helpful when they begin to work. Secondly, if they do a part-time job, they can meet people of variety generation, from children to senior adults. So they can know various people's way of thinking. Thirdly, the harder they do a part-time job, the more evaluated they are. For example, their salary per hour is maybe up. Fourthly, by doing many kinds of part-time job, they can know their suitable future job such as teaching children, or serve customs in shops, and so on. In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers. And they teach junior high school students studying. Lastly, they have responsibility for their job. It is an important thing when they work. As above, they can know society's basic rules. This is why I agree that college students have a part-time job.",A2
"I think Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is hazardous for human's life. But some of smokers are smoking in restaurant and damage for non smokers Usually outside of building or restaurant, smoking is not much uncomfortable for other people. But in the restaurant, smoking is very uncomfortable for non smokers. That's because of the cigarette smoke and ash. These are poisonous for people And non smoker's appetite will be decreases. Of this reason some restaurant made a smoking area and smoking only inside Smoking area and people smoking in that area Smoking area is intended for minimize damage for non smokers. It is made by glass and split two spares in restaurant. But smoking area can't proof all of non smokers. Cigarette smoke and ash is poisonous for people. Even smokers are smoke in smoking area. Cigarette smoke and ash are Not perfectly proofed for non smokers. The non smokers are forced to smoke because of these reasons Smoking area will be phase out and smokers must be smoking outside of restaurant But best way of restaurant smoke is quit the smoke. It is good for health and other peoples. Quit the smoke",B1.1
"I believe that smoking should not be banned in restaurants in Japan for the following three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not illegal in society, so what right does an individual establishment have to rewrite the rules that we all live by and accept? Certainly smoking can be frowned upon, but an outright ban borderlines on illegal. Smoking may make some people uncomfortable, much in the way that loud earphones or voluble cel-phone use on trains is irritating. However, can we ban such behaviour? Smoking is a behaviour, and restaurants do not have the right to police behaviour. Secondly, restaurants are ultimately businesses, and must serve the needs of customers in order to remain solvent. Currently, many people wish to smoke while they eat and drink, and for as long as that is the case, restaurants should provide spaces where this is possible. Certainly smoking sections are necessary in order to provide non-smokers with comfortable environments also; however, an outright ban merely seems draconian and unfair, and unworthy of a civilized democracy. Finally, there is the snowball issue: if we ban smoking due to health concerns, what will be next? Banning meat-eating if vegetarian lobbies gain the upper hand in the burgeoning health-craze? Or banning furniture made of wood if anti-forestry groups gain the upper hand? Banning smoking in restaurants is the beginning of a slippery slope, as self-interested lobbies begin to successfully steer public opinion to serve ultimately selfish, nonsensical and short-sighted goals.",C2
"Now, some restaurants have separated nonsmoking seats from smoking seats. But that is not effective if smoking is banned completely at restaurants. That is why we cannot stop smokes from cigarette from invading nonsmoking seats. As a result, the situation at nonsmoking seats is the same as that of smoking seats. Also, there are a lot of children or people who are not allowed to smoke. Smoking affects them badly by their seeing people smoke. For instance, they may snuff smokes or they may start smoking by seeing that often. In fact, the number of the children whose parents smoke smoking is mor e than that of the children whose parents don't smoke. And if the man couldn't help smoking, he might get out of a restaurant. In the first place, restaurants are not where people smoke or chat but where people enjoy eating dishes. People should concentrate enjoying eating or drinking. And smoking may prevent us from eating original tastes. In short, smoking may alter tastes. Then those who smoke cannot get anything at the restaurant. It is true that they relax by smoking, but, at restaurants, that doesn't bring them anything good, but that brings people around them criticizing.",B1.1
"Our students are not of equal standers. Some of them are poor some middle classed and some of them are very rich. Poor students have the equal right to study even if they are poor money are wise but not poor study wise. Infect they are more rich in knowledge then many of the rich students. So, these students due to poverty found it difficult to continue studies. In order to cope with it they do part time jobs for their expenses. Their parents are not in a position that they would afford their heavy fees. So, they do part time jobs as burden on their life. They are in order to fulfill their demand worked for job and they this affect their studies in a way that they get weak and their health fallen. If Government provides better facilities to them that they could easily continue their studies and do their job as well with honor then it is good for them but if they are left alone to do job at their own expense then it would be an extra demand then part time jobs are good if they are done with proper time management if they interferes with studies then they should not be done. If they left no other choice for you that you have to run your family and do your studies as well then it would be only choice to do job.

"I think college students should have a part-time job in their college life. It can learn a lot out of the class. For example, you can learn how to talk to the customer or hoe to face the problem you face. And you can earn money by your own. I think even school can teach you how to learn the math questions or how the history is, but it can teach you how to face the question in our daily life. Maybe someone will say, you can't learn a lot from part-time job, but I think the job can give you more than money. When I enter college, many people just study, study, and study. They didn't do anything out of class. I think it's not good, because they just know a part of school life, they didn't see more about world. In my college life, I did some part-time jobs. From cram school to restaurant, I think the experient is so great for me that I can't tell everyone. My boss also taught me a lot, because their experiences are more than me. I am glad to meet them, and I think I won't forget it until been an old woman. So I just know college students can learn a lot from part-time jobs, and if you don't forget you are a student, you will be great in your study and your part-time job life.",A2
"Smoking should be banned in restaurants due to some health reasons that can save a man's life. Imagine you are sitting in a restaurant and you don't enjoy your meal because of a gray smoke that is invading your face. Even though you don't want it you can still inhale it because of not banning smoking in a restaurant. Many Filipinos have experienced this kind of incident before, but due to lack of rules and regulations inside a restaurant you can't blame the person the person who is smoking. One more thing, smoking should be banned in restaurants because of the secondhand smoke that other people can inhale, which is more harmful to your health. Most of the restaurant bar that I have visited before has a separate space for the people who smoke so that the innocent lungs will not be involved. It is more appropriate rather than assembling it in a place. Even though you are not smoking, you can inhale it through the secondhand smoke. It should not just be banned in restaurants but it should also be banned in public places because the smoke of the cigarette can increase the pollution in our land. Restaurant isn't a place for smoking; it is a place for bonding and eating. According to Sarah Bernhardt, Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of your life. Dear Smokers, please stop smoking because if you don't stop, you are killing yourself.",B1.2

It is because most students have to find a job directly after their graduation and, at the beginning, students may choose their major just according to their academic results without thinking about which kind of jobs that they will mostly encounter after choosing that major. In other words, they may even know almost nothing about the nature of the job such as the working environment, hours etc. Hence it is necessary for students to have a try during their study so that they can decide whether they should change their major, and thus have more chances to equip themselves to match the jobs that they are interested in. Taking Civil Engineering as an example, it is a well-paid job requiring students to deal with many physics, mathematics, programming etc, and it has very great contributions to the society and the world. However, this does not mean that it is suitable for most students who like the above things since it requires students to work in construction site where not every students who love the about subjects can bear. Even students love the major that they are studying, there are various possible paths of that major just as the case in BBA. Part time job can thus provide more opportunities for them to know more different paths, and they will not be easily confused by the wide variety after their graduation. The exceptions are those who decide to have post-graduated study. Instead of working experiences, what they need more are academic results as well as research experiences. By the way, working experiences, part time jobs, are really important to the students since university is the final station before the society.",B1.2
"In my opinion the government should not ban the smoking in the public places especially in the restaurant. Firstly the cigarette manufacture has a high participation of making high income for the financial of our country, Indonesia. It is not only used for the government but also for fulfilling the needs of all aspects that are faced by the government, like education, housing, governor and many things. It means that decreasing the using of the cigarette will bring to the decrease of income also. And it will make Indonesia will be worst. Restaurant is one of the places that people are used to visiting to when they get bored. So they want to do something that will refresh their brain after having a lot of work activities. Based on research that conducted by one of the doctors, having smoking is able to make the body of the human being healthy. Furthermore, if the restaurant have the route that the visitors should hot smoking there, it will decrease the profit of the owner because the visitors will also decrease. Unemployment is one of the big problems that are faced by the government of Indonesia. When government decides to ban the using of smoking in public places especially in the restaurant, it will decrease the demand of the cigarette. It means that the production of the cigarette will also decreasing and the owner will fire the employment out. So that's why the number of unemployment will be increase. In brief, the government should not ban smoking in the public places especially restaurant because it has many disadvantages not only for the human but also for the government itself because the number of restaurant in Indonesia is very high.",B1.1
"When I go to a restaurant, I always see someone smoking. It is a very boring thing on account of I hate the smoke and the smell. Although almost people don't like smoking, but a part of people think smoking is their habit and we can't stop it. So there is a huge contradiction between these two types of people. On the one hand, almost people don't like smoking and they always think the smoking is bad for our health. When this type of people goes to the restaurant, they always get the second-hand smoking. it can affect the breath health with themselves. So this type of people supports to ban smoking at all the restaurants. On the other hand, smoker always think that smoking is their habit and it can't stop it very easily. Furthermore, the government supports the smoking because it is a big source of tax in finance. If we banned smoking at all the restaurants, it can decrease the selling of the cigarette. Generally speaking, to ban the smoking at all the restaurants is a difficult decision with the government. As the matter of fact, we should find a reasonable way to solve this problem. So now we cannot completely ban smoking in all the restaurants.",B1.1
"Part time job is very good job because get money and pay your free time for good thing. I usually do part time job in summer. Part time job is good experience for life. I can make money from part time job. You should make part time job for help your father and mother. I think part time job make one day is important more than in part. You will enjoy with your friends. Part time job make many friend and make happiness for life. I like part time job because it make a lot of money and more experience. I can use money from part time job pay for class myself. Part time job is a good activity for student from university or high school. You have many advantages. In this summer, I still want to work. I will find a part time job in a shopping mall. They pay very good and I meet many people. I have fun a lot. Some friend from part time job is very good. We still contact and help to find job. When someone have a good place to work, we will tell each other about a job. Money, experience, friend are a good thing from part time job. I support student to work. It's good to learn by working.",B1.1
"Smoking is a life-threatening habit, don't you agree? If it really affects human life, what is the point of still allowing smoking in public places? In light of this, I absolutely agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First of all, a restaurant looks like a closed box. Smoking in such place would definitely cause side effects on health. This is because breathing in second-hand smoke would spark off coughing. More seriously, bronchitis and asthma may also result under prolonged exposure to such smoke. Since health is the most essential element to human, banning smoking at all restaurants can help people to stay away from devil. Secondly, smoking is detrimental to air pollution. In order to tackle this problem, prohibiting smoking at restaurants can eliminate one of the emission sources of smoke. Although it only helps little compared to tens of thousands of smokers all around the street, it at least can remedy the situation by reducing the places available for smokers to emit waste gas. Last but not least, people usually do not enjoy taking in second-hand smoke. Limiting smoking can make the atmosphere in restaurants better as the smelly gas would make the food taste worse psychologically. As a result, the reputation of the restaurant would be ruined. On the contrary, without such smoke, it becomes more enjoyable to eat inside the restaurant and can thus attract more customers. So it is really necessary to ban smoking at all restaurants. In view of above reasons, forbidding smoking would undoubtedly call for prompt action. In absence of smoke, health can be improved, pollution can be relieved and thus customers can enjoy their meals in the restaurants. Therefore, there is no doubt that completely disallowing people to smoke at restaurants is a correct practice.",B1.2
"Many students these days take up a part-time job in order to earn some extra pocket money for themselves. Youngsters these days have extremely high expenditure, and a part-time job would allow them to support their high cost of living. This is especially common during the long school holidays. Secondary school students would resort to being waitresses at restaurants, or even help out at IT fairs. Junior College students and undergraduates, on the other hand, are more commonly known to take up tuition assignments. For some undergraduates, taking up a part-time job even becomes a necessity, as the tuition fees for universities are extremely costly. However, it would be less of a necessity for college students as the school fees are still heavily subsidized by the government. There are pros and cons of taking up a part-time job. For instance, taking up tuition assignments is a good source of income with a flexible timing, however, this would also mean having to give up the time that could otherwise be spent on studying or doing projects. Students should weigh the pros and cons of taking up a part-time job. Earning extra income to support their expenses would indeed lessen their parents' burden, however, this should not come at the expense of their grades and studies. Afterall, students being students should still put their studies as top priority. Therefore, it is good that college students take up a part-time job, but it is definitely not as important as the focus they should place on their studies. ",B1.2
"Absolutely I agree with the point. Restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smokes will destroy the warm atmosphere. And this also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that whether smoke depend on personal preferences, this is selfish behavior. It will make other people be unhealthy. The important thing is smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like those people who smoke in public place. As is known to all, smoking just make people increase the risk of cancer. And those second-hand smokers will be more influenced than smokers. Especially in public places, smokes are extremely harmful. Smokes are poison gas. If there is no one smokes in restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokes give up smoking so it is also benefit for them. A professor called Peter in HK university saidï¼‚one cigarette can kill at least 50 miceï¼‚. You know, smoking just make people feel boring but no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this well themselves. We have an obligation to make people more health life.",A2
"Should smoking be banned at all the restaurants? These day, many public place ban the smoking. This policy may be good for the nonsmoker. But in case of smoker, it may be inconvenient and unfair situation. However, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. And there are two reasons for that. Smoking is harmful for nonsmokers too. So nonsmokers can be damaged their health although they do not smoke. It is very serious problem for nonsmoker. And if smoker smoke near at nonsmoker and then nonsmoker feel one's heartbeat faster or have cough suddenly, it is responsible for the smoker that. And many nonsmokers don't like the smell of the cigarette. So especially at restaurant, the smell of the cigarette can make people's appetite diminished. And it is bad manner of the public place. Therefore smokers should consider the nonsmoker at the public station like the restaurants. Smoking can make nonsmoker unpleasant and harm the nonsomker's health. So although smoker feels some inconvenience for the policy, they should avoid smoking at all the restaurants.",B1.2
"I have tried to work since I graduated from senior high school, not only on vacation but the time I studied for my exam. There are no other reasons just the one I am poor. I have to earn my life by looking for part-time job and doing well. Actually, my free time is almost gone. When I leave my school, I have to run to my office. I tried telephoning at cram schools or standing on the street all afternoon for distributing my dm. I have little time to join my friends' action. I left the ball team because I could not handle it. Sometimes I hated that I have to work, but now I find new fun on my part-time job. I can practice my talking skills during being a waitress, and I can be a friend with many other students like me, and I learn many experiences that I can't learn in school. However, I find my way to balance both between my school and my job. I can use my time well to do each thing. I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because not everyone can handle both in his college life. But if you have the business, you can train yourself and gain achievement in different area. It's useful for your future work.",B1.1
"I agree with this idea of 'It is important for college students to have a part-time job.' It is because it is necessary for college student to be independent of their parents. These days they are a lot of people who completely depend on their parents. This is against the law of human. They are given money without working and they do not have responsibility for everything. Today, this is one of the charactaristic problems in Japan and this problem hove become more and more serious. I think the solution of this problem is to have a job no matter how easy it is. It is important to have a job. In my case, this year I have started to live alone and I have a part-time job. I did not realize the importance of independent of my parents and of responsibility for something until I have a part-time job. I am working at restaurant. In that place all what I did is responsible for me and the money I earned from that job become a lot of items whichi is necessary for my life. I become careful when I use my money. I believe I am a little independent of my parents. Thus, I think to have a part-time job is important for college students.",B1.1
"In recent years, we see more and more people smoke everywhere in public places like street, supermarkets, restaurants, and so on. Some people think we should ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country. Opinions of whether it should be banned in restaurants vary from person to person. First of all, as far as we know, smoking is bad for our health; Health body is our capital for struggling live, if we don't have healthy body, how can we live our life to the full? So you eat and smoke together in the restaurants, it is very harmful. More importantly, if you smoking in restaurant, it will influence other people where closed to you, these people who will have an uncomfortable feeling while he smelled this taste. They come to restaurants to have a good meal, not to smell cigarette smoke. We must put other's thoughts in our hearts, and can't leave the public behind. Most important, some people think that restaurants are comfortable places for those people who are busy all the days around. But the thoughts of others who can't live with smokes can't be over emphasized. Perhaps, to solve this issue is not easy at all, but it's worth trying. We should do our best, such as hold a speech in public announce that the disadvantage for smoking or do some more Public service advertising to improve the present situation. The government set a rule to force people smoke outside of the restaurants. I do believe it will be better in the future.",B1.1
"Smoking has been known to be very harmful to respiratory organs, and it is pointed as the main cause of cancer. However, tens of thousands of people are smoking still, because they have been addicted already. Thus, it is important to provide a strong opportunity to quit the smoking. People are smoking to relieve their stress, but it's not the good solution because it can bring the bigger problem like lung cancer. Further, it can harm to other people who don't smoke, because when smoking people breathing out, the ingredients contained in the smoke can affect the other people. In other word, people can die for smoking. However, the problem is that it is not easy to quit the cigarette. How can we pull them up from smoking? How can we save them from smoking? We can use the strategy of punish, and one of punish can be banning smoke at all the restaurants in the country. It can decrease the chances of smoke happening, because they will pay a pretty penny when they don't follow the regulation. Helping them by banning the smoke seems too progressive, but it could be an appropriate solution to help them move out from the addiction. Moreover, we can use the fine collected from the smokers to help other poor people. In sum, I agree to make a restrict zone in our life zone.",B2
"Smoking is a bad activities or us, because with a cigarette smoking only, can make our healthy drop. Smoking become a part of modern live, in reality smoking can a enter the disease to come in our body. For example : lung cancer, to damage a mouth, tooth and then our heart. We can feel a bad condition if we are consume a cigarette. For an active smoking, smoke to go out can be serious damage, because this smoke very dangerous for our health and for the negative smoking this smoke still dangerous too. The composition of cigarette are nicotine, tar, fenol, benzoperon. For a worker this activities must be reduce a productivities working and can trouble a work. For a women, can be damage a fetus and many problem to come for a pregnant women. In many countries, this activities was stopped for care a world from the pollution. We realize that activities make our healthy still drop or even death and we must therefore stop it for support this activities. And for our government we can be give a socialization for the young generation, for hope to don't do it or to minimalize the pollution, because any problem produce from cigarette to damage everyone.",B1.1
"Smoking is very harmful for all. Smoking now-a-days is very common. Everyone especially our young generation seems to be smoking everywhere. Every city, every street, at every corner young boys are seen to smoking. It has defected all. it is very dangerous for health. It causes cancer & heart patients. It damages our lungs & Breathing problems. The smoke of cigarettes is not only dangerous for smokers but also for the people sitting around the smokers. When smoke goes direct from the mouth or nose it firsts effects our throats due to which we cause throat infections, stomach problems, lungs problems & cancer etc. it is damaging life of many people. The young generation except of being support of their parents. Smoking has very badly affected the whole young generation. It is not only loss of health but also loss of money. Old people are also very badly affected by smoking. Due to this bad habit of smoking many new healthy problems are created. Government should take a strictly action against smoking. They should banned the smoking companies & and should fine the smokers. The shops which sales the cigarette should be closed by government if we want to improve our healthy problems & young generation.",B1.1
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is the activity of smoking cigarettes of tobacco and is associated with health risks such as lung cancer. Majority of the population does not smoke and most people dislike the odour and smoke from cigarettes. However, to ban it completely at all restaurants is too extreme an action. The concern over smoking in restaurants is due to non-smoking patrons' irritation and discomfort over the smoke while they dine. Dining is supposed to be a relaxing and enjoyable affair and their experience would be marred by the activities of smoking patrons. However, to place such a blanket ban on all restaurants would be very unfair to smokers. It is also impractical as smokers would simply move outside the restaurant or somewhere nearby to carry out smoking. This defeats the purpose of non-smoking patrons wanting to avoid the smoke created by smoking. I believe that the onus should be on restaurants, and they should formulate their own policy on smoking. Restaurants could partition their dining area into smoking and non-smoking areas, or not differentiate the area at all, depending on its clientele. For example, a family restaurant would be more likely to ban all smoking activities in its restaurant in consideration of the presence of young children. Conversely, a restaurant that caters mostly to wealthy clients and working class patrons would be more sensitive and tolerant of the activities of their patrons in order to ensure their continued patronage. Ultimately, the action to ban smoking at all restaurants would only be effective if coupled with more stringent smoking policies such as the ban of smoking in all public areas. Otherwise, I believe that such an action should be considered and decided by the involved restaurants. ",B2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. They should try to understand our society more and more. So they can know a part of this society to have a part-time job. Now I have a part-time job. I work at kaiten sushi in Osaka. I work there for half of year, but I could know many things. The things I knew are three subject. First, I could know importance of the money to stand on my own feet. Before than now, I have received money from my parents. In those days, I thought it is a little. So I always thought that I want to get much money. Now I work to get much money. So I can do many things. But I understand to get a lot of money is very very difficult!! Second, I can communicate many kind of people. In my college, I am not able to communicate varies people, because the college students are similar. But in my workplace, there are many kind of peple. For example, the one man is high school student. And the one woman is musician. And the other man is the elderly. Finally, part-time job is not real bussiness. So schoolwork and a part-time job are compatible with each other. College students must study the first. So a part-time job is the best work.",A2
"I think that they forbit our smoking in restaurants. I have three reasons. Firstly, smoking is not healthy. It is known that one cigarettes shortens our life seven minutes. A fact that the smoke of cigarettes injure our health is proved scientifically with today's medicine. Smokes don't stay outdoors. But, smoke is filled indoors such as in restaurants. So, it makes people do'nt want to smoke smoke. A number of people don't like smoke of cigarettes. So, in restaurants, a lot of people dislike smoke of cigarettes too. It is hated by many people who don't want to smoke. It is not good fact morally. Secondly, cooks want us to enjoy their cooking with all of our senses. We enjoy cooks with firstly eye, secondly noses, thirdly touch, fourthly tongue, finally ears. If it smelled smoke of cigarettes in restaurants the good smells of cooking is made by cooks is spoiled. Thirdly we should enjoy not cigarette but tasting delicious cooking or funny conversations with friends or family. Their smoking time prevents us from enjoying those pleasure. When we were in restaurants, we had better enjoy the atmosphere in restaurants as much as we can. And so, I think they should not smoke in restaurants",A2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because we can get a lot of techniques and knowledge through part-time job. After we get a job, they sometimes helpful to our job. Now, I am working part-time in sushi shop. There, Owner usually says that fine greeting and smile are very important. We must think most about guest. Under employment, it is not changed. Also, recently NEET is increasing. I do not think they are not going to get a job, but they have anxiety about technique and knowledge of jobs. They once have a part-time job, the anxiety may be cleared. Therefore NEET will be decreased. Decreasing NEET is good for future of Japan. So, I think part-time job is good for college students. In fact, through working as part-time job, I am developed. For example, a year ago, I am very shy. I could not speak stranger. But now I am able to speak stranger, of course guest. Also before I begin part-time job, I did not smile very much. But in the sushi shop I forced smile. Now my smile has increased in my daily life. Last reason is that through part-time job, we can meet a lot of people. He or she may be best friend or partner of our life. Talk with their, we can get new knowledge. It is important for college students to have a part-time job for these reason.",A2
"At present, in many restaurants have a smoking room and no-smoking room. But no-smoking person see the smoke scene in smoking room. No-smoking person feel bad because hate smoking. Indirect smoking is bad for everyone. In restaurant, people eat food and talk with friends or family. Smoking person doesn't have to smoke in restaurant. Nowadays wherever we go, we can find people smoking even it is prohibited to smoke. Many countries are trying to stop people from smoking in restaurant and have some rules. I think it is a good rule. There are several lessons that I support this rule. In some countries, people are no longer allowed to smoke in many public place and restaurant. Restaurants are the places where many people are eating or staying around. The places have to be comfortable and very clean. If people start to smoke, the places might be full of smoke and the non-smokers would feel unpleasant. There would be full of cigarettes smell and left over cigarettes all over the floor. By this, numerous people who are summing to the places would not have pleasant time and good rest. This cigarette smoking can affect non-smokers It has been already found that cigarette smoking is much bad for the non-smokers. Second hand smoking is breathing in the smoke from other people's cigarettes.",B1.2
"It is fairly well that smoking in the restaurant is a bad behave which harms both the health of the smoker and others in the restaurant. But from my point of view, forbid it completely is impossible. Suppose smoking is completely banned at all in the restaurant people may smoke outside it and then get into. Then the provisions will with no meaning. It is well known that even though the tax of cigarettes is very high, the number of people who smoke is still very high. Therefore, forbidding smoking in all the restaurant is not a fundamental method to make people away from cigarettes. Moreover, the restaurants in china are of different levels. And people in china also have different level of education. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, there will be a lot of people who can't understand it and it will also have a bad influence on those small restaurants. Considering the possible consequence above, I think it is reasonable to forbid smoking in high-grade restaurants, but forbidding smoking in all the restaurants at all is unrealistic and not feasible.",B1.1
"I don't agree that it's important for college students to have a part time job, besides they must. Taiwan's education is not similar to U. S; we don't have many vary choice to choose which one we like or want to touch in school. Only in college, we choose many way to learn, even you are not major the department, you also can choose the class of other departments. In college, you can touch many vary things, and you can control what time you want to go to school except major classes. How many classes you have touched? Except major classes, you have much time to do you want to do, you might want to rest instead of in class all day, you can use the time to swim or do some sports. How long will you stay in college? General students are 4 years in Taiwan, you spend one third times of 4 years to major classes, and more than one third to other classes, the rest of time is not much to you to do anything you want to realize deeply. Sometimes, you thought money is most important to your life, but, to my opinion, learning is really the most important.",B1.1
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. I think that college is not only a place where we study but also where we make humanity. Humanity is made when we have communication. And a part-time job is a good chance which we have a communication. So I agree with a part-time job. However, there are many kind of part-time job. Not all part-time jobs have a good effect on us. So we have to choose a part-time job carefully. I think that there are three conditions of a good part-time job. First is money. Most of us have a part-time job to get money. If we can get a lot of money, we will call it a good job. Second is a member of the job. Good communication requires good members. If there are people who don't have humanity, probably you are unwilling to be concerned with him or her. As a result, you can't have communication. Third is detail of the job. It is important that we choose a job that we can use our advantages. For example, People who are good at communication should choose the jobs which have many communications. And it is also good that people who are poor at choose the jobs as a practice. In the end, experiences of a part-time job have a good effect on us. So college students should have a part-time job.",A2
"I consider myself as someone who is health conscious. Every time I walk past smokers, I always remember to pull out my handkerchief and cover my nose, or in some instances, hold my breath for a few seconds. According to studies second hand smoking is much more dangerous than first hand. That is why it is important to ban smoking in restaurants. Think about it, if you inhale second hand smoke, you sustain more damage than the first hand smoker. Most smokers tend to smoke inside or outside restaurants, usually with their friends. This must stop. There are a lot of customers which the restaurants attend to, not only adults but children as well. It would be wrong if children, at a tender age, would inhale the second hand smoke of the smokers in restaurants. Smoking shall be banned in restaurants, for it will affect the health condition of the other customers that are being served. These customers may not fully realize that their health condition is already suffering from second hand smoking. A good approach to this problem, would be requiring smokers to move in private areas were their actions would not harm other individuals. Therefore, other customers would no longer be affected by the serious case of second hand smoking.",B1.2
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students only study but also experiment a lot of situation. A part-time job has the things that I do not get in the college life. I talk about me. I have the part-time job in Book off. I learned a lot of things. For example, I learned that being said Thank you is more pleasant than I think. I learned importance of money and do not use little money than the time which I am a high school student in. I learned how to use correct Japanese languages and how to deal with a register. I communicated with all kinds of people and I increased the chances that I talked with old people in. I knew a lot of things and I increased friends. If I do not have part-time job, I do not learned a lot of things and increased the time which I do nothing. But, I think that it is bad to work part-time too much and not to study. I think that a working student should work part-time moderately. So, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",A2
"In the old times, smoking is maybe the symbol of aged, cultured men. Now, with the widespread planting of tobacco, every grown-ups especially male, are tend to smoke. Some of them are addict to cigarettes, so they smoke everywhere, including in public places. However, I think smoking in public places should not be allowed. First, smoking is not a good manner to others, if you always pouring out smelly smoke while others feel sick, you must be unpopular. Secondly, smoking now mainly plays the role in social interaction, not just make someone feel satisfied. Also, cigarette has a lot of harmful chemicals that will hurt your body. Every cigarette box has a sign reminding you not to smoke too much outside. In public places, people need a quiet, comfortable environment. Smoking can make one excited like coffee do, to some extent. So smoking can affect all people around you and have a bad influence. That's why I oppose to smoking in public. I think every public place should have a smoking area. This action can not only release the smokers' pressure, but also create a good environment in public places, like the old saying goes Kill two birds with one stone.",B1.1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons I think so. By the way I have a part-time job. I wrote reasons which base on my experience of part-time job. At first, I can have a experience of society by having a part-time job. When we do something, we have commitments. In part-time job, I feel it strongly. We can't get money easily. I did hare work and then I could get money. I can learn importance of money. We, university student, can change part-time jobs so we can be a man who sale bread or clothes and then be a man who deliver news paper or pack or a man cook crape or okonomiyaki, teacher of private school, a shop boy of first food or coffee shop and so on If we were thirteen years old, could we change the jobs easily? I think the answer is no. Changing jobs is not easy for a businessman. Second reason is that we can meet many people at part-time job. I made friends with many people at part-time job and some one go to different university, some one is different age, some one is from different part of Japan. If I didn't start part-time job, I would never meet some of them. Things talked by different university student or different age person are very interesting to me. I can know what I have never known. Third reason is that getting money refers to help my parents and we can get money to do what I want to do by getting money. I can buy books and clothes, bags. It follows from this three reasons that I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",A2
"About being in a restaurant about smoking is a problem. Restaurant as well as smoking in all public areas must be. If you do not think that is enjoyable to yourself. Passive smoking and risk of harm to others illustrates. The perils of secondhand smoke A lot of people who do not know it, you need to stop smoking in public places and restaurants to think. Nice and tasty food to eat are we doing when we smoked at the next table will be happy. If you feel bad to do good to each other's it do not think it. And you want a pleasant atmosphere in any restaurant. However, a side table filled with smoke from a cigarette you will feel if you do not want get into a restaurant. Cigarette smoke is harmful to children and the elderly too much. Damage compensation if we go to them, how would you do? To do this requires non-smoking. And the smoke itself is harmful to the body of rotting lungs. So these are my thoughts. Booking agent for the health of each other in order to agree that smoking in restaurants. Thanks for listening, in my opinion is an awful lot.",A2
"There is no denying that smoking is harmful to us. Not only does it pose a great harm to the smoker, but also affect the non-smoker's health nearby. For instance, smoking has been proved to cause lung cancer, heart disease and other respiratory disease in that every cigarette contains more than a hundred chemical compounds and most of them are poisonous to our body. In view of this, Government should propose banning smoking in some public area, and sepecially, at all resturant. If you are on the street and you find that someone is smoking in the neighboring area, then you can choose to get away from that area and rescue yourself. However, when you are having meals in a resturant, it is not easy to get away immediately. You need endure to smoke passively. But we are indeed innocent! We also have the right to enjoy fresh and clean air but this right is deprived by smokers who gain pleasure at the expense of others. Also, banning smoking in restaurants may have a prospective increase in the group of patrons who do not smoke. Afteer all, the proportion of non-smokers is still larger than that of smokers. In conclusion, I do support banning smoking in all restaurants.",B1.2
"I, who don't smoke, completely agree with that. In my opinion, smoking don't bring any benefit, it's totally a bad thing. Smoker shouldn't smoke in the restaurant. In restaurants, it's hard for them to have completely separated smoking and non-smoking sections. If one person smokes, then everyone around him has to breathe it. Also, the waitresses in a smoky bar or restaurant will suck entire boxes of cigarettes just from breathing the dirty air. For people who don't smoke, it's hard to stand it. Maybe people who smoke will think that it's nothing. But for people like me, we don't smoke; we think smoke is really stinky. Furthermore, when we suck the second hand smoke they produce, we may have higher risk to get cancer. Smoking is bad for our health. When people smoke, the smoke they produce will also cause air pollution. Everyone wants to have a good environment when having meals. I think people shouldn't smoke when having meals. We should ban this in the country. Having meals is a pleasure thing. But when people smoke during that time, I think most people won't feel good. It's really important to ban this in the restaurants. I totally agree with that.",B2
"Nowadays in Japan people tend to dislike the tobacco. There are a bunch of places where smoking is prohibited. For instance in hotels, on streets, at colleges and not only in trains but also on platform. So only at restaurants smoking is not banned that is strange. Smoking should be thoroughly forbidden at all the restaurants. One of the reasons is that if many smoking people are in the restaurants, we would feel its atmosphere to be not good. A restaurant is a place where we have a good meal and where we spend time comfortably. Secondly some of customers who come to the restaurants are family. Sometimes the family has the babies. To babies tobacco's smoke is very bad. The restaurants should make visiting all families very happy. So smoking ought not to be allowed. Nowadays the rules of Japan gradually begin to be rigid. But they are not stricter than the rules of Singapore, America, United Kingdom and France. There smoking is almost prohibited. For instance if we are in one of the countries, it is natural that we don't watch a TV commercial. And if we walk there, we would don't look the advertisements on streets. Japan should imitate these.",B1.1
" In recent years, more and more public places such as some restaurants and pubs announced a ban on smoking. This tendency attracts much attention and caused a social debating. Many people especially those smokers think this limit their legal rights and require no ban for smoking. But more people agree on it. I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but do you know that living with a smoker is even more harmful? The scientific research shows that the second-hand smoke is much more harmful than smoke a cigarette directly. So smoking in public places can do harm to others health. So in my opinion, no smoking in public places is fair and legal. The second point is that smoking in public can have bad influence especially on young people. Children lack the ability of judgment and like to imitate adults. So they are more likely to smoke when they grow up or even before they grow up. Ban on smoking can teach them a good lesson: smoking is bad, don't touch it. Smoking in public places is dangerous. It can set things on fire and cause disasters. Many people lost their lives because of a cigarette. According to these reasons, I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. No smoking makes a healthier and more harmonious society.",B1.1
"I agree with the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in country. This way is not respect for smoker. Smoker have a free of smoking. And we have not right to take away smoker's freedom. But the freedom need to responsibility. Smokeing is very not good our health. Smoke is very not good for health not only smoker but also non smoker. Smoking causes lung cancer and any other disease. If one smoker smoking in the restaurants, all the people in the restaurants are get a damage. Once the health is poor, then it is very hard to return to good. So smoker is not responsible at the smoking's damage. If the smoker have a lot of money, the health is don't change the money. And the smoking when you eating something is very unpleasent. So if you eating very delicious food where the smoker is smoking in restaurants, you not taste the food well. You will think just get off the smoking spot. I think the damage of non smokers is bigger then the discomfortable of the smokers. So the smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. Although they have discomfortable on the restaurants.",B2
"I think this is It is good for students to have part-time jobs. I think this is very common that students do part-time jobs while studying in foreign universities. It's obvious that if you don't work, you will have more time to study, but doing a job can get you some income to survive or get some pocket money without depending on parents. Research has shown that those students who work while studying tend to understand and grasp their studies much better than those who are not on job. They understand the nature of business and get a practical learning about how things are done. For example if a student is studying telecommunications and works at a call center, he will understand each and every thing much better. However students working while studying should definitely not divert from their studies and keep a balance between their studies as well as job. Types of part-time jobs that students at University of Florida do includes Child care, landscaping/maintaining garden/gardener, swim lesson instructor, house cleaning, tuition (tutor), office assistant, management assistant, delivery jobs, lifeguard, sales assistant, recreation assistant, web designers, violinist/musician, mailing letters, dishwasher, IT technical assistants, tour guides, book keeper, delivery work, receptionist, creative writers, drivers, photographers, graphic designers.",A2
"When college life starts, students enter in a new phase of life. College life is quite different from school life. Moreover the expenditures are too increased. Some of the parents can not afford the academic expenditures, so, they do not permit their children to get education. But students with good academic records and those who are keep to get educated, they start part time jobs, to fulfil their expenditures along with studies. But, I totally disagree to it. Though on one hand, its useful that in a way students can help out their parents, even though, I disagree with this, because students are the main pillars society. They are the backbone of our progress. So, they should give their full time and potential to studies. If they, start part time jobs, then no doubt, it would be rather more difficult for them to manage both their jobs and studies. In this way they couldn't give their best in any one of them. Infect, they will be tired and frustrated. The timing work will exhaust them and they will fail to cope with their studies. As a result they will be in-efficient and will show worse results in college. The life of a students is the golden time of their life. It is the time, when they have wishes because they are not nature rough. They wanted to plunge onto the starts. So, they should not include in part time jobs. Infect, they should have fours on their goal.",B1.2
"It is great delima of our age is that the numbers of smokers are increase in our country. The person who is addicted of smoking cannot get rid of from his habit. Where, he fined a lonely place he started smoking. He is totally ignorant from the danger of smoking for him his fellow beings. A great and danger aspect of smoking is the use of smoking in hotels and near the food place. The smoke of cegrate spoiled the food items and when, we eat it cause many disease. Smoking not only harmful for him but also harmful for the citizen of the country. Smoker spread the durty and poisious smoker all around them. Vegetable fruit and other food items and the has a natural capesity to obsoube the dangers gasses, which smokers spread in the atmosphere. It is our moral duty to keep safe our hotels restaurant and other foods shops from these smokers. It is government responsibility to ban the use of smoking and tabackoo in the country specially in the hotels and food places. Due to act upon these principles we can reduce the great chance of many great diseases because it is the big cause of pollution specially food production.",B1.1
"The cigarette is one kind drug. It have a smoke of toxin. Smoking can make no good health and bad character. Then if we are smoking everyday, it can be cancer then a long time if we are not smoking, we can died. So I agree is smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because In the restaurants have people so much, such as have a youngers, a womens, a adults and etc. and in the restaurants is the public where and relaxing where then in the restaurant is family go to dine. If some have a smoker cannot stop smoking, some have a people became cancer and not good health because they are breathe smoke in them body. The smoking ban in restaurants will help restaurant customers more as well because it will make people believe that the ride will not smoke to interfere and prohibit smoking Breeze restaurant considered the ethics of society. People should have time to sit eating. Nowadays if some have who smoking in the restaurants or a public where is false law and Penalty. So if Smoker love family and want to be good health not sickness, Smoker should be stop the smoking and exercise, eat vegetable everyday.",B1.1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Recently the entire world starts to find the problem of smoking. Smoking has a lot of disadvantage, such as, making your lungs worst and worst, your mouth smell bad and the worst of all is when you are smoking you will hurt yourself and people around you at the same time! In addition, once you get into the habit of smoking, you will spend a lot of time to quit this habit and finally you may feel it too difficult so give up quickly! To stop smoking continue being a threat to people, completely banned it at all the restaurants in the country is necessary. As everybody know smoking has threat our health many years, and we should improve this problem as soon as possible! Many reports have proved that people who get lungs cancer more than a half is that they have a family get into the habit of smoking. It means that many people are cursed by people smoking around them. So, in order to improve this problem, I think the first step is to use the law to ban these people smoking in the public place. Although this way can't help people quit smoking, it can help many people who hate the smell and protect our health at least.",B1.1
"It is necessary for college student to have part-time job. First, through the experience of part-time job, they can find their aptitude for their future career. Let's suppose there is a college student who is interested in running restaurant. If she works in a restaurant or a firm as a part-timer and has a chance to see the real business situation very closely, she can reflect it to her process of job decision more easily. Second, doing a part-time job can help college student developing social skills such as communication strategy, making good relationship with strangers, and teamwork. Although a student works for a trivial part comparing to the entire process in her part-time job, such as photocopying, cleaning, or typing, she should have a sense of responsibility and cannot help communicating with other people. Third, doing part-time job leads college students to be independent economically from their family. Considering the fact that they are adults and member of the society, they need to be independent from the parents care. In the light of this, as a first step for being a real adult, money-making is needed for the students. For this three reasons, it is very good chance for college students to have part-time job.",B2
"Part time job Nowadays, most people have a lot of problem such as financial problem, poverty, drug problem etc. But the important problem that make many people difficult to live in today is unemployment problems. According to in the present that we can find a lot of person that have unemployment problem because they can't find job or the faculty which they graduated wasn't wanted in the labor market. So many people choose to find other job that they don't expert or not related to their faculty that they graduated. This kind of job is called Part time job. Part time job is the way to get money for people who really can't find job and want to spend the free time for the most benefit.

"Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants in all countries. Firstly it is because smoking is not only bad for smoking peoples' health but also other's. I heard that there are 15 harmful substances in tobacco and it is also bad for second-hand smoking people. Secondly, it makes some people's appetite drop. I also have experiences that I couldn't enjoy my dishes because of odd smells from smoking people. And smoking in restaurants encroaches the rights for ordinary people to eat foods in clean place. Of course smoking people also have rihgts to smoke in some places but it shouldn't encroach others' rights. To be fair to the two sides of people, I think the restaurant should divide smoking and non-smoking room definitely. However, in usual restaurants it isn't kept perfectly so non-smoking rooms also smell disgusty. If restaurants can separate the room, they don't need to ban smoking people. But they can't, I think the definite law that smoking isn't permitted in restaurants should be made.",B2
"I think that most people would agree that having a part-time job is a good option for a student. I've had a part-time job since my first semester of college and I have learned a lot from working there. Most of my friends complain that they do not want to find any part time job because they are already very busy with their schoolwork and their social lives. It is true that having a part-time job sometimes makes it difficult to find time to do everything that you want or need to do, but putting yourself in situations in which you're a little bit uncomfortable is one of the best ways to grow and become stronger as a person, student, and an employee. What's more, by having a part-time job I can make enough money to fund all of my personal expenses such as food, rent, and entertainment. The fact of the matter is that my friends who do not have money cannot have as much fun as I have or have as much freedom as I have. It sometimes seems sad, but money really is power. If you have a part-time job, you can make money, you can gain skills, and you can make professional contacts.",C2
"I agree with this statement for several reasons. Smoking has been proven many times to have a large impact on the health of people, including smokers themselves and those around them. It is absurd to allow people to inflict damage in the form of passive smoking upon others who choose not to smoke. Each year there are numerous cases of health problems caused by second hand smoke which impacts the economy due to increased health expenditure from the government. It is therefore necessary to take steps to reduce these issues as much as possible, and banning smoking in all restaurants is a step to achieving that. Enclosed spaces facilitate the spread of smoke and of course restaurants are enclosed spaces yet it is not just restaurants where it should be banned ? all indoor public places should be no-smoking areas much like several countries in Europe and parts of America. Focusing on restaurants, it is not only the health aspect we should consider. There is also the issue of hygiene and pollution. Smoking is a dirty habit. The ash spreads easily, potentially contaminating food at worst, or being a mild nuisance at best. The smoke itself has an unfavorable odor for non-smokers and smokers alike. The smell of tobacco while eating can be enough to ruin the appetite of a 40-a-day chain-smoker let alone a non-smoker. It is therefore in the best interests of restaurant owners to encourage the image of cleanliness in their establishments by banning smoking.",C2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it can make people around who that smoking get dangerous material that can make who smell smoke intake to the body and make them are many cancers. Moreover, I think the most people do not like the person that smoking because it has very bad smell and dangerous for the internal organs in body. The person which one that smoking is like damage them family and the persons that they love. Especially, the result that will happen to them most and there are smell and yellow nail because somking always can make bad material destroy them internal organs and it can make the person that smoking look more old than age. Smoking can make a lot of disease as soon as they will die. Nowadays, there are the person that increase smoking so we should turn to campaign or ban it for protect who do not smoking if we can do it, we will happy and good healthy.

"Nowadays, many people smoking cigarettes. But most of the smokers are high school students. Smoking is really harmful for teenagers and matures. Cigarettes are bad for your health and are not good mentally. Cigarettes are the cause of various illnesses such as cancers, and impotents. And cigarettes smokers know that already. And cigarette smokers give a negative sight. But smoking is not only bad for you. Cigarette smokers can have a joy at it and give a benefit to the nation because the price of the cigarettes has state tax. And cigarettes also become a favorite food for the smokers. You can choose to smoke if you want. I think to say STOP SMOKING is not good idea. If the smoker does not give damage for another people, I think we need not to say like that. We can make them a lot of smoking area for the smoker and the nonsmoker. I smoke cigarettes too. But my father said it will be good for you that cutting the cigarettes. So I am considering quitting cigarette. I think if I quit it, I can save my money and my health. Thank you for reading my essay and I will study hard in English.",A2
"For me, not that much unless you're really in need of the money that you can earn while having a part-time job. I do not agree completely because mainly you're studying, and in my opinion you only have to focus on your studies, having a part-time job can be very stressful, because you'll need to balance your studies as well as your job, I have friends that has a part-time job and at the same time studying and seeing them sleeping in the class makes me think that it is not really advisable that college students should really have a part time job, it can be done while having your summer vacation, because college students doesn't need to wake up very early to attend classes every summer plus you can have your own hard-earned money in summer, I 'm not saying that having a part time job is bad but I think it is not just advisable for college students like me, but if the need arises like if my parents can't afford to send me to my university anymore then maybe that's the time that I will consider having a part-time job, the same reason goes to the other college students like me.",B1.2
"I agree because the restaurant is what Each individual person or family to family to eat together. Happy to do business or otherwise. If the restaurant is smoke will cause the atmosphere to shop completely free atmosphere. Restaurants and considered to be one of cleanliness. Restaurants need to focus on cleaning because of health related to the customer if the restaurant where the smoke when Customers come to the restaurant would be something bad back too, and may result in the body of the restaurant to eat healthy is not good. A cornerstone of the restaurant will give customers the impression that Must depend on many things. The taste is delicious and it Environmental atmosphere shop must be good. To attract customers into the store when customers will feel comfortable and all ages to focus. So, the restaurant should not smoke to interfere with the dining customers. It can cause health damage as a customer. Elderly, we should respect each other. And sometimes may be residual smoke into the food if you are smoking in the restaurant. Finally, anti-smoking in restaurants that Deemed to be correct and proper place because the restaurant is a place People that want to use something good. Not want the bad So who will enter the restaurant should consider whether the action should be what And considering that the penalty for smoking in restaurants would be wrong because it would destroy the healthy people.",A2
"Millions of people in this world are the great smokers. It is true that everyone have rights to do anything what they want to do, but in the condition that ""the things"" mustn't disturb other's rights. That's why people should not smoke in the public area where there has a lot of people. Restaurant for example, there is no way for the smoke to pass through from inside out. And of cause, smoking creates a lot of pollution. The smoke as a pollutant is extremely hazardous to human body. It makes we breath harder also effected to our eyes too. People who breath the in smoking area oftenly have a higher risk to get the lung cancer, because the chemical compounds in cigarette are poisonous. Do we want our children live in the higher risk to the bad illness? The risk that they may loose their parents before the right time? Now it's the appropriate time to start the new era. Smoking should be completely banned in all over public area such as restaurant, garden , school or even in the office. It's time for revolution!",B1.2
"Smoking does not just have ill-effects on the smoker, it is a public health hazard. Second-hand smoke is dangerous when a person is constantly exposed to it, but just one exposure can be dangerous to people with pre-existing conditions. As of 2010, legislation across the United States has banned smoking in restaurants to protect restaurant workers and non-smoking patrons. Long-term exposure to cigarette smoke leads to long-term ill health effects. Those who inhale second-hand smoke on a regular basis have the same risks as smokers. These include cancer, heart disease and emphysema. Restaurant workers in businesses that allow smoking showed detectable levels of NNK. NNK is a carcinogen in cigarettes that has been directly linked to the development of lung cancer. In 2004, the University of California conducted a study, which found the banning of smoking reduced heart attacks by as much as one-fifth. Finland also has a ban on smoking in restaurants and a study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health found the number of sick days in the workplace was reduced by thousands. A proposed ban on smoking in restaurants, bars and cafÃ©s has spurred a debate about how the economic consequences will weigh out, as those against the ban caution that bars and restaurants, as well as state revenue, will suffer if fewer people buy cigarettes, while supporters of the ban say the overall improved health of citizens will make up for any losses. Banning smoking in restaurants has thus proven an excellent measure for keeping clean various pipes in musical instruments as well as in humans",B1.2
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it is not only to give money but it is one of the social studies, I think. Almost of college students can get money that they need to live from their parents. So I think that we don't need to have a part time job for getting money. I don't have a part time job now. But I can live enough now. And, college students have to study. But to have a part time job is not only for to get money. It is good social studies. It makes me thinking to get money is what and work in the social is what. And, we can learn social rule, way of talk, and more. For my example, I had a part time job in YAKINIKU restaurant. My work in the restaurant is service customer. I learn how to talk to customer and rule of meal a little. And the restaurant has many foreign customers, so I can learn English in restaurant well. Part time job have many what to learn and is very good social study. So I think college student have to have a part time job.",A2
"I don't agree this statement. Of course student have a part-time job is a good phenomenon. But that is not everything. Outside activity is waiting. Going to the mountain, sea, palace is good activity for student. But nowadays, part-time job is required student. Registration fee is so high; student is finally seeking a part-time job. But don't mind registration fee, do not important part-time job. Many people think that part-time job is good experience and earn money. I agree this statement. But the world is many experience activity. For example, habitat and volunteer, travel etc. Part-time job is not entire to campus life. Student has to broaden think. Some student is regret to campus life. That's why concentrate on study. Afterward, he saw the past life, don't remain thing. So, campus life is finally return to me. Twenty is most important time anyone. Time is not return. I want to go to abroad and meet a friend. And understand different culture. Additionally, reading a book is enjoying another travel.

"I think it is a good regulation that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, there are pros and cons for smoking. However, there is only one advantage comes into my mind. People who smoke will trigger chemical reaction in their brain which makes them feel good, happy, and comfortable, but they will have to get more cigarettes to achieve the same level of happiness. Thus, the first disadvantage is that people will gradually spend more money on smoking. Second, the most serious problem resulted from smoking is health damage. Smoking destroys people's lungs. Smokers can't breathe as well as normal ones. They can't be good athletes. Health issues may influence their life qualities, too. Besides, smoking increase the risk of suffering from cancer. What's worse, smoking has great impact on both smokers and people around those smokers. That's the main reason I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. When someone smokes in a restaurant, it does not only influence others at that time but also people who come in the future. Because those furniture and walls may absorb the bad things come from the cigarettes, and then impact future customers. Thus, I think smoking ought to be prohibited at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.2
"Smoking is the most popular bad habit of people nowadays. Advertisements about smoking which says that smoking is very dangerous to your health is everywhere and we can see them everyday but still people especially teenagers continue to smoke. Others say that smoking is cool; it is their way of relieving stress, and mostly influenced by others. Sometimes when friends want to talk to each other they stay in a place where they can eat, drink, talk at the same time, surf the net and smoke. This is why smoking in restaurants must be banned, because others who want to eat only and spend the time with their friends or family or considered the secondhand smokers breathe the same air that the smokers breathe. So once the smokers smoke the smoke that comes from the cigarette combines with the air we breathe so when other people breathe they can be classified as smokers too or worse cause smokers smoke with filters secondhand smokers inhale the smoke without filter. That's why smoking in restaurants must be banned cause instead of destroying the smoker's health only it destroys everyone's health in the restaurant. Smoking must ne banned not only in restaurants but also in public places where most of the people in a certain place stay, walk, meet etc.",B1.2

Moreover they can share the burden self-made teach them positive thinking and they learn from this fair use of money which they get from their parents at the time of necessity. But according to my point of view a balanced students is always successful in this regard. He should equally pay his attention to his studies. One thing, which is important that is part time job should be according to his taste in which, he can't feel any burden. Part time job must not be imposed on the student when he is not in the mood.

We can undoubtedly improve our ability to get along with different people such as nosy consumers and strict managers, which contributes to our future working life. 2. We are bound to learn some useful skills from practice to a certain degree. Moreover, the experience of doing a part time job may help you to find a job after your graduation. 3. The incomes can be used freely. We needn't told our parents what we have bought because the money is our own reward. It really gives us a sense of being independent.

Smoking is also haram in Islam because many other bad things start from it and it's the rule of Islam that nips the evil in the bud. so Islam do not give permission for it further more the things which cause harm for humans beings Islam do not permit those things and smoking is one of them. a person who is habitude of smoking mostly have very unbearable smell in his mouth while he talks other people feel bad and avoid to take him again. So gradually he lost his good friends and become alone. this thing made him feel up from life and he lost interest in his dressing food and family and sometime comments suicide smoking always harmful for human beings in any foam it dial not give any benefit to anyone except the owner of tobacco companies so the benefit of a nation more important than a single person so the Govt. of employer should completely banned tobacco companies if any Govt. do so then I think it was blessing of Allah on that country.,B1.2
"I agree that college students have part time jobs. Do we only study in college? No, I don't think that. Of course if you work in part time jobs too hard and don't study in college, it is too bad but part time job in itself is not bad thing, because I will show you why it is. First, you can experience many things that you can't experience in college. For example you can teach math, English and science for high school or junior high school students. In part time job, you can discover your new sides. Second, we can enter new community. For example senior manager will tell you how to communicate customers, also you must tell youngers it too. Finally you will utilize its experiences for your own work in the future. Of course what you have learned in college is the most important to enter a company which you want to enter. But after entering, you may utilize what you have learned in part time job. If you don't have its experiences, you can't cope with many kinds of works or problems, for example how to communicate olds or youngers or solve some accidents which you don't think happens, however if you have it, you can act quickly and flexibly. Part time jobs have these good sides so college students work, if they don't forget to study.",A2
"I think we shouldn't make it a rule to prohibit smoking in a restaurant. Everyone has right to do what he or she wants as far as they don't harm other people. Many says the smoke from the cigarette harm other people. I think so too, but is that only the smoke? We use a car and it makes terrible noise or exhaust gas. Those harm other people too, however we don't have the idea that we should prohibit driving a car. What is the difference between these cases? I think we can't take them right to do what they want easily whatever they do. In deed I really hate smoking. The smoke makes my clothes smell and it feels me sick. For people like me, I think there should be some rules to avoid the smoke. Nowadays many restaurants separate the area the one is for non-smoker and the other is for smoker. This is very good idea. I think there are many opinions to this problem and there are many ideas to solve this problem. However only I can say is that we shouldn't make rules easily. So I disagree that smoking should be burned at all restaurants in Japan.",B1.2
"I agree this statement. Because part-time job give us precious experience. And, we need money to live. For example, I work in JUKU. I experience precious time. Education is reception for me before. But, education means giving for me now. Education is very difficult. I realize this now. First, I worry that I work in JUKU. Now, I don't regret that. Making money is also important point for us. I was given money by parents before. So, making money is also giving me a few proud. Sure, I am not independent and can't live without parents. Junior high school student is difficult for me. I usually can't realize what they think. But, they give me energy. Maybe, some people think that part-time job prevented students from studying. It is right idea, sure. Some people can't concentrate in their study. But, other people can work in part-time job and can study hard. Maybe, it is minority. But we should not ignore them. Both studying hard and working hard in part-time job is difficult for young people. Little by little, we will be used to being this. If we used to being this once, we may are strong as adult than before. So, part-time job is important for us.",B2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for many reasons. First, smoking affects others who are in the restaurant seriously. No matter how terrible influence the smoker does to his body, the second-hand smoke causes others indeed, which is the second reason. Third, the mod which smokers produce will pollute the clear air of public area. Many people who don't smoke always think why the smokers cannot adopt our advices to get rid of smoking. It is said that smokers cannot control their desire to get away from cigarette. Smokers smoke for many reasons. For example, after smoking they will feel released when they are under the pressure. Some teenagers think that it is cool to pick a cigarette across the finger. However, while smoking, they don't conscious that long-term smoking will damage to their lung. Moreover, it will get long cancer easily. Not only the smokers, but also the second-hand smokers. Therefore, I think that if the smokers insist not to protect their body, they should protect other people at least. So I definitely agree that smoking should be completely banned not only at all the restaurants, but in every public area in the country.",B1.1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is not only the slogan or the post in front of the restaurant but also the rule that everybody should be follow. And what are not smoking should be banned at all the restaurants? There are two reasons that can explain why can not smoking at the restaurants. The first one is benefit everybody's health. The smoking is totally not hurt for the person who smokes the cigarette and the smoke is more hurt the other who didn't smoke. I thought it is not very faith for the people who didn't smoke and the smoke is hurt their health. And the restaurant is the public space so it should be banned that people can not smoke at the restaurants. The second reason is for the smell in the restaurant. The restaurant is the place that everyone enjoys their food and it must full of the good smell of food. If some smoke at the restaurant it should be make the air not clean and the smell is not very good for the person to enjoy their dish. So I think smoke at the restaurant is very impolite for other people. Finally, I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This way is not only for the smoker's but also protect other person health.",B1.1
"But because there are many hidden benefits to having a part-time job, I think that many students stand to benefit by having one. For example, I work at the rec center, and as a result I spend a lot of time thinking about health and fitness and how to become stronger, faster, and more fit. Most of my coworkers are the same way, and most of us have a very high level of fitness. This is the hidden benefit that I was talking about. Not only do we have a good job at a fun place on campus, we can learn about how to be healthy and we can have a place where we can do all the things we need to do to stay fit. In the same way, there are different in benefits to different part-time jobs. For example, if you work at a pizza restaurant, you can learn how to make pizza and you can also eat as much as you want to, although that might be bad for you. Every part time job has a hidden benefit that you can take advantage of if you only take the small effort to think about all the things you are doing and how you can work on those things to benefit yourself as well.",C2
"Part time jobs are jobs that require fewer hours per week by a person as compared to a full time job. There are many reasons to take up a part time job, but the primary reason is due to lack of money. Some people, such as students or senior citizens, aim for part time jobs for their primary source of earning; others use this means as a secondary source of income, often when their first job pay is not enough for their sustenance or contemptment. Some of the typical part time jobs include working in a restaurant, a retail store, a call center, a public library, a university, or a factory. The largest group of part time job workers are students, most aged between seventeen and twenty-three. This may be to pay for educational expenses or simply to earn more pocket money. Again, part time jobs may vary reasons and causes. Other individuals take up part time jobs because doing that particular kind of work is where their true passion may lay, but think that this particular activity cannot support their means of living. It also does not include many benefits as compared to a full time job. There are usually no health insurances, stock options, or even financial incentives.",B1.2
"The smoking ban in pubs establishment care very pleased to make public. Also in the announcement. It has added more non-smoking places other four types: 1.

"A college student may or may not get a part time job, but it is quiet important to have one. Some of student who live with his or her parents tend to not get a part time job, because he or she may get whatever they when they live with their parents. Students, who do not live with their parents, many of them get a part time job, to get more money to satisfy their needs. Having a part time job is to make student get ready to have a real job after their college, besides students who get a part time job tend to be independent compare to the one who does not have. Students who get a part time job, usually proud of themselves, they can produce their own money by working and they can buy their needs by their own money. In Indonesia, there are not many shops or store that provided a part time job for students, which is the reason most of Indonesian students are depend with their parents, not like in other country. Students should try to get part time job and independent, because years by years jobs are getting tougher and tougher and that is why students should try to have a part time job to make themselves ready for their real work.",B1.2
"Smoking is a bad habit which causes negative impacts to our health, but the numbers of people who smoke stay high, leading to a debatable topic on whether or not smoking should be banned in all restaurant. Before giving my standpoint, I would like to define the term'restaurant'. For me, restaurant refers to an indoor place which provides meals. Thus restaurant doesn't mean bar or cafÃ© which only serve snacks and drink. As there are less people from all walks of life, and I don't see a big impact in these places. On the other hand, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants, as there are many different kinds of people having meals there. They may be children, students, pregnant women, and many other non-smokers. Smoking causes second-hand smoke which surely harms the other's health. It would be unfair to those who don't smoke, as they are forced to smoke. No one has the right to harm the others. Thus the smoker should not have to smoke around the non-smokers. Some people may say they also have the right to smoke, but I think this stands only when they are not affecting the others. I think the law is powerful enough to prevent the second-hand smoke from harming the non-smokers' health. Hope that by restricting the smoking venues, the number of smokers will decrease and more and more people will get rid of this bad habit.",B1.1
"Everyone knows that smoking is a bad habit, it can cause many bad things. In some country smoking in public area is banned to reduce the effect. In Indonesia there is some reason that make hard to banned. In Indonesia smoking is more than just a habit, but it is something that everyone must do it. There is a lot of children that smoking, they do not know that is a bad habit that can cause cancer, etc. Some people know about it but they still smoking. The government try to reduce it with make a rule that not allowed to smoking in public area in the exchange the government make some place to smoke, but there is still so many people smoke in public area. In other side most of Indonesia people is working for cigarette company, if smoker is reduce the company must reduce the employee. That make more job for the government to do. In the fact cigarette can cause many bad thing. Cigarette can make other people around the smoker get the same bad thing. So government must make the rule more restrict that make smoker stop they bad habit, and the exchange for the employee of cigarette company is a new job.",B1.2
"Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. Aside from the leading cause of death, it is also a source of a very foul and unpleasant smell. Today, even at schools, people are smoking and it is really disgusting. Some students think that smoking is cool but in reality, smoking isn't cool and in fact, it is very uncool and very disturbing. Our government should initiate the campaign to ban smoking at all restaurants, because aside from its very unpleasant smell, it is also very dangerous to our health. It is also a sign of negligence and disrespect to your neighbors, as not all people around you are smokers and thus some of them might be disturb and feel sick due to the smell. For me, smoking shouldn't only be banned at restaurants in the country but also, all the establishments as well. If you want to smoke then smoke at your own place, but not on a public establishment as it may affect other people around you. People know that smoking is bad to their health but why do they still do it? Some say that it gives a great relief to their problems while others started smoking due to their curiosity. But this has to be changed, smoking shouldn't be consider as an option to stress because it will not solve problems but rather add a lot of them such as lung sickness and other health hazards. In conclusion, by banning smoking at restaurants and establishment smokers will have less chance to smoke and kill themselves at the public. If this rule will be properly implemented, our government will not just save the health of the non-smokers but also, the lives of the smokers.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement. Because smoking is the murder as well as the suicide. When one smokes, people around him have greater possibility for cancer and other diseases. Who says it is not the murder? Of course those who do the murder at the restaurants are to be banned. And the penalty for it is very strict. Why smoking is excluded from the murder? In addition to this, smoking is the suicide. The suicide is the murder for oneself. It must be strange to tell the suicide from the murder. These are the same as ""right"" war. In the world, right war is impossible because it is nothing but violence. The violence can't be right. And smoking can't be right, too. That is, the war is direct violence, on the other hand, smoking is'indirect'violence. But according to the custom, these are acceptable. The murder and the suicide at the restaurants could exist. It must be strange. In addition to this, Japan is democratic country. Democracy can't go with the violence. And Japan can't have any weapons which hurt oneself or others. It is clear that tobacco is a weapon. So we should ban completely smoking at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"When it comes to smoking banning, quite a lot of people will support this policy because smoking is not about a problem of personal habits but a public concern. Though enjoyable as smoking is for smokers, the behavior of smoking is unpleasing in public. It will discomfort people near you. Everyone should be considerate about others. It is reported that the annual number of people killed by smoking is increasing. And now not only man but also women smoke a lot. This trend will have an bad impact on the health of our future generation. Moreover, smoking in public is more dangerous. Second hand smoke is really bad for other people whose rate of lung disease will be higher than smokes themselves. It is un moral and these smokers can't take the responsibility. So, from the health point of view, smoking is absolutely harmful to human and therefore must be banned especially in public places such as restaurants. Environmentally, smoking cause pollution. The situation of air is getting more and more worse. Both people and nature will be suffering. We should publish a standard of monitoring environmental equality in large cities to avoid more air pollution. It is time we tighten great control over smoking banning in public places and strictly deal with the polluted environment and treat the pollution.",B1.2
"Why should smoking be banned in all restaurants in the country? What are the benefits of smoke-free restaurants? Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because restaurants are for eating, not smoking. People in the restaurant will inhale the fumes or smoke that can affect the health of those people who do not smoke thus having the risks of acquiring diseases like the ones who really smoke. People should enjoy eating in restaurants and not worry about their health. Smoking in crowded places is harmful not only to the person who smokes but also to the people around them. They inhale the nicotine in the air that can cause severe diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, etc. Smoke-free restaurant will be a delightful experience to non-smokers. They can enjoy their food with a pleasant ambiance with no worrying about their health. It will also lessen the risks of acquiring diseases that are related to smoking. Banning smoking in restaurants can also protect children, pregnant women, old people, employees and customers from the second-hand smokes that can be harmful to them when inhaled. Also, being a smoke-free restaurant can entice the customer to return because of the healthier environment that the restaurant provide.",B1.2
"We know that smoking is always banned in all of the place actually. Why? Because it has many bad risks for all of the aspects of our life, even though in the restaurant area in this country. And i think it is done properly. I agree with this statement to ban smoking in the restaurant area. Restaurant is one of public facilities which there are so many people who not at all of them is include to smoker. Many people take their child because restaurant is the place which so convert to getter together. So direct or indirect it can influence of comfortability to visitors. We know there are so many effect if we are include to smoker, bad effect surely. First, the most effect is disturbing the breathing, disturbing the lung, and the most scream is cancer of lung, and so on. So this is one of reason, why the smoking is not allowed in restaurant. But i think, this is not only for restaurant as public facility, but also in other public facility, may be at the market, mosque, church, bus stop, railway station another public facility. Some of the solutions is the owner of restaurant provide a special place for smoker, where at that place only for they who have a smoke. But at sometime, this rule is not followed by some people, they feel lazy to go to the box smoke. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoke and hard punishment for everyone who disobey the rule.",A2
"Part-time jobs now a days are very common to students who needs financial help, most of the part-time working students are in the college level because college is very expensive and sometimes students cannot reach the academic standards of the college/university scholarship so they either have to stop college or work part-time for their tuition fees and academic expenses. but for those who are scholars who are studying but still need academic expenses work part-time in some fast foodchains with minimum wage. In some colleges/universities offers financial help for those who are in need its either they get a sponsor or they work on campus such as a library assistant and they're given a minimum wage and it shows that they are often more responsible because they support their our expenses daily and academically. A student working part-time has lots of work loads and responsibilities like working for their food for the next day and at the same time make a midterm plate for their majors subjects and study for the written midterm examination of their minor subjects and they earn their own money for their school expenses. And there for if you not that responsible and you have a part-time job its better to earn money for future academic expenses and it will help you learn to be more responsible.",B1.2
"In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for many reasons. First; it might have a bad effect on everyone in the restaurants. No matter what you smokes or you don't smoke, you are affected by unfresh air flowing around you. It means you body is in danger. If you are on the restaurant which fulls of smoking because the smoking is cause to many disease for example cancer or the disease which relate to a lung ect. Moreover, children can't come to the restaurant which allow to smoking. Restaurant should be the place where every member enjoy and be happy but it is not if the owner or manager of the restaurant allows smoking. Finally, it may support teenagers smoking. Because smoking is not banned at all restaurant. Teenagers or children see a bad thing. The result is they met smoke in one day. In the failure, it maybe reduces the average human's life time because smoking causes people having a weak body and respiratory disease. It is clear that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I do really agree and support the statement. I really hope that it could be real and everyone can make it happens.",B1.1
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion, I agree with the part-time job is important for college students because I think it was necessary with college students. A part-time job is good things for help students have a good experience. It will teach you that you should to do. The part-time job will help you have saving. And then you have money so you can help your parents. Now, the part-time job is population and most of interesting for people who want to earn money. It makes you usefully time. It will make you have honest and have ability. And the part-time job will get the good experience for college students. Then it will make you to be a good work. And you can use your experience when you work your part-time job for daily life. You can practice you every skill before work in future. I think that the part-time job is very important for everybody. It is a good education outside the classroom. It can teach you every thing that you want to know. When you do part-time job you will be fell good because you will very proud of yourself. When you can earn money themselves. And you can make your parents proud of you.",A2
"I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Going through college, or university, is a time of learning and the student should be whole-heartedly focused on the acquisition of knowledge and of gaining relevant skills for the working world. However, this does not have to be achieved through students taking up part-time jobs outside of curriculum time in university. Universities offer students many opportunities such as internships, courses and workshops, directly and indirectly, for them to have a glimpse of the working world and to gain skills about how best to carry themselves in the working world. Hence, a part-time job would not be as important in this context as the students would not require a part-time job to gain experience about the working world. Some may argue that a part-time job is important for students to earn some pocket money during their university or college years so they will be less of a burden to their parents who have to help pay for their education. I believe that this is true, and that college students should try their best to help lessen the burden on their parents. However, there are ways that this can be done without compromising the student's education on a part-time job. For example, the student can earn a decent amount of money during internships. This can help to pay for their daily expenses, lessening their parents' burden, and students will also learn a great deal during the internships, more than when they are just taking up a job, as internships require students to work closely with the employers, and also allows them to create networks that would serve important in future.

"Literate people can read and write but normal people cannot read and write two different things at the same time. There is such thing called multi-tasking, though. It is the ability to do two or more things at the same time. Everyone has done that but to be able to do one's best, one has to focus on doing one thing at a time. For instance, when singing and dancing, one must learn to either sing the song or dance to the beat first before being able to do the same at the same time really well. If not, it may take time before the performer masters his or her job. This is because the person will be confused if he or she hasn't mastered at least one of the routine prior to the joint performance. This concept is same with the concept of working students. They will not be able to do their best in the academic aspect since their time and attention is divided. Studying alone is a lot different and has more advantages as opposed studying while working. As of now, a lot of students prefer to work while studying. We cannot blame them for choosing to do so because they have a reason for that: lack of money. On the bright side, it may still be added to their credentials and this will be an advantage as they apply for a job. Personally, I have high respect for students who work for part time jobs. What they're doing requires a lot of patience, hard work and sacrifice. The experience they have earns them the values they gain and honor they deserve.",B1.2
"Smoking is a bad habit. It is a form of drug like heroin etc. but it is not a pure form of drugs. First people take it as an enjoyment with friends but later it becomes habit. The addiction of smoking becomes a part of them. The smoke which emit from cigarette is very dangerous for health. The person which is use to of smoking is affected directly because he takes smoke in but the people living with him are also affected and indirectly. The smoke which he emits from his mouth and from cigarette is very dangerous for other people also. There are some abnormalities in the children of those smokers which are not much observed in younger age but can be observed when they grew older. When the smokers go to any restaurant and start smoking the other people who are not use to of this smell feel disturbance. Some people who are allergic to its smell. The smell becomes a part of edibles. Some people feel nausea to its smell. So, the smoking should be banned in restaurants. The advertisement should be banned. The cigarettes should be banned in shops. The young nation is spoiled by bad habit of smoking. It's after affect are miserable. There are many institutions who are working for it.

"What are part time jobs? What is its significance in a society? Is it permanent? Is it helpful to the society? I 'm going to answer these questions that bother me about part time job. In my own idea based on what I learned, part time jobs are jobs which are not permanent but part time only, meaning people who do part time jobs will only work for duration of time and after that they will need to renew their contract or find a new part time job. Carpentry is an example of a part time job where in carpenters can only work up to the contract is finished. The significance of part time jobs is very important especially for those people who can't find a permanent job. Part time jobs are very helpful in a society composed of many skilled workers but lacking in different jobs or occupations. It can be useful for students who lack of money for their tuition because their parents can't sustain their studying needs. It can help for working students because they can earn money from it and continue to study in their desired profession or discipline. Even though it is not permanent, it has a big impact on our society today to have educated people. Even being a working student is hard I think it is worth it especially for those who really need to continue their studies.",B1.2
"Smoking is a bad habit, but it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many people may question and doubt why, but the reason is obvious. Of course smoking is harmful for health, and it would also affect others' health, however, if we advocate no smoking in all the restaurants in country, does anybody think of the chain-smokers? Chain smokers have made it a rule to smoke, it's so hard to ask them quit smoking habit in short time. So, if all the restaurants ban the smoking, it may result in a wave of anger. Besides, the measure seems so extreme that many smokers may choose not to eat out. What will happen at last? Some restaurants are likely to break the rules to attract customers and make money. In my opinion, restaurants should set up a smoking place or smoking rooms instead of banning smoking, the action doesn't encourage people to smoke, it just offer some room for smokers to relax temporally. A chain-smoker will be unhappy without smoking, and who wants to see somebody having a long face when enjoying meal at restaurants? In conclusion, setting up smoking places is better than banning smoking at all restaurants, the former may be a better policy and be reciprocal for all the restaurants, costumers and smokers.",B1.2
"Smoking is an absolutely disgusting habit, and I have no sympathy for the people who choose to destroy their bodies by smoking cigarettes. The fact that smoking is allowed at restaurants in Japan is simply astonishing given the otherwise forward thinking and technological advancement in that country. In a Japanese history class, I learned that Japan is usually quick to import the customs of other countries and adapt them into their own unique Japanese way. Many states in the United States of America have already banned smoking in public places including restaurants, and this would lead me to believe that Japan will eventually do so as well. It is simply a matter of time until enough people realize that it is simply not acceptable to have a habit that can directly affect the health of other people around you especially people you don't even know. It would seem that any sensible person would not want to give a complete stranger any kind of health problems especially ones as serious as the ones that accompany smoking and second hand smoke. If the Japanese follow the pattern of their own history which has already been established I think that it is only a matter of time before they follow the example set by the United States and ban smoking in all the public restaurants.",C2
"I argue that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. This is in the context of a student who has sufficient financial resources for his studies. First, a student who works while studying may suffer poorer grades, due to less study time. Second, he would have lesser time to engage in extra-curricular activities, which are vital for his future job prospects. Employers often look at such activities when deciding hiring decisions. Hence, he may lose out on a high paying job just because his time was spent on working in lowly paid part time work. Some may argue that work experience is important for students. I would counter by saying that work experience can be gotten during summer holidays, in internship programs. These can be pursued on a full-time basis, particularly in the industry of choice. In contrast, part time work usually involves low skilled tasks on an ad-hoc basis. There is little momentum and learning involved, that can be applicable to future use. Third, family time may be sacrificed by working on a part time job. Human beings are social creatures. We crave emotional ties and familial bonds. Thus, time spent on family bonding and interaction would present significantly higher utility than part time work. In sum, I argue it is not important for college students to have a part time job.

"Smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants across the country. There is not a single benefit from the habit that justifies the continuation of an act which endangers not just the smoker's health but also the people physically in close proximity. Smoking has been a social habit since the 18th century, and has undergone several evolutions before being marketed globally and becoming a lucrative business. Smoking is the number one cause for the high rates of lung cancers and other smoke related diseases. Nothing strange about that, if one looks closely at the components of a cigarette. Nicotine, tartar and other harmful chemicals are all packed into this little package which promises a momentary physical ""paradise"" for its users, and require frequent use if users want to relive this comfortable state. Most people are addicted to it not purely by choice, but by a physical addiction, which is triggered by psychological responses to the withdrawal symptoms if one attempts to quit smoking. People around smokers get what we call ""second hand smoke"", which researchers say are at least as dangerous as the ""first hand smoke"" smokers get. Thus, we can see the extended damage that smoking can cause. Smoking is a common tool of social bonding between smokers, which is not to be neglected since smokers form a considerable part of society. Given its large industry, tobacco and cigarette manufacturers are formidable establishments which can be detrimental to economies if they are to be closed down. These are the significant reasons why smoking still exists. We have seen why smoking still persists, even if obvious reasons justify their elimination. Still, advocates against smoking are commonly supported, and smoking is continually being eradicated across the world. Other than restaurants, other places are starting to ban smoking entirely, and this is a good first move towards a cleaner world for all. ",B1.2
A smoking is defined as acigarate which we inhale for our satisfaction and mind relaxation is formed from the leaves of tobacco. People smoke for their mind satisfaction when they are in tension or feel looseness. Smoking also has side effects. It can damage our lungs and can be the cause of cancer. Today through smoking can cause lips cancer. People do that when they are alone need mind satisfaction. Once they get addict it is a very through from them to through that addiction away. Some people smoke only for joy or seeing someone who is smoking and get impressed from them and starts that. And they become addict of that. Our media play an important role by smoking the bad effects or horrible effects of smoking and people were becoming aware for its side effects. And its harmful effects on health. But some people do not take it serious and face harmful effects in the near future. but as the time is passing on the smoking is becoming a part of our life especially young generation now a days feel proud to say that they are smoker. Smoke helps you to lie down quickly in graves.,B1.2
" Nowadays, college is not only a place for us to study, but also a place where we can learn how to communicate with others and prepare to work in future. So, in my opinion, it's important to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows: First, it's a good way to relieve some students' financial pressure. For some students, their family can't afford to pay the tuition every year, and it will be a pity if they drop halfway. Faced with this problem, some of them turn to their teacher for help and get some money from the school. However, the money is usually not able to cover all of their expense, as a consequence of which, they try to get money by doing a part-time job. For example, a senior used to open a small store in Taobao and find a part-time job near the school at the same time. Therefore, he can pay the tuition by himself and afford his family some money. So doing a part-time job is able to help relieve students' burden coming from financial problem. Second, doing a part-time job is a great chance for us students to improve ourselves. My part-time job is to work in the piano room, which makes me meet plenty of new friends and know how to work with other fellows. Cooperating with people I'm not familiar with is truly a challenge, and I gradually realize that the skill of communication is really important. What's more, doing part-time job makes me understand how important it is to get along with friends as well as strangers, and that making money isn't easy at all. So, you can guess how happy I was when I was paid for the first time! To conclude, a part-time job is surely of great significance, though some of them may take much time and energy. Just manage your time and try doing a part-time job, and you may benefit a lot from it!",B1.2
"I do not think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. We are very young, and we have a lot to worry about, so we don't need to waste any time on things that we don't absolutely have to do. For example, when major is engineering, and every week I have hours and hours of classes and homework and lab assignments. Even if I wanted to work, I would be hard pressed to find the time, and I also think that I would be very stressed out by adding anything more to my already busy schedule. I know a lot of people would disagree with me on this, but I kind of think it is parent's responsibility to provide for their children at least through college. Certainly, after they graduate student should get a fulltime job in begin their careers in earnest, but for the time being I think we should enjoy the little time we have before we're forced to become real adults and spend all our time being serious. In addition, I don't understand why everyone expects us to be so responsible even though we're just kids, so I think it is not really necessary for college students to be working.",C2
"It goes without saying that smoking do has bad influences on our bodies. If we keep smoking for a long period, we may be addicted to it as a result of the substance in the smoke named nicotine. It is possible that we are too addicted to quit smoking as we realize that smoking is such a terrible thing, unless we have the great determination and willpower to overcome all the difficulties we may meet during the time of quitting smoking. Besides this, smoking will weaken our lungs and increase the probability of suffering from lung cancer. Provided that we suffer from lung cancer, it will make not only ourselves uncomfortable but our family unhappy and worried about us as well, and the worst one is that we may even die because of it. Moreover, when smoking, we produce a kind of material which is so-called ""second-hand smoke"". Second-hand smoke will affect people around the smokers, making their health become bad. They may also get the same disease and consequences as smokers. To sum up, cigarette smoking is really bad for our health. As a consequence, we should never smoke no matter what kind of conditions we are in. In addition, we are supposed to persuade our family accustomed to smoking to stop doing it.",B1.1
"Take a part time job while we are studying is a good idea and worth to try. First of all, we can earn some money for sure. With that money, we can buy something we like to buy, especially when our parents doesn't want to give the money because their think it is not really important. In other way, we also can keep that money and start learn to give 10% from that money to God, as what He word tells us to do. Secondly, by taking a part time job we will get some skills which are good for us now and then. Actually, we will not have many times when we take a job while we studying, but with the situation like that we will be push to be independent in manage our time and make our life more effective. The experience that we get from the job will be very useful for us someday when we enter the real job world. And the last, we will have more friends beside our friends in school or college. It is very good if us can learn something from the people in our work place like as how to be success. If we want to be success, we have to learn from those people who already be success before us. So, with so many advantages like that, I think have a part time job while studying is a good idea.",A2
"I don't agree because firstly, there are way too many smokers' opinions in Japan for the Japanese Government to just override and secondly, it really should be up to each restaurant and each person to decide for themselves without Government interference. If I owned a restaurant and I was complying with the standard food and beverage laws, why should the government Japanese or otherwise, come in and tell me how to run my business. What would be next on the agenda, banning karaoke or non-bottled water, only allowing customers in who are wearing pink shoes? A restaurant is usually a private concern and should be left that way if they meet the standard health regulations related to food and drink that I mentioned. The moment that governments start to over-regulate is usually when the problem/s get worse. Apart from kids, adults should be allowed to make their own choices about where they want to eat and the restaurants have the right to allow or disallow smoking on their own premises. That's just a part of fair trade in my view and consumers have the right to let their wallets do their talking by not going to smoking or non-smoking venues/restaurants as they see fit.",C2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job may help students to choose job in the future. And we can meet new colleague, such as college student, elderly people, and high school student. We can experience some kind of part-time jobs, and learn the difficulty of getting money. In fact I'm working at restaurant near Rokkomichi. I have worked there for half a year. It is a first time for me to work. I can know how to service and its difficulty. Sometimes it is hard for me but I enjoy working and servicing. I think it is very important for me to have part-time job. I want to encourage college students who don't have part-time job to have it. But we must make much of study, and a part-time job must not prevent us from studying. We should have a part-time job as far as we can. Since I have had my part-time job, I have come to live actively. A part-time job can not only give us money but also give us motivation for our daily life. Having a part-time job is a very valuable experience in college life. So I agree that college students have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I agree with the above statement for a number of reasons. The most important reason however, is that I believe that anyone who goes to work, even part time, will better learn the value and responsibility of money and how hard people have to work to get it. By working a part time job, students will better understand and appreciate what a good education costs these days. Many students I knew in University didn't pay a dime of their University tuitions and only worked during their summer vacations. I myself had to work full time in the summers and part time through the rest of the school year in order to save enough for my tuition and daily living expenses. Furthermore, that experience of having to balance my studies, work schedule, finances and social life all at the same time, has benefit me every day since. I strongly believe that it allowed to do better in the job I got after graduating as I'd already experienced a lot of the requirements of actually having a job while still a student. Some of my co-workers who had not did not do so well A part time job, a full time job or any job for that matter can only be seen as a positive life experience for any young college student.",C2
"I agree with to do part-time job. Certainly, studying is the most important thing for students. But I think that it is important to do part-time job. There are many reasons to think that. First, we university students need money to spend full campus life. For example, we enjoy circle or club activity, study abroad, and buy textbooks with spending much money. Second, part-time job teach us a lot of rule of society. To earn money is difficult. So, it makes our spirit strong. Because of this, we must be responsible for our job when we do it. If we have a trouble in our job, we must not escape from there and we should make efforts to solve it. And part-time job teach us correct way of talking. So I think that part-time job is the best practice for a full-time job. Third, we university students must independent from our parents gradually. When we were high school students, we are totally dependent on our parents for food, clothing, and shelter. But some university students live alone. Then, they can't eat foods cooked by their mothers. Earning money to do part-time job is one of way to independent from their parents. So I think that it is important to do part-time job for university students.",B1.1
"A part-time job is important for student. I think the students should do it. Because it is help to student find money. Especially student in the family poor or the parents cannot pay. Because their parents have already cost much. They are help parents to save money by working part- time. Find money for buy book, pencils, pen, papers and other materials for study. In study working part-time is very difficult for student. It must control for good. Otherwise study is very bad. Demand of all student has very much. Because today competition are a lot. Whether it is a matter of personal values that are high in fashion, special Education. It is not enough for expenses. Because of this, it is yonder I have difficulties in daily life. When they are busy working part time that dose not interfere with school hours and activities at work. To find work, it must refer to the remuneration that pleased silk. Finding a part-time job is not easy. If we do not have time to go to work. And do not have money instead of baked. Today is also a part-time work among student to be extremely. Has to part-time job many forms. Depending on which one to choose jobs.",A2
"College students need lots of money because they have to pay tuition fee. Also they need fee of transportation and they have to buy lunch. All these expenses are very big deal to students. Registration of school is very expensive. Many students receive money from their parents but it is limited. Therefore, having a part-time job is required by students. Students can help their parents' worry by doing a part-time job. Even students are busy for school works, they can feel satisfaction. In my case, my parents give me money once a month. I have no part-time jobs. I have to spend money for reasonable price every time. Sometimes, I want to buy a brand-new clothe or an expensive bag. But my pocket has limit so I can't buy something that written on my wish list. If I have a part-time job, I can buy clothes or a bag. However, having a part-time job makes me tired and very busy so I don't want to have a part-time job. Gathering money is easier to me than earning money. On the other hands, in summer vacation or winter vacation, that is exception. In my free time like vacation, I find a part-time job because just I'm free!",B1.1
"I agree that is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, I'm a fresh man in society, and I want to find a job recently. When I mail my work plan or my work experience to employer, but always no answer. I try to find a explain, it's maybe cause my work experience less than other people. Second, part-time job can train personal time management for college students, a lot of college students used to be a super man, it means college students use a half of 24 hour to sleep, play computer, night active, and so on. But they can't spend time to rest, study, or doing something good! Third, part-time job can earn more cash. College students have more and more opportunity to join a lot of party or buy something I like; it needs money to do this. More and more family can't offer much more money to their child now, that perhaps think how to solve this question, and part-time job maybe can be useful!! So I think part-time job can train college students have more work experience, or be independent. So I agree a college student to have a part-time job is important.",A2
"Smoking ban in public restaurants should be implemented for the betterment of our environment as well as the people living in it. As we all know, smoking is not beneficial in any sense. Smokers may acquire lung and heart diseases that, of course, will cause harm to their health. And also, second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure causes lung cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in innocent non-smoking adults and children. Banning smoking will eradicate the major cause of respiratory diseases. Smoking also contributes to the air pollution in public places that makes our environment unclean. Banning smoking will contribute to the improvement of our environment's cleanliness in the sense that it will lessen air pollution caused by smoking. Smoking, nowadays, is considered as a major vice, wherein majority of the users are teenagers. It is obvious that they are still not in the right age to engage in this kind of activity and parents are highly not in favor with it. Banning smoking will help lessen the increasing number of smokers, particularly the teenagers. A ban would discourage smokers to smoke. If smoking will be banned in public places, particularly in restaurants, it will no longer be a social activity. If smoking will be a less social activity, fewer people will start smoking.",B1.2
"Non-smokers generally find it offensive when they enter restaurants to find that people sitting at the next table are smoking. This is because the smell of the smoke usually annoys them, and they cannot truly enjoy the food. I am also a non-smoker, and I find this situation to be very offensive, but I do not think that smoking should be banned completely at restaurants throughout Japan. Even though we non-smokers find it annoying that people like to smoke in restaurants, it is natural for smokers to smoke during meals. To smokers, the habit of smoking while eating is sort of like a lifestyle, just like it is normal for non-smokers to not smoke while eating. So, I think that it is unfair for us to enforce our way of enjoying food to those that like to smoke while they enjoy food. Instead of arguing about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants, I think that it is important that we search for ways to have both non-smokers and smokers eat in the same restaurant without any conflict. We should keep the rule of having both smoking and non-smoking tables, and try to come up with new ways on preventing the smoke from the smoking tables, from reaching the non-smokers. Smoking is permitted in many places in Japan, and many non-smokers are not happy about it. However, banning smoking everywhere will not completely solve the problem, so it is important for us to think of how to make more tolerable environments for non-smokers.",B2
"In my opinion. I think the students will work part time to earn extra after school is not very important. If students do not have a financial problems. They should be study hard. When they have free time, they should read books or do other activity such as sport, music etc. But if a part-time job does not interfere with the time to read books or do other activity and students need to lighten the burden of home. It is better to work part-time job. We should see that their own ability. We have enough ability to learn, coupled with a part-time job without any study or not. Because at least. A part-time job is a practical experience of working with others as well. In case of students have a financial problems in the family. A part-time job is quite important because it will lighten the burden of home and earn income families to rely on themselves. So that parents do not have to worry about our expenditures. Moreover, there is also a self-trained to work experience, responsible for your work, trained themselves on time and working with others as well too. Therefore, a part-time job is important or not. It depends on several factors as well.",B2
"I disagree with this statement. At present, people who are alive longer than 20 years are not forbidden smoking by the law in Japan. So they all have the right to enjoy smoking at will. And of course they also have the right of using the restaurants. If smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, they cannot genuinely enjoy their own relaxed time - eating, drinking, chatting, and more. Recently the risk of 'passive smoking' has often come up as a topic that citizens have been interested in. It is surely the important problem for all of the people, especially they who do not smoke or dislike smoking may think about it seriously. But many restaurants already take the provision against this problem: setting up the smoking seat and the non-smoking seat. Setting up both of seats and choosing seat sitting, people either who smoke or do not smoke can spend comfortable time at a restaurant. This provision seems enough to enable all of them to enjoy eating. Banning smoking completely may be too hard for people who like smoking and deprive them of their pleasant. Smoking people should enjoy smoking with a manner toward other non-smoking people.",B1.1
"I am of the opinion that while it may be financially beneficial for college students to hold a part-time job, it is not of paramount importance that they should be employed. As a science student, my schedule is usually packed with lectures and tutorials during the semester. What little free time that is available to me will usually be spent with my family and my friends. Having started my final-year project about three months ago, my leisure time has dwindled to a bare minimal, such that even a simple dinner with my family is now a luxury that I hardly get to enjoy. Given the demanding schedule of college students, or at least that of a final-year science student, I feel that it would be difficult for college students to hold a part-time job. A part-time job requires a certain level of commitment and the lack of time is something that makes it extremely difficult for me to hold a part-time job. While the additional income would no doubt come in handy, I feel that the job of a college student is to learn as much as he or she can during the course of study and to channel his or her energy mainly to the pursuit of a degree. This itself may be viewed as a form of commitment. From this perspective, part-time jobs may be viewed as a form of distraction. ",B2
"Nowadays many people hold a pessimistic attitude towards college students' behavior, having part-time jobs. Whereas, as for me, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. First and foremost, it is a perfect oppotunity for experence-lacked college students to practice themselves. Part-time jobs open a new door for innocent students to touch and learn to adapt to the complex society, which can broaden their horizens and strengthen their abilities. Secondly, taking part-time jobs is also an approach to relaxing. As we know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy. Then getting along with various kinds of people and working in a group bring a fresh feeling during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can also earn money via part-time jobs, which can help to support their life and realize the hardship behind every coin. As to those excuses for denying part-time jobs, it is a waste of time and has a bad impact on study. I don't think they are according. As mentioned above, taking part-time jobs is meaningful, which not only strengthen themselves, but also make them mature enough to set foot in the society. As to study, what is known to all is that appropriate practice contributes to study by combining the theory to practice. All in all, taking part-time jobs should be encouraged among college students.",B1.2
"Smoking is a bad habit. It is not good for the smoker. Both of the active and the passive smoker get the negative effect. The active smoker actually broke his/her body, specially broke his or her lungs. The passive smoker who does not smoke directly also get the broken lungs. How can? It is because they breathe the smoke from the active smoker. Not only the cigarette but also the smoke cause the cancer. That is why, if we want to keep our cancer healthy, we must stay away from smoking. Do not ever smoke and make a space from the active smoker. Restaurant is a public place. It is for all the people without exception for eating or enjoying lunch and dinner. In a public place, we should have a good attitude. How about smoking in the restaurant? I think it is not polite attitude. As we know that smoking brings many dangerous effects, so we should honour the other people who are in the restaurant too. The smoker is still want to smoke but there are some people do not like smoking. In my opinion, the wise solution is the government do not have to ban smoking in restaurant but they should make a private place for smoker in every restaurant â€“ a separate room for smokers.",B1.1
" Some people hold the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I completely agree with that. Smoking is a really bad habit that makes many people annoyed. When someone smokes, he influences people around him. The worse thing is that it may cause more harm to others than to himself. It is their freedom to smoke, but people should not to do it in public. When you smoke in public, you also force the people around you to smoke. It would be impolite. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for our health. You don't care your health, but they do. On the other hand, it is not safety to smoke in public place. It will be dangerous if you throw the smoked cigarette everywhere. It is easy to cause a fire accident. In fact there are seas of fire accidents are caused by smoking. Also, many people would fell sick if someone somke around them when they have a meal. Restaurant should offer a fresh atmosphere for people to have a meal. So, it is necessary to forbid smoking in restaurant. To conclude, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.1
"I agree with the following statement ""It is important for college students to have a part-time job. "" I have some reasons why I agree with this statement. First of all, to have a part-time job teaches us the real value and importance of money. Before I started a part-time job, I got some money off my mother and my ground mother. And I bought books and clothes I wanted with the money. Then I sometimes bought something I didn't really need. But after I started a part-time job, I came to buy something I really needed carefully. For I learned how hard earning money was. I felt the money I earned by myself was very valuable. Secondly, to have a part-time job gives me a lot of experiences. I work as a part-time teacher. And I teach not only junior high school students but also primary school and high school students. Other part-time teachers are many kinds of peoples. They are college students, women who have children and men who got married. Therefore I communicate with many kinds of people. And I learn wide views from them because they have their own views different from mine. Thirdly to have a part-time job improve the way how to use limited times. I must do many thing-studying, listening to rock music, reading books, housekeeping, communicating with my family, and a part time job. So I came to plan by myself. And I always do something I must do now. For these reasons I agree with the following statement ""It is important for college students to have a part-time job. "" And I'll have many kinds of part-time jobs from now on.",A2
"Since most of the family's before face mild or extreme poverty, most of the students got part time jobs in restaurants, gas stations, grocery stores and etc in order to get proper education. They use their salaries to pay for their tuitions, books, clothes and other necessities. That is why dual roles of college students as part time workers and students have been common since our fathers ' time. I remember my father telling me stories about his experiences as a working student during his college years. He said that having the role of a working student was very hard because being able to maintain both his work and studies was a difficult task. There were times when he was exhausted from his work, yet he could not rest because he still had to do his assignments and study for the lessons. But after a period of time, he left his job in order to fully concentrate on his studies. Based on my father's past experiences, I can only say that part time jobs for college students may hinder their goals in getting good grades. Some students may say that they can maintain and excel both their academics and work, but there will come a time when their health might collapse due to exhaustion, extreme pressure and lack of proper sleep. Others may say that they will get part time jobs inside their schools as scholarship grants, but even this may hinder their grades because of the conflicting schedules. They may say that they will find time to finish both their assignments and jobs, but what if their classes are until 5PM and they have no long breaks? College students may take part time jobs as long as they can handle all the workload, manage their grades and maintain their health.",B1.2
"Smoking should not completely be banned at all restaurants in the country due to the following reasons: Smokers should also be respected by non-smokers; they can smoke in a specified area without bothering others. Therefore, there should be certain restaurants that allow people smoking and restaurant themselves could decide if they want to welcome smokers. Even if the Taiwan government has banned all indoor-smoking since January 2009, there are still some indoor facilities that welcome smokers, such as karaokes and clubs. If smoking is banned at all restaurants in the country, some restaurant owners might still welcome smokers in order to be more competent. Banning smoking is not the best way to decrease the amount of the smokers. On one hand, an implanted policy cannot resolve the problem at a glance. Perfecting the education system by giving more life lessons instead of only the solid information and academic knowledge, people would have become more self-conscious of their health condition. On the other hand, restricting smokers from restaurants could possibly result in more people smoking on the streets. It might be a potential cause for air pollution. To sum up, smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in the country is because that there should be a better way to resolve the problems caused by smoking and that smokers are not equals to criminals.",B2
"I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. There are some reasons. First of all, smokers smoke at restaurants is a kind of selfish behavior as restaurants are public place where contain many non-smokers. If smokers smoke at restaurants, the non-smokers will breathe in the secondhand smoke unwillingly. Actually, the secondhand smoke contains a complex mixture of different kinds of chemicals such as carcinogens. It may cause many fatal diseases to them such as lung cancer, nasal sinus cancer, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, etc. It seems that it is very unfair to the non-smokers. Secondly, smokers smoke at restaurants will contaminate the environment. It is because tobaccos smoke is a kind of air contaminants which will cause the environment being contaminated. If the environment is not good, how can people tolerate to have meal at these restaurants? What will the consumers do then? I think that they may not have meal at those restaurants anymore if they have choices which may cause the restaurants losing important income from those non-smokers. As smoking causes lots of problems to human beings and also the environment, hence, I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.",B1.1
"I do not smoke. So I take to about smoking that can be done is limited. But I hate people who smoke. A smell of cigarettes is nasty and hard. A lot of bad things that tobacco has in our body. . .

Smokes inside the building in many places. Passing by the place too hard. There are many smokers in our country. They pollutes many no smoker's am very upset, Smoking is indirect rather than direct smoking is bad. So I tried running away to smokers. I hope a lot of people smoked cigarettes decreased hope. Schools and many other places is active smoking cessation program. So I hope that helps people to receive such a place. My dad and hang up before you start smoking you can help. Smoking is really harmful to our bodies. This point will never change. It is to shorten the life of smoking. In addition, this point does not change, Cigarette smoking harm, nonsmoker to both people and involves. I will never learn to smoke. So Hope that all non-smoking,",A2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, it is a good opportunity for us to know our society well. When I finished the entrance examination of *** University, I started to work ice cream shop. I had thought that I could enjoy working, but it was much harder than I had thought. It was much harder than the study of examination in a sense. I learned many things while I was working at the shop. When I was selling ice creams, I involved with various people. I had not been good at communicating with people before I worked. However, while I involved with many people by selling ice creams, I could talk smoothly with people who I met for the first time. I think I could grow myself by having a part-time job. Thanks to a part-time job, I could have responsibility, and moreover, I can know the importance of money. I learned how hard it was to earn money. So, since I have started having a part-time job, I have not waste more money than before. Furthermore, we could make many friends in a part-time job. If I don't have a part-time job I cannot talk with a person who goes to another school. For these reason, I agree the opinion that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"Our great leader and founder of Pakistan QUAID ?E-AZAM said that Students are the back bone for our country Our country Pakistan is not very good in economic. People have not enough money to study their children's. So they don't to cause to go their children's in schools and collage. In our country the percentage of poorness is above 75%. Peoples have not enough money to cause to go their children in collages. They cannot afford the expenses of study. Those children who want to learn they do part time jobs at some places and afford the expenses of their studies. So the part time job is necessary for collage students. Due to doing jobs their confidence level is also increase which is very good for them. They have much power, confidence and strength to solve the problems. They can face any difficulties of their life. But for the collage students the jobs are those in which they don't work hard. If their jobs are tough than they do not take a proper time to their studies, which is very dangerous for them. Jobs are easy and cannot take a lot time of them. In this way they don't take a proper time to their studies. In some cases, parents of the students pressurize their child to earn money to support their family and they became a heddle in the way of their child. Parents do not pressurize their children's to earn money if they want to learn? Now our government has free the education up to metric level and provides the scholarship to girls. Now education became free up to metric level. They also provide books to students. So students can easily get education up to metric level. Part time jobs are done, when they are in collage and they don't afford the expenses of education. So part time job is necessary for students.",B1.1
"As is well-known and has often been described, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. From my perspective as a college student, I partially agree with the speaker and there are many instances supporting my view. The chief reason for my view is part-time job may increase our life experiences and knowledge. For instance, I usually find a part-time job in my summer vacation or winter vacation. During these days, I could meet many kinds of people who I never seen before and I could learn some things that I never encountered. On the other hand, I think that part-time jobs could influence students' study if these are excessive. Take an example from my country; many students discontinue their schooling because part-time jobs are so busy that they could not go to school. Finally, to understand the truth of part-time jobs is important for college students or not, it is also necessary to see the student's time management. Therefore, I think that the most important thing for students is schoolwork not jobs. To conclude, due to the above-mentioned reasons, it is not difficult to draw the conclusion that I partially agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"For the question if part-time job is important for college students, my answer is it depends on their social status and decision of their parents. For those students that belong in high-class society, it is not necessary for them to take any part-time jobs. They will just finish their studies and work or manage their own family business. For middle-class like me, some take part-time job for their own allowance, to help their parents for the expenses but there are also parents who never let and will not allow their children to take part-time job because their reason is they want their children to focus in their studies then find a work after they graduated college. For students that really need to work for their tuition, allowance, book fees and other expenses in school and in their houses, it is important for them to have a part-time job to help them for their expenses and to help their parents who working so hard just to enroll their children in a great school. Having part-time job can help us be responsible, know how to budget money and having part-time job during college can build our character. We will know how much the value of the money that we get from our hardwork. We will know how and we will spend it in important things. Lastly, college students that have part-time job don't need to ask for money from their parents for their own needs and wants like a gadgets, clothes, and everything else and that are less burden for their parents.",B1.2
"College students should have part time jobs so that they could help their hardworking parents pay for their chosen institution's tuition fee. Their parents may seem like they never run out of money but in truth, they do too. Imagine all the expenses they incur in sending their children to school, gas (if they use the car to send the kids to school) or transportation expenses, daily allowance, books, clothes, food, and so much more. With all the time a college student has on his/her hands, they could probably work for at least two to three hours a day and earn a few bucks to be able to lessen their parents ' load (in terms of money). It's the least they can do to help their parents. Ever since they were studying in primary and secondary school, their parents probably never asked for anything in return for sending them to school (except for good grades, of course). Now that they are in college, they should do this simple and easy gesture or working a few hours a day or a week to be able to give something back. They don't even have to pay for part of their own tuition; maybe they could pay for part of their sibling's tuition fee or not ask for daily allowances anymore. Simple acts can go a long way.",B1.2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many students have part-time job. It is popular in many students in teen-age. It make experience and make money for students. The college students interesting in use time for part-time job more than another activity. May be, the college students need to spend money for a lot of necessary. So, they need to fine more income. In Fact, student that have past-time job have the different from another student that have not past-time job such as times management, it is manage a time in a day and separate appropriate times. Moreover, students will get about how to live and adjust oneself for real life. It will make friend and relationship with anther people, that very important for the college students because part â€“time job like as preparation for work in future of the college students. But if the students cannot separate times and manage oneself, they will fall in the future. Part-time will good, if the college students can manage times of themselves. Part-time will bad, if the college students cannot manage times of themselves. Everything depend on self of the college students and individual of students.",B1.1
"It is very important for college students to have a part time job in another country if they are study overseas. Because in the foreign country, the student who studies in the college must have an experienced and want to earn some money to meet their requirement for their daily need. Another reason is the students who have a part time job is understand how hard to earn a money. Usually the students spend their money to buy something that useless for their daily need; they buy for their prestige only not for their requirement. Another reason is not everyone in this world are rich people. If your parents are a very rich people, I think you shouldn't work part time because your parent can give all of your daily need. But if your parents have a little bit finance problems I think you must have a part time job to reduce the payment for your College cost and your cost for daily needs. I think it is depend in the college student situation because if you study overseas the living cost and your daily needs are very expensive. But if you study in Indonesia I think you shouldn't have a part time job because the salary is very cheap and can't meet your daily need.",B1.2
"What do you think about smoking in the public places? I think it should not be allowed. Refer to many years researching, the result that; almost of the people think negative about it. Do you know? More than 80% of the restaurants in Thailand have been banned the smoking and if anyone smokes they will be fined for 2, 000 baht. But in the past time, smoking has been allowed for every restaurant, pub and club. That was very uncomfortable for the people who are a non-smoking person. They would inhale the smoke and get it more than the smokers. Right now there are the ways to solve this problem, the first one is fine and the second is set the smoking zone in the public places and restaurants so far from everyone. Smoke, there are many toxic and disadvantage, that is the good idea to protect ourselves from that. I'm very sure that you want to be happy when you have a dinner with a fresh air without smoke, smell bad and toxic. I don't blame that the smoker is the bad person but your smoking is affected to the other people and makes the people around the smokers get the carcinogen, Of course it should be completely banned!",B1.1
"I agree because they can learn some basic financial skills such as budgeting, get some organisational skills and generally get to know what it is like to have to go to work. The big thing for me when I was working and studying was that I learned that I had to be responsible but more importantly, act responsibly. I could not just take off and go to parties with my mates when I felt like it. I did have some trouble with time management at first, but after my first few stuff ups, I managed to get it right, for the most part anyway. I was given no slack from my lecturers either although my boss was pretty good to me. I hear a lot of kids complaining and crying about how tough it is and I always think that they have no idea what tough is. My idea of tough is living in Afghanistan or Iraq or even Africa where people are shooting at you or you are dying from hunger. Now that is doing it tough in my opinion not working part-time and then sitting in an air-conditioned room at university or college with a fast food cafeteria downstairs. But then, I guess it is all subjective to our own experiences and opinions.",C2
"Nowadays, more and more students took part in some part time jobs. Some of my friends also took some part time jobs during the last summer after the college entrance exam. However, in my opinion, taking part time jobs is really not a brilliant idea. First of all, some kind of part time job is really a waste of time. For example, one of my friends who was accepted by a famous university decided to send leaflet during her part time. But as I think, no matter what happened, I really don't believe that a person graduated from that kind of school would have another chance to send leaflet. So he is just wasting his time. And someone would say that except for this kind of part time job, Other kind of part time job might be a kind of exercise. Unfortunately, I disagree with it either. As a student, the most important thing for us is studying. No matter how much part time job you did, the most important thing is still your studying skills. And another thing is, it can release the pressure of their family. I think, for some students whose parents are not as rich as others', this might be a way. But it's just a way, not a perfect way. Not to mention those who can afford the cost of college. After all, as I just said, you have to put your studying time into pieces to participate some part time jobs. It will certainly affect your studying. So for those whose parents can afford their college life, I think it's better toyou're your mind in studying to make more money for your parents and yourself. So I think this is it, my opinion of part time jobs.",B1.2
"Smoking was never beneficial in ones ' health; this may lead to lung cancer to not only the users but also the people that surrounds them. The restaurant is for the public where the rich and the poor may interact. It is also the place where people can smoke freely. Morally speaking smoking in a public place is definitely shows no respect to others. Health wise smoking would greatly affect the people that surround it. For me, smoking in Public places like the restaurant must be banned for it shows no positive side in using such thing that would affect the people. The smokers who do not follow the law must pay the consequences. They must undergo seminars about how smoking can affect the life of many. They must also be fined with proper amount. Violators who didn't seem to learn and continuously do such action must be placed behind bars. The seemed law may seem to be too harsh for a minor mistake but a person would only learn if they don't learn it the hard way. They will continue smoking in public areas until someone like the authorities would confine them for their own actions. Smoking only leads people to sickness.",B1.2
"I believe that it is important for university students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. First, as university students must pay the expensive tuition and use money for lunch or transport fee, so, they can do a part time job to lighten the burden of their family. Moreover, having a part time job can get some experiences. The university students can choose the part time job that can help them to prepare their future career. These experiences can widen their view. For example, if they be a tutor of the primary student or secondary student, they can learn how to teach children and how to prepare material for the children during the lessons. In addition, being a university student is not same as a secondary student, so, doing the part time job is a addition task for university students to arrange their time table. In the university, there are some job for them to do, for example, being a librarian or being a helper of some program. They should use these few years to learn how to arrange their time table that not same as secondary school. In conclusion, having a part time job is important for university students.",B2
"People say that college life is one of the most important events of one's life. It is the point wherein the students will be trained to act like adults. In my opinion, college students should not have part-time jobs simply because they should be focused on their studies. Having a part-time job will decrease the time one can spend on studying because it will be really hard for the students to manage their time and will also make you feel tired due to the extra effort the student has to exert. If, for example, the students will go to school from 8:00am to 4:00pm then will work part-time for 3 hours a day, that will leave them with only a couple of hours left to study and do the assignments. But you also have to take in to consideration that they will still have to eat and travel going home which will decrease more of their time to study. On the other hand, if the students will proceed home after school, they will still have an ample amount of time to study and do their assignments. If the people really want the students to have a part-time job then I would suggest that the students should do it during the summer where they do not have to worry about school.",B1.2
"Every time when people are having their meals in the restaurants, it is not tough to find that some people are smoking in the nearby. People who are near to them are forced to have their meals together with the second hand smoke. This really makes the non-smoker customers get mad. In my point of view, I also support that we should ban smoking in all restaurants. First of all, smoking is a harmful behaviour which affect the smoker and others who smoke the second hand smoke healths adversely. Of course, those smokers may think that they do have their freedom to smoke in any place they want, including the restaurants. Neverthless, should we scrafice both smoker and non smoker healths just because of satisfying those smoker desires? Why do we need to intake second hand smoke, which is the things we hate of, together with our meals in the restaurants? Moreover, there are many place for the smokers to smoke instead of the restaurants. They can go to the smoking area if they wa nt to smoke, so that they can satisfy their needs while on the other hand, without troubling to other non smoker people. Wouldn't this be better than smoking in the restaurants, which make many people get mad? Actually, smoking isn't a good habit at all. There is no doubt that we should ban such kind of behaviour in all public area, not only in the restaurants.",B1.2
"Smoking in restaurant is so bad behavior because it is a place that many people join in this place. So, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country for three reasons. The first reason is that it disturb the happy time for families. Many families go to restaurants for new and clean atmosphere but someone is smoking, their happy time can stop. The second reason is that it is bad for health. We know that smoking is bad for health both who smoke and don't smoke especially children and older. Because in restaurants have every age. The third reason is that it is dangerous if cigarette still have fire. In restaurants have a lot of woods that is the good material to build fire. So that it can destroy the restaurant and much life. Finnally, many people hope a restaurant is the place that can give them happy time because restaurant's owner provide many facilities for their customers. Then costomer trust in service. If some people smoke in a restaurant, for sure that it can destroy a good atmosphere in a restaurant. Moreover, it is not only destroy a good atmosphere and harm customers' health, but also the accident by cigarette can happen all the time. So, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country.",B1.1

"Smoking is a bad habit. It causes dangerous diseases. Especially it causes respiratory disorders lungs and also damage due to smoking because cigarette contains many harmful par ticks, cancerous Patrick. Smoking does not affect those people which are surrounding them. It particles also moues in air and cause the air pollution. In the west it is adopted as fashion but now also in Pakistan. Now only man, woman and young boys and girls also pass through this temptation. Usually the habit of smoking is passed through bad companies. Smoking is very common in Pakistan. It is destroying the future of Pakistan. Restaurant is very common and public place, smoking should be banned here. But now in restaurant shisha mane tool is used as a fashion.

"Students of university was studying on university and take a specific department. Some of college student getting part time job to fulfill their daily need. They think from part time job, they can learn and practice what they get from studying in university. College students learn from their par time job was working on the real life. Part time job was useful for their life. Many kind of part time job, for example be teacher, service and program computer, etc. when the collage student take a part time job, they can useful their time, of course with their heard to do that.

Beside can practice what collage student get from studying in university, we can getting money too. If there are some people asked, part time job important or not for students of university or college students? I will answer, yes it is. Part time job was important for collage student. The collage student can practice what they learn in university, they can learn how to working in real life not know inside of campus and they can getting money for fulfill their daily need.",B1.1
"It is quite normal to see so many warning signs around the public, saying that smoking is banned with the maximum fine of ten thousand dollars. Being a guy who hates smoking and people who smoke, I strongly insist smoking should be banned in the restaurants in my country. According to the news and research, people who inhale the second-hand smokes would get more chances to get the lung cancer than those who smoke, so this issue has been controversially discussed and regulated. Because it has to do with people's health and rights to get healthy, I believe in the regulation of these rules. In my memory, I once had a quarrel with an old man who smokes publicly in the department store, and he was scolded to silence by me and the passer-by. In the long run, he put out the smokes and ran away with understanding the severe consequence a smoker should deserve. Recently, the complete ban to smoke has been carried out in campus around the country as well, showing that smoking in public places in not available Nowadays. Consequently, I would clap my hand and applaud for the ban of smoking in the public places, especially restaurants, and in that way everyone can enjoy the delicious food and ""healthy"" surroundings without any detriment smokes bring.",B1.2
"Part-time job is a good one to get money it is not hard work. Almost everyone can do it, we can make more money and we don't have to ask our parents for money. I think it is a good one for college students. It's a good job for college student because it does not have to work in class time, and the most important one is we can help decrease our parents' expense. Part time job is just a part of college life, we have to pay attention in class belong with the part-time, it would be the best. People who tend to get the best job more than other people are people who have more work experience. Due to human responsibilities, students who study in a university should already have abilities to live by themselves. That is they should do a part-time job. When they graduate from the university, they have to find a job. Therefore, while they are studying in the university, they should have a part-time job to train them before getting the job in the future. Moreover, having opportunity to have a part-time job while they are studying in the university is a good chance to get a job in the future. Many managers want people who have work experiences to work in their company. As a result, if the students have experiences about the job while they are studying in the university, it will help them a lot to get a good job in the future. Additionally, they can help their parents to save find and money while they are studying in the university. So, I agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.",A2
"In my opinion, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. When I was a child, my parents told me that what I did after class should not just all about class. I should do something special and different to realize the world. They said that you won't be a student forever. You should learn something useful for your future life. The reasons why I agree that having a part-time job for college students is important are following below. First of all, my parents said that our life can't only study so having a part-time job is a great way of not just studying. Besides, someone having a part-time job can earn money. It's a way for students to earn money on their own. They can learn how to take use of their money. The last one is that when we have a part-time job, we can make friends with more people. You can learn many things from them by chatting, and learn more about the social. I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. It's a great way to know more about the social. By the way, though I think having a part-time job is important, I still don't want to see that students give up their school works.",B1.2
"According to the Chinese governments' announcement, smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country since Jan. 1, 2011. People have been discussing heatedly heather this ban should be taken into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial to them. But for smokers, they think it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, for many customers, who spend much money in going to the restaurants, they just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time here, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second hand smokers. On one hand, the burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxic hazards to life, among which the nicotine is the largest killer that can increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer greatly. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smoker experience psychological harm as well, when they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety is increasing. Eventually, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the litter of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, mo smoking, no crying!Taking all the factors into account, I stick to the ban that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.1
"Today, some restaurants remove a seat of smoking section. I agree with this plan. A restaurant is a place for eating foods. In the restaurant which we can smoke, a person disliking the smoke has to endure it during a meal. It is only pain for him to eat such a place. If you weren't a smoker, you would feel unpleasantness in a smoky room when you're eating. Even if it established both a smoking section and a non-smoking section, the smoke has spread all over the restaurants in the end. For another reason, it's given a policy of Japanese government for the past several years. They have assumed a severe attitude toward Japanese smokers. So the smoking population of Japan have gradually decreased in the last 10 years, and it is said that the smoker of the current Japan is about 27, 000, 000. I think the restaurant also contributes to decrease Japanese smokers. In other countries, not to mention all the seats prohibition of smoking at the restaurant, it even becomes no smoking space. Smoking is not good for health. It causes some fatal disease. In addition, the smoke gives harm to not only the smoker but also others. I think that Japan learn such countries.",B1.2
"I think working part time was very important for students because they can divide his time in study and work. Unlike students who work while in college. many work part time for the student if the student is fond of the job. In working part time, students also taught to work together within the existing work in the office, thus educating a student to become a good worker, because of course very different from the work. was working part time when in accordance with our interests then going to more enjoy. And most important of here after college certainly does not become unemployed again because it can work. And even if to a new job, more adaptable because it was familiar with the work. In work part time, students also get a salary from the job so that educate students to become an independent and did not bother parents. To be able to share time in study and work, the student must get rid of laziness to perform all the work. It also discipline in the division of time in study and work for all jobs run smoothly, without any obstacles so that makes a worker can perform the job well.",B1.1
"I agree. Having a part-time job is an important experience for college students which will give them valuable skills and help prepare them for entering the workforce after graduation. First, students seeking part-time employment will get acquainted with the process of gaining employment: finding job openings, filling out a job application, and interviewing. Looking for work usually involves searching online, scanning classified ads in a newspaper, asking friends and relatives, or visiting businesses directly and asking if they are hiring. If the student is interested, he or she needs to fill out a job application and arrange an interview. Interviewing for a job is an important skill as it's a necessary step for every job they will apply for later in their lives. At the job interview the applicant should try to make a good impression. He or she needs to look professional, be courteous, and answer questions in a thoughtful and positive manner. Second, if students are hired they will need to deal with the responsibilities (and stress) that goes along with a job: learning new skills, performing job duties, getting along with their boss and co-workers, interacting with customers, and coordinating their work and study schedules. Juggling part-time work and school can also teach students valuable time management skills. Lastly, students can acquire job skills and earn money. Most jobs will involve the chance to get some training and learn some news skills, whether it's waiting on customers at a restaurant, handling money as a cashier, or selling shoes in a department store. Any money earned can be used towards paying rent, bills, tuition, or for savings. In conclusion, it's clear that college students with part-time jobs learn important skills and will be better prepared for the job market after graduation.",C2
"Nowadays, Just money from parents that we get everyday may not enough for us to survival and doing daily routine. In one day we use money to doing many activities such as eating, pay for buy or taxi to university; some of student also pays money for playing games and their girl friend. So they need to find another ways to have money not just from their parent, and that way is to have a pat time job. Some of college students have a part time job when they have free time to make money. I agree with them because we can ease burden from our parent and using free time to make a benefit. They job can be service, cashier at restaurant or supermarket, some of them are smart can be a tutor teach other student when it nearly exam. We can choose part time job from our skills and abilities. I think it up to them; if their parent has good status and rich, they don't have to do a part time job. But for other students that their parent has lower status and money in each day is not enough, they need to survive and help themselves. Students that have part time job need to manage their time for working and learning.",B1.2
"In the college, there are many activities to do such as learning subjects, doing researches, making appointments, testing quizzes, reading papers, etc. The college student should do activities in the college because they will be helped the student can learn, play and work together appropriately. Some department of the student college is hard to pass graduated and get good grades. Because the student may spend many time or share time in period. That is not the college period such as weekend, holiday, long holiday, Sunday, etc. They might divide time properly and use time co together with the other such as friends, teacher, place, etc, In my opinion, having a part-time in Thailand is not important for every college students. The student should do main tasks and there are many activities before more than have a part-time job in student lifestyle. If you have the certainly free-time, you may do a part-time job. I think just only do activities of the student department and college, it is enough for the college student so It is not necessary for having a part-time job in the college student. Part-time job, it can do every time but tasks and activities in the college may do only once or certainly time. Part-time may make you waste your effective progress in the student college.",B1.1
"Smoking is the biggest health problem in many country. Smoking is very dangerous to health the smoker and people around the smoker have a dangerous too.

"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I state the reason now. First!! Use the time effectively! College students comparatively have more free times compared with a member of society. Time is precious if we spend the time wastefully. Therefore, we have a part-time job. By doing part-time job, we get money. We will be able to go shopping and to the movie by the money in next free time. This cycle make the time effective. Second!! Get money that we can use freely. We can buy many things (car, house, jewelry, clothes, bags, plane ticket, and so on) which we want no matter how it is much by the money. Third!! Learn society I think that to learn society is most important when we are at university. To learn society means that we acquire decency and learn communication with seniors or juniors in business. We can do them by part-time job. Surely, a way of learning society is not only part-time job. But, it is the most suitable because it is the nearest to the society on the point of business. Some people may argue that we neglect study. I think so too. But there are many merit of supplementing it. So, I agree to have a part-time job.",A2
"In some countries, people are no longer allowed to smoke in many public places and office buildings. While some countries are having a discussion smoking should also be banned in restaurants or not. In my opinion, if smoking is not allowed in the restaurant then it is quite good rule. There are some reasons to express what will support my ideas. They are as follows: smoking is not good for health. If a person who has the habit of smoking then he or she can have breathing, lungs and heart problems. The smoke of cigarette is also very harmful for health. If people smoke in public places then it is not only injurious for the smoker but also for others who do not smoke. For a healthy life, smoking is not good. The smoke of cigarette has toxic metals like Cadmium. If human body contains excess of cadmium then it creates many health problems like bone and heart diseases. But smoking in the restaurant will cause both the smokers and surrounding people facing with those problems more than public places. Because most restaurants have more narrow areas and less air flows than public places. The people in the restaurant will be able to get more toxic metals than the people who are outside the building. The restaurants have no fresh air inside the premises and there are many who do not smoke, but they are forced to inhale the smoke let out by smokers, so nonsmokers can suffer from nausea due to lack of fresh air. As the result, for the safety of humans it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurant as well as in public places and office building.",B1.1
"I disagree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants in the country. Firstly, it is not illegal to smoke cigarettes. These days the places allotted for cigarette smoking is being reduced all the time. Even smoking outside is banned in some areas leaving people who want a smoke with nowhere to go. Since smoking is an addiction and people are going to smoke one way or another, it is better to designate an area for people with similar tastes rather than to force them to take drastic measures. A restaurant that banned smoking would find cigarettes blocking up their bathroom toilets with the smell of smoke there as well. Since both non-smokers and smokers both use the bathroom there is a chance of losing the non-smoking patrons due to stinky bathrooms. Secondly, smoking is one of the last good population control tools legally permitted and actually advertized. With global warming and world over population and with the advances in medical technology, if we don't leave a few deadly vices for people to do themselves in with, we may find ourselves going to restaurants and not finding any food left. So build a wall, put in a glass partition and let the cool people have their smoked dinners.",C2
"I agree with the assertion that having a part-time job is important for college students. As college students enter into adulthood and lead independent lifestyles, it is only natural that their expenditures will increase. It would not be fair to burden one's parents and ask them to continue to provide pocket money for these expenditures, especially if they are nearing their retirement years. After all, our parents have taken good care of us since birth, and as mature college students, we have the onus to repay our parents by showing that we have indeed grown up to become smart and self-sufficient young adults. College timetables enable students to have a certain amount of flexibility in working part-time, and students can choose different types of jobs that fit their lifestyles. For instance, they can give tuition ad-hoc, which may be less demanding than waitressing at a restaurant for 20 hours a week. Even though they may only earn a few hundred dollars, it can still enrich their family's income and take a burden off their parents, especially if the family still has younger schooling children. However, though I recognise the importance of college students having part-time jobs, this is not always possible. In reality, many companies are reluctant to hire part-time workers as they perceive them as non-committal. Nonetheless, I still advocate for the value of part-time jobs, as it enables college students to gain working experience and have a taste of working culture, which may benefit them in their future employment prospects.

"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons for it. First, they can learn some social manners by it. Second, they can learn the ability of communication through it. Third, they can understand how hard it is to get some money. The social manners and the ability of communication they learn from it help them when they graduate their college and get their job. The understanding of difficulty of getting some money will make them to thank their parents. Finally college students need a lot of money. For example they need money when they go lunch with their club members or they go shopping. They have to make money by themselves for their enjoyment. Therefore I think a part-time job is important for them. In fact, I will start a part-time job next month. The reasons why I start it is also the above some reasons. Especially I would like to learn the ability of communication and I would like to understand how hard it is to get some money. And I want to use the money I get for shopping. People who disagree to the statement may think that students only have to study hard. But studying on the desk can not teach them some social manners or importance of money. There are many things which are learned only by working.",A2
"In this modern era, the economic problem to be obstruction for university student because it is never they think before. The expulsion of university students is many, in the other hand they spend a lot of money. In the university, they must pay for many kinds of necessity. For example pay expense or campus, pay for their dormitory or their boarding house and their daily needs like food and other. In the university they have start to think can decrease their parents dismissal joining in par time job is one solution for university student to help their parents expense. In common, many university student join in part time job. Especially, for them who are study in private university. They can study well while joining in part time job. They go to office or their place for work in the morning and go home in the evening. After that in the evening also they go to university for lecture. It is very possible for them. They also got many advantages from join in part time job. First, they can help their parents to decrease the expense in university. Second they can get many new knowledge. Third they can improve their ability in the specific area. Fourth they can try manage their time. Actually, skill many advantages of university student join in part time job. This is opportunity for them, so this is good for them than just spend their time in boarding house. Many job that very suitable for university student, such as being a private teacher and other. There is no reason for university student to not try to join part time job. We have to make sure our mind that this is good for university student.",B1.1
"I do not agree smoking in restaurant No, I do not agree smoking in restaurant because smoking can make poor your healthy. I don't agree smoking in restaurant because can make young people or children poor healthy or can make poor old people healthy. Smoking in restaurant can make angry consumer or waitress or waiters because smoke cigarette can make sick in eyes, cough and sick in nose. Smoking can make many poor healthy for example sick in eyes, cough, sick in nose, the dead infant, impotency, sick in lungs, sick in heart, sick in kidney, cancer lungs, cancer kidney and any more and it is sick example for positive smoking and now example for negative smoking for example sick in eyes, cough, sick in nose, the dead infant, impotent, sick in lungs, sick in heart, sick in kidney, cancer lungs, cancer kidney, go old, wrinkled, white for hair and many more poor healthy. In money smoke can make wasteful because price one cigarette the same price rice for today. Do not believe to sponsor cigarette because sponsor cigarette is very lie and make poor healthy for customer. Do not believe the people saying you do not gentlemen because you do not smoking because is very lie and make poor healthy to people. You can believe saying doctor don't smoking because can make poor your healthy.",A2
"I agree this statement. This is because an experiment to have a part-time job will be useful when you work in the society. For example, if you have a lot of kind of part-time jobs, the experiment will enable you to talk about a lot of kind of subjects and you will become a popular person. If you have a part-time job at a convenience store, you will meet many kind of people, for instance the old, a woman who have children, a high school student and of coarse other college student. Then you will be able not to be afraid of talking with any kind of people. If you have a part-time job at the place where is the same kind as the place where you want to work, you will be able to know the job which you want to do. These experiments will improve your talent and you will grow up as human. Then you will get a weapon which you can use in the society. People who do not have a part-time job cannot get it. This difference is very big. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"Smoking is a practice where a substance is burned and the smoke is inhaled. It is usually done by people who are stressed, tired and needing to relax. They also smoke for recreational purposes. Smoking is dangerous to one's health, as it leads to numerous diseases like lung cancer, heart attacks and other vascular problems. It not only endangers the health of the smoker, but also those who inhale the smoke. It is known as second-hand smoke. I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants across the country. Restaurants are usually closed spaces and therefore smoke from cigarettes may not be easily dispersed to the outside air. The smoke may stay inside the establishment and be inhaled by non-smokers. The smell of the smoke may deteriorate the mood of the restaurant's customers. It can destroy their appetites because of the foul smell it gives and it may even distract them from eating at all. Banning smoking at all restaurants in the country can make sure that it can provide the appetizing atmosphere that a restaurant should have. Eliminating smoke from these establishments can generate approval from non-smokers and may increase their revenue and customer base. Also, used cigarettes and its ashes scattered on the floor will no longer become a problem when cigarettes are banned. Along with the current ban of smoking in public places, banning smoking in restaurants will help reduce the places where people can smoke and might even reduce their overall consumption of cigarettes. Therefore, I strongly believe that implementing a complete ban of smoking in all restaurants in the country. It not only protects the restaurant's appetizing atmosphere but also take care of its customer's health and dining experience.",B1.2
"Imaging your are enjoying your delicious meal when clouds of smoke surrounds you and a heavy smoker right beside you speaks out, whose breath is of tobacco. How will you feel at this moment and this place? You certainly lose your appetite and intend to escape from the man as soon as possible, will you?For me, I think that under no circumstances should smoking be allowed in public places, such as the restaurant. Reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smoker and the second hand smokers are risking their health even their life on the cigarette. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious that it our duty to value it. Therefore stay away from the cigar not only for yourself but also for others surrounding you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others present is a bad manner, which not only make an awful impression on others' mind but mislead the children to regard it as an acceptable or even a cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in the public place. In a word, let's create a smoke free atmosphere to enjoy our meal. Seriously speaking! No smoking at any restaurant in the country!",B1.1
"It is a duty of a college student to learn how to get money and use it. Also, it's a right that college student have to enjoy the chances of experiencing several jobs. First of all, college students have to learn to live for themselves. They have to practice how they earn money and how they should organize their money for their adulthoods' life. When someone was in a junior-high or a high school before he or she go to a college, they might had been fed by their parents. Except only some cases of people, parents usually support their kids when their kids are in their adolescents. They didn't have chances to prepare the adulthood. Therefore, college students would better have part-time jobs and learn to control the economic parts of their life. Secondly, only when people are in their college students' age, they can do variable things with small burden. If they graduate from the college, they have to be employed or find their professional. They don't have chances to experience something with that small burden. Therefore having a part-time job is a kind of right that only college students can access to it easily. It is important and necessary for college students to have part-time jobs.",B1.1
"I am strongly against smoking, so I agree with this proposition. This is especially so as restaurants are usually confined areas and there is a higher chance that second hand smoke would be inhaled. Studies show that second hand smoke causes more harm than the damage done to the smoker. Smoking is harmful but smokers tend to be overconfident that harm would only fall upon others, and not upon themselves. Restricting places where people can smoke may aid in discouraging the frequency of smoking, as well as discourage non smokers from picking up the habit. However, restricting smoking may harm business, especially for bars or restaurants that caters to the overnight crowd. Food and beverage business is a competitive industry in Singapore, and while the governmental bodies have been encouraging entrepreneurship, this may be a great blow to some businesses and reduce their already marginal profits. Fights may also ensue when owners try to stop customers from smoking. If this proposition is to be past as law, it is important that enforcement could be carried out smoothly and successfully. Hence, I would suggest that the proposition be changed to include only family friendly restaurants, and not all types of restaurants. ",B2
"People always have different ideas even on a easy thing. On this point, some people have the idea that college students have to join a part-time job while other people disagree. Form my perspective, I agree with the former. The reasons are simple. First of all, the course of finding a part-time job is a challenge for these students. They will never imagine how difficult finding a job is before you really find one. You will feel tremendous pressure in the job market at the same time. It can give you some help about how to persevere your determination of finding a job. Secondly, we can acquire some knowledge that will not exist in our classes. Some theories your teachers' deliver to you which you can put into practice are the knowledge you really obtain. Besides, on the one hand, a part-time job is not a heavy work and it will not take you a lot of time. On the other hand, you can earn extra pocket money. Well, in that case, why not?However, there are not always just some benefits. College students sometimes engage themselves into deceits because they are inexperienced in finding a job. But that's not all, some college students even take a part-time job as a reason for not concentrate on learning knowledge. In a word, we should have a proper attitude toward a part-time job.",B1.1
"I agree with the idea that we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Of course, smokers have the right to smoke, but they should not smoke in the place which smokers may trouble other people. Especially when other people are eating, the smoke makes other people have unwillingness to eat. I change my seat if there is smoker near me when I am eating. Besides, there is another problem. In the restaurant, there is place for smokers and for non smokers. We can choose the room we like to sit down, but in the almost all restaurants, there is nothing to have smoke kept in the room for smokers. As a result, the smoke comes to the room for non smokers. It is obvious that choosing the room is meaningless. Furthermore, cigarette smoke harm people who do not smoke. There are many researches which improve cigarette smoke will cause many kinds of illnesses. It can cause cancer which may kill people. Some foreign countries have already started to ban the cigarette in the public, such as school, station, airport and also restaurant. Japan has to ban smoking at all restaurants, too.",B2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are three reasons. Firstly, we can know what society is by having a part-time job. When we have a job, we need to care about the manner, clothes, way of speaking and so on. If we know about them, they will help us in the future. Secondly, having a part-time job would give us an opportunity to think about the future. This is because there are various kinds of a part-time job. We can choose whichever we want to try. Some part-time jobs may be interesting for us but some may not. And we can know about ourselves. For example, what we like or not, what skill we have or not. Then we would think what we want to do after graduate a college. We also think what skill we should gain in order to prepare for the future. Lastly, we have to communicate with people who we've never met when we have a part-time job. So we don't have a lot of chances to communicate with new people. There are many people where we work and they are from other cities or schools. We would find many differences between us and them. In addition, we can learn how to communicate well with people and know the thing we don't know. Therefore I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B2
"I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons. First, smokers cannot eat out and enjoy with their friends if smoking is controlled at restaurants. These days smoking is prohibited at many restaurants and cafes. My family and some friends are also smokers so when I go out with them, we have to search the restaurants where we are allowed smoking. I let them smoke at least when we rest. Surely smokes may be unpleasant for people who don't smoke. However, if so, restaurants have only to part smoking section and nonsmoking section so I think smoking don't need to be banned. Second, if smoking is prohibited, people smoke out of buildings and town become unsanitary. When I went to New York, people smoke on the street because smoking is controlled at almost buildings. Therefore many cigarette butts are on the street. Accordingly that people are allowed smoking in the buildings is better than that street become dirty. By these reasons, I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The best way for smokers and nonsmokers is the way to part smoking area and nonsmoking area. If so, we can choose which area we stay and people who don't smoke also eat and rest comfortably.",A2
"Nowadays many countries in the world have passed laws to ban smoking in public places like restaurants. But some smokers still claim that their rights are infringed if smoking is forbidden in public places. However, most non-smokers regard the ban as good news. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned in all the public places such as restaurants, theaters and public squares. Fisrt of all, smoking is harmful both for smokers themselves and others. It is reported that every year smoking causes lung cancer and millions of death around the world. Secondly, smoking pollutes the air. Just imagine that you sit in a restaurant full of smoke, how can you enjoy your meal there? Besides, smoking is bad for the elevation of a country's image in the world. Mostly important of all, smokers must show their respect to those who don't smoke even if it's quite difficult for smokers to hold their smoking desire for a while. Because they have to stand on others' shoes. I think the world will be better than before. I believe if smoking is banned in all the public places, most of us will breathe in more fresh and clean air. And the health condition of all the people will be greatly improved.",B2
"I think I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is very danger in a lot of case. Smoker will think that they are only person who receive the effects of smoking, but they are wrong. They can hurting themselves and other people by smoking. People who stay around them such as their family, their friends, and people who they don't know would receive the effects like them too. Because there are smokers and non smokers in every places that some people have to breathe the smoke from smokers. These case is well-known as Secondhand Smoke. This is a very serious problem that happen in every countries all around the world. Smoking is not good for everybody's health because of many reasons. For example, it smoke can damage important genes that control about the growth which a direct causes cancer. Moreover, it can also cause lung diseases, kills brain cells, and it also have the effects about beauty such as woman's skin. Pollution is a most important reason too. Smoking is a cause and form of pollution because there is a lot of toxic gases from smoking that can damage the environment such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Because of these reason, smoking will have the effects to everybody. If it have smoking in the restaurant, it will make the restaurant bad. It must have bad smell from smoking that cause the bad atmosphere in the restaurant. No one wants to sit down and see smoke floating around their food and all the other people in the restaurant. Many people will not eat in a restaurant where they allow smoking. The restaurant will lose of customers, and it also lose of credits.",B1.1
"Smoking is very dangerous for health, as it can damage your lungs. Due to the infection of lungs, aspiratory system also greatly affected. Its smoke is very harmful and can be infectious not only for the smokers but also for the peoples around them. We can evaluate how harmful it is even from seeing the packets available for smoking, description against smoking that it should not be done and it is harmful for life and its great effect on life has been given on it. It's a kind of drug, once you become its victim it's difficult for the person or the adductor to get rid of it. It's a bad habit that becomes permanent and not possible to throw it out from the life. As it is harmful for the people's health so it should be banned at restaurants. Peoples went to restaurants for eating good and healthy food and many take smoking as a fashion but because of the bad effect of smoking food don't remain healthy, as its smell and smoke get included in the food due to which people got ill. Smoking is a major factor that effect health and life greatly. It's important for the sake of people's health and life smoking should be banned at least in all the restaurants.",B1.2
"I agree on working part-time of university students. I have some reasons why I agree on working part-time. Firstly, in university, we can study society with only books. With only books, there are many things that we don't know about real society. We had better really work part-time and understand difficulty of earning money, working with many people, and so on. Secondly, we students needs much money when we do everything. We want to do very funny things that we can not do in school days, such as traveling world, playing with friends, loving girl friend, and so on. These things cost much money, so we need much money. We may rely on parents, but we should live by ourselves as diligent as we can. Thirdly, we had better make friends as many as we can make. It is the most important thing in my life and school life. I suppose that student should not study but make more friends. Friends is more important property than food, water, money and so on. So, we had better part in working part-time, we should much more friends in not only university but also part-time-job. In such ways, let's enjoy school-days and make it very significant thing.",A2
"We usually eat outside at least one meal and we can see smoking people in that site. If you are a non-smoking person, you can eat cigarette smoke instead of the food. Recently, the article that people around smoking people are higher the risk for lung cancer than smoking people was announced. At least, if we are considerate people that think others than me, I think that we must not smoke at the public site like restaurant. Also by globalization society, there are a lot of foreigners in Korea. They have to eat Korea's food at Korea's restaurant. There are also people that don't like to smoke near them. If they who comes Korea because of love for Korea see smoking people at Korea's restaurant, they will think all of Koreans are impolite. And there are also children come with their parent. If we smoke in front of them, children weakened immune systems can be more harmful their health. And it can be impacted children's education purpose which improves Korea's future. I think you already know smoking is not good all aspect in our life. Although it is hard to quit smoking, why don't you stop smoking than to undergo hate eye?",B1.2
" Nowadays, some business say that nobody can smoke in offices and some governments try to ban smoking in all public places. In light with this phenomenon, there is a hot issue on whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country or not arise. No doubt, I choose without hesitation, because there are too many benefits about banning smoking that outnumber its disadvantages. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Imagine that if you smoke in the restaurant and others are eating, you not only pollute the restaurant atmosphere but also disturb others because you give much poisonous gas off into the air. Some smoking say that it takes away some of their freedom. If you can't help smoking, you may smoke in private, not in restaurant or public places. If all factors are considered, it is no difficult to conclude that the advantages of banning smoking in restaurants carry more weight than those of disadvantages. From what has been discussed above, we may finally draw the conclusion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. So let us take action from now on.",B1.1
"I somewhat agree with this. It's has both Pros and Cons to have a part time job. First I'll explain the good thing to have a part time job. I think most of student has problem about saving money. They earn limited money from their parents. So it's very necessary to have apart time job. It can help student in several case. 1. It can make students use their free time for advantage thing. When they finish class instead surfing the Internet, having a part time job. 2. It may help they learn new experience and skill of life for living in now and future. 3. It can make they are responsible and diligent. Second, having a part time job also has bad thing because some college student doesn't have enough time to have a part time job. They must study hard and do activities in their university and it is difficult and don't convenient to go to work because they don't have a car or motorcycle belong to themselves. Sometime some part-time job give salary unsuitable such as some part-time job may give a little salary despite student must work hard and maybe employer might threaten student and make them stress. but sometime student can have a part-time job if they have free time.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement. Part-time job is a good chance to experience the society for college students. There are many kinds of jobs we can try. All kinds of jobs will do something good for us in the future. Especially I think a job that we service to the customers, such as waiter, is important. This will help us to have an ability of good communication. Part-time job is also easy to start. We only call to the shop and bring a document of ourselves. We have such an easy entrance test, but most of the time we don't fail, and then we can start to work. It is really simple. Some people says college students should not do part-time job. They say Student's job is studying. I think this way of thinking is not wrong. However this could only say for high school students. College students are adults enough to think about themselves. We know what is good or bad, and what is efficiency or not. In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job, but only when we have a time to spare. Of course it is bad if we don't have time to study because we are too busy to work. How long and efficiency we work both are also important matters to think.",B1.1
"I don't agree with this opinion, and I have couples of reasons why I don't. So I will show you what they are like. First of all, it is true that smoking is such a nuisance for those who don't smoke. My mother really hates people with the habit of smoking. If she happens to take a seat close to a smoker, she will keep making a face till we leave the restaurant. However, no matter how non-smokers are suffered from it, I think that it should be up to smokers. I mean, we shouldn't rely on prohibiting thing but developing its moral. For the second, there is a growing number of non-smokers or ex-smokers these days, but it is true that there are still so many people who love cigarette. So I think it is not fare for them to banning smoking at all restaurants. And it is really a problem for the nicotine-addicts. For these reason I give, I don't agree with that opinion. I think we shouldn't be so radical. We should be calmer down, and give the problem a careful look. I think this problem is complicated, so we had better try to respect each other and each circumstance.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement. There are two reasons. First, I think that college students should earn money to buy something they want by themselves. Indeed, their parents spend much money for their food, clothes and lessons in college and so on. But, in fact they are enough to earn money by themselves. So, I think they should not depend on their parents very much. Moreover, they are able to understand importance of money and how difficult their parents work to earn money for them everyday through a part-time job. Second, experience of a part-time job shows them a lot of things. For example, they are able to learn how to communicate with other people such as their boss or customers. After they graduate from college, most of them must work in society. If they didn't experience a part-time job, they may be at a loss when they are in trouble in their company in the future. They are also responsible for their job and they come to think more that they should not be late than when they go to college to attend the class. A part-time job is useful in living in society and makes them grow. Therefore, I think it is important for them to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I don't agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Of course there are both good aspects and bad aspects in having a part-time job. I'm going to write why I don't agree with the idea by showing both good aspects and bad aspects of having a part-time job. Let me explain. They say young people can acquire far more things than older people in the same time. If we have a part-time job, we can get some money, and getting money from one's work is surely a happy thing. However, we can't actually have what we could have acquired if we had done something other than working. This is a bad aspect of having a part-time job. On the contrary, having a part-time job itself can teach something important to us. For example, through a part-time job, we can realize the value of money, or realize our parents' effort to raise us, know how we can give better service to the customers, or encounter many people and enhance our knowledge. Those are the good aspects of having a part-time job, and we cannot do those things by just reading our textbook or something like that. In my opinion, college students should regard their study more important than anything else. If we want to experience the good aspects of having a part-time job, I think it is a good idea to have a short term part-time job. However, I think having a part-time job regularly can sometimes affects the quality of college students' learning. Therefore, I think it is better for them to study as much as possible than to spend their precious time of youth working, unless they are in financially difficult state.",B2
"Today, we can see more and more young people smoking in the public places such as street and restaurants and so on. However, I don't agree with this behave. Some people think about complete ban of smoking in all the restaurants. I agree with it because it is a good idea to do it. There are two justifications listed below to support my argument. First, smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Smoking cause a lot of disease such as lung cancer and it harm the non-smoker more than smoker. When eating in a restaurant, the non-smokers have no place to go if smokers smoke around them. What's more smoke does harm the environment in the restaurant, it causes the air pollution and something else in the restaurant. How can you enjoy your meal if you eat in this restaurant?Second smoking may bring fire to people in the restaurant. It may cause fire when someone litter the cigarette around and the worst thing is the fire burn the house and hurt the people in the restaurant. So we should against smoking in the restaurant, since it brings a lot of bad things to us. Finally, I appeal to all people to give up smoking not only for you but your family members.",A2
"I think that smoking is very bad, because tobacco is not only destroying themselves but also harm those around you as well many people smoke because they think that a fashion of their friends and smoking is a good thing. Smoking useless because it destroys the body's systems. Such as the nervous system. Internal systems of the body such as liver, kidneys, lungs, smoking causes many diseases. Including lung cancer. Diseases of the respiratory system. And digestive system. Current smoking rates continued to grow, especially teenagers who are young and are still unable to earn money to buy your own pace. Negative effects of smoking every year sd will have died from smoking each year, 400, 000. People or maybe more than the annual government budget to pay the cost of treatment. Caused by smoking a lot. Danger of smoking today with over the past several times due to current smoking with nicotine and low tar cigarettes make people breathe deep into the lungs. Who live with smokers may be the same, we call this group the second-hand smoke smoke from smokers contained a small can of smoke into the lungs. Second hand smoking effects of smoking were broken. Smoking not only affects the smokers but also to direct others in the atmosphere. Inhalation of toxic smoke from cigarette smoke go by. Harmful as cigarette smokers. The effects of smoking on the people side enough. Example it's effect to children, expectant mother, spouses of smokers and to general people. Quit smoking can be to yourself and to those around you love smoking is not needed at all.",B1.2
"In Korea, while most students attend schools without a job, some students have part-time jobs. With the money, they do what they want, such as buying clothes. It is widely accepted that students should focus on their study, not a job. However, having a job has a positive influence on students First, students, at workplace, can learn what they cannot do in schools. In Korea, professors usually teach students only academic subjects, such as literature and physics. Even though these subjects are important in living a life, there are other important things, leadership or followership. In fact, it is difficult for students to apply academic subjects to social lives since these subjects are too theoretical. Therefore, after graduation, students who have not worked will have difficulty in dealing with their social tasks at their workplace unlike the ones who have had a job. Second, students can do various things with their money that they have earned from their jobs. Students with a job will make more money than their monthly allowance that they get from their parents. Parents do not give much money to their sons and daughters. Even if they give much money to them, students feel the lack of money. This is because they want to make up well and meet their lovers as well as go to trip with friends. Therefore, working at a part-time job, students can do what they really want with the money. In conclusion, since having a job can give students various experiences as I mentioned above, it is a good idea that college students have a part-time job.",B1.2
"Smoking is one of the activities that loved by the ones who like it, and hated by the ones who dislike it. For some people, smoking can relieve stress, especially when they smelling the smoke. Also, they feel like uncomfortable if they don't smoke for a long time. But, on the other side, smoking can be really annoying since the smoke polluted the surrounding air. This is why, most government banned smoking on some public places, like restaurant. And yes, I agree with this. There are some reasons why I agree with that. The first thing, the smoke can make other people feel uncomfortable. Why this is, I have already explained before. Also, inhaling smoke from smokers, known as passive smokers, is far more dangerous than if you smoke actively. Second, for the smokers itself, smoking can be dangerous for their health, as you've already knew. It can be from damaged lungs to the worst, death. Since the past, the disadvantages of smoking have already wide-spreading all around the world and the Internet. For conclusion, I strongly agree with statement that smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country. It makes other people feel uncomfortable and not good for health too.",B1.2
"""Smoking is injorious to health"" every one is known this proverb, but most of us not obeying this. This is the fact that the smoke of cigrete is very much dangerous for all human lifes, but no body take care for that. if we want to see the body internal side of a smoker, break the pipe of huqa and see the its condition, the same condition of smoker's lungs. in this modern era most young boys use ciggerate only for fashion, to show to girls. Actually when we inhale the smoke of cigrete we take a lot of NEKOTENE which very much dangerous for human health. some times it destroy the life, most of peoples use it to release the tensions, it is true tensions are released but many other diseases comes in the body which are too much dangerous as tension. All the above discussion is right but when we see the smokers they look like healthy from other normal peoples. And most of people deceive from them. those people ar looking healthy but actually they are not healthy, their internal sides are much dissolves like bones. And they have low determinations. Those peoples have low stamina. Their practical life is not so good. Both health and wealth are destroyed. I remembered a joke, a man was smoking cigrete at airport, a young boy say uncle if you save the money of cigrete, you have the owner of the above plane, man says! So this is your plane?. Boy! No man replied! this is mine! moral: never tried to be over smart:",B1.1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Many researches have already proven that smoking harm human body including respiratory and nervous system. Therefore, governments in many countries set the law to ban smoking in public areas. But the necessarity of banning smoking completely at all the restaurants remains controversial. Some restaurant owners in Taipei city put a emphasis that their restaurants are smoke-free. And most still are divided into smoking area and non-smoking area, even some do not restrict their customer smoking. Second-hand smoking is the most harmful passage to damage people health. And victims are always those innocent people who don't smoke but around some smokers. So we should restrict the smoking behavior happened at restaurants. But the question is whether restaurants should be regarded as a public area or not. We don't know government has the right to limit owners' way of conduction. In contrast, smokers would consider smoking should belong to the basic human right and law can't intervene into their life. In my eyes, it is not easy to determine the relationship between the restaurant and smoking. Since I still think smoking has no benefits to our health, we should ban this behavior in public areas. As for the legislative aspect, lawmakers have to solve this problem and keep brainstorming.",B1.1
"I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because it is inappropriate to smoking while someone is trying to eat a meal. A person who is not smoker can inhale the smoke and get second hand smoke which is a health risk. Smoking is already a bad addiction for many people, but it is also bad for the people that do not smoke. Many people today are dying because of lung cancer caused by smoking and or second hand smoke. Someone that smokes knows the risks of smoking and second hand smoke and therefore they should be aware who to smoke by and when it is appropriate to smoke and when it is not. Banning smoking in restaurants and other public places may sound easy but it is a challenge for some people because they can't even go a half hour without having a cigarette. Smokers say that they cannot stop smoking because they have been doing it for years and it is an addiction. They also say that the places where they usually smoke the most are in the restaurants, bars and clubs. They smoke here the most because they spend a couple of hours in these places.",B1.2
"I agree with the statement. But I have a term to have a part-time job. The term is that college students have to have reasons to have a part-time job. We students have much time we can use freely. In my opinion, students should do what they can do only now. For example, we can study what we like, we have dream and go ahead the dream. However, when we graduate from college and start to work, we will be limited by work. So time we can use will be little. It is not until I started to have a part-time job that I realized that how important time is. But, some students must have a part-time job to make money. For example, getting a car license. I think that college students have to make money by themselves. Moreover there are some students who use their time in vain. Such students should have a part-time job and they will realize importance of their time. In this way, we are different from our reasons to work. We are now college students. So I think that we must decide whether we should work or not. In this opinion, I agree with the statement. But if students try to work, they must have certain reasons to work.",B1.1
"I disagree with this position. First of all, I disagree on the grounds that there is no clear reason to pick on smokers. We smokers do not live in denial of scientific facts, we readily accept that smoking is not a healthy habit (it causes all sorts of lung and respiratory ailments). We are constantly reminded at work and at home that we should quit, preventing us from smoking with our afternoon coffee seems simply petty. I say this as I watch the person at the table next to me (on the other side of the glass wall now used to segregate the smokers) gulp down a massive steak dinner along with a few beers I guess I'd feel better if government went after overeating and overdrinking with the same enthusiasm as they seem to exhibit when persecuting smokers! An finally, I'm certainly not happy with the idea that smoking is bad for everybody (non-smokers included). I own a gun and like to go hunting, I'm very careful about not harming anyone in the process. I behave the same way when it comes to smoking: I make sure that my smoke does not bother anyone If only other smokers were the same way, this would not be such a problem!",C2
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in Japan is very good idea. There are two reasons why I think so. First, I don't like smoking. Of course, I don't smoking because smoking has much harm but don't have any merit. For other reason, smoking needs a lot of money. At these reasons, I don't like smoking. If I don't smoking but other people smoking near by me, the smoke may come into my breath. At this, smoking harm not only smoking people but also not smoking people. Now, smoking completely banned at all the university building. So, the same thing can do at all the restaurants. Second, smoker can smoke at the out of restaurant. If smoker want to smoke, he or she only pay the dinner's money and smoke at the out of restaurant or in one's car. Surely, there are smoking seat and non-smoking seat in the restaurant, but the air in the restaurant is a little staled because smoking seat and non-smoking seat are just exist in the same building. And the smoke has bad smell, so that is inconvenient for the person who wants to taste the dinner's flavor. For the reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at al the restaurants in Japan.",B1.2
"For me, the importance of having a part time job in college depends on the status of the person. As we all know, the status of the people in our world are not equal. There are people who are rich and there are also people who are poor. If the family of the students have enough income and resources to support their needs don't anymore need to have a part time job in college. Since having a part time job in college would just serve as an additional burden for them. Plus it is already no point for them to have a part time job since they are already enjoying their lives. In the case of the poor students who can't afford the expenses in college, whether they like it or not, they have to have a part time job if they still want to continue studying in college. Since studying college is very much expensive aside from tuition fees, there are also transportation fees, allowance, miscellaneous fees and others. Even though it is difficult and time-consuming, part time jobs can give them extra-income to support their expenses in college. Sometimes the wages of part time jobs are low but it would help them reduce the burden of their families especially, their parents.",B1.2
"smoking is one of bad habit that I hate most. When a smoker burns a cigarette, he begin to hurt himself. And if there is someone staying around him, he is smoking the second-hand smoke. Especially in public occasion, smoking maybe results in an even serious affection. That situation is always seen in most restaurants. Drinking and smoking seem to the most usual things on the restaurants' tables. However, there is not everyone want to smoking, and someone who cannot stand the smoking maybe in the restaurant. Consequently, I tend to Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. After all, the restaurant is public place. It is difficult to know whether everyone here doesn't mind your smoking here. It should be also considered that if smoking is really completely banned, what affection it can make to the smokers. Actually their smoking on table, in most case, is only a habit, not a necessary thing. Usually, seldom do they go on smoking when they are told not to smoke in the restaurant. So it won't result in much trouble for the smokers. Through the analysis between both sides of the smokers and non-smokers, I agree with the point that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"It is not rare to see many students are doing part-time jobs when they are in college. Moreover, it seems that more and more students are doing part-time jobs during recent years. I don't support the idea that college students should have part-time jobs. And I have specific reasons for not agreeing with it, which are explained in the following paragraphs. Having free-time jobs is a waste of time. Consequently, college students will have less time to do other things. I can think no better illustration of the idea than the example of my roommate. For instance, my roommate Sun who have six part-time jobs is always exhausted. He doesn't have time to study what he should learn and have no time to exercise. Obviously, it is bad for his schoolwork and his health. Furthermore, he even doesn't have a girlfriend. What a poor boy!There are many people in the world are cheaters. In other words, you probably work day and night and gain nothing. Actually, the situation is not rare, it is just one of many examples I have encountered. For example, my roommate is Liang. He works for a factory for nearly one year. However, the manager of that factory disappears forever. Liang gains nothing. What a gloomy world. From the above, doing part-time jobs may have many disadvantages, so I don't think it is good for college students to have part-time job.",B1.1
"In many public places, we can often note that some people are smoking while others around them holding their noses. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking in the public restaurants is a bad behavior which put other people's health nowhere. Partly, smoking or not is a private affair, which others are not supposed to interfere in. But when it comes to the public places, smoking influences more than smoker himself but all the people there. In the restaurants, the space is very limited and people hate smoking cannot enjoy their meals when other people smoke around them. Secondly, smoking does harm to the smokers health and may even cause serious disease. We can help the smokers to quit smoking by banning smoking in all the public places. I think that most smokers lack self control. So it is better to have some laws to ban them from smoking in the restaurants. In a word, no smoking restaurants can benefit not only the smokers but also the other people around. So I insist that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, for the public's sake.",B1.1
"I agree that college students have a part-time job. First reason, it is good for employers. College students have much advantage to be employed. They have more free time than others. They have strong power and high intelligence. And, they have strong eagerness which they want to get a job. They are great working power, which they have high potential ability. And, part-time job is low cost relatively. Many companies want low price working power such as part-time worker. It is good thing that many college students contribute working power to society. Second reason, it is good for college students economically. Many college students need much money for various reasons. If they work part-time job, they get wages in short time. It is natural that college students begin a part-time job. Third reason, it is good for college students to experience works. College students are located in front of adults. Part-time jobs get for them to experiences of works. If they have experiences of part-time job before they get a normal job, they can get the job smoother than without them. It gets advantage for college students to get the job. They are why I agree that college students have a part-time job.",A2
"In my case, Part time job is important to many university students. Doing part time job help more grow up man. And get a confidence. Near my friends, some guy never do part time job. And he provides all money from his parents. He spends money buying something. I think he waste money to buy cloth. I asked him 'Hey do you think are you waste money?' and he said 'I'm ok my parents is rich person.' That moment I recognized. He doesn't know value of money. If he tried to get money through working, He couldn't say like that. In this situation. Doing part time job help to recognize value of money. Money is very important. Using money is easy, buy saving or getting money is hard and painful. I tried to save money, I make a plan. But I can't do like plan. It was very hard and difficult. When I worked at coffee shop, I made a many kind of coffee. Some rude people called me 'hay' I felt very not good. Getting money is painful that I knew it. But through coffee shop part time job I learned that getting money is hard and painful. So I planned always to use money. That behavior is always help me",A2
"Nowadays, more and more college students are getting out of the school and do some part-time jobs while still doing their study. So, what's the reason? Apparently, it is, maybe not necessary, very important to do some part-time jobs. The importances are as follows:Firstly, as we all know, the college education pays more attention not to the practice but to the theory. However, part-time job is a chance for the students to use what they got at school and to change their theory into practice. Meanwhile, it can enrich their college life as well as improve their work abilities. Secondly, the students will get much experience through part-time job, such as how to get along with their boss and colleagues and how to develop the attitude to shoulder their responsibilities. The experience they get can do much help to their job finding after graduate. Finally, doing part-time jobs can help the students gain independence, especially the financial independence? Although it seems impossible, we have the desire to make our own living because we are already adults. However, we can earn some money if we do part-time jobs. Thus, we can ask for much less money from our parents, which can make us feel more independent.",B1.1
"In my opinion, the past-time job is very important for college students. First of all if we have a past-time job we will deduct a lot of money from my parents. Also, if we have we're mommy we are can pay some thing for we are family, we are parents and I. Secondly, if we have a past-time job we will spend the free times for the past-time job, that if we don't have a past-time job. Maybe we will spend the free times for the thing it bad for example we will spend the time for the internet all day all time, will spend the free times for the TV and Radio. Maybe, we me be use the duct and gambling. One reason that if we have a past-time job we're will have experience in that job and we are want to be flow to make that job in the future if you want. The last one if you can make money by your self you will feel so good and fell proud not with you but with your parents too. As you can see the past-time job is very important for college students and it can make you many feel many experience, So we should have a past-time job.",B1.1
"I think having a part-time job it's great. A part-time job help you increase your responsibility, patient, teach you how the world after graduation will look like, give you more money, more experience of life... etc. But of course everything has pros and cons. I think of finding a part-time job too lately and that's when I start to find more cons about it. First of all I will have to arrange my time for extra hours after study for whatever job I'd get. I will definitely have less time for study in the evening, less time to hang out with my friends, less time to spend with my family, less time for any activities, in any case less time for sleep. But if you plan to do anything in the future that connects with money (in fact in everyday life anything has something to do with money anyway) saving some money from now on wouldn't hurt you or anyone. Because money will always support you when somebody won't and with money you can do what you want or whatever plan you have easier. It is even better when you decide to save some money when you're only a student, a part-time job may not pay as much as you want it to be but it is money.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement, and I think that college students should have a part-time job. I have three reasons for this. First, they can learn a lot trough having a part-time job, and it will be useful in their future. For example, I worked at a Hotel as a service stuff in banquet. Through this job I could notice that it is not easy to earn money, and I felt appreciate to my parents, because they have worked for me since I was born. If I hadn't have a part-time job, I would never get such a feeling. This is one lesson from my working experience, but I believe every college student can learn something important through doing a job. So in my opinion, college students should have a part-time job. Second, having a part-time job gives them a lot of information about the occupation. Then if they have a several kinds of jobs in their university days, they can know what kind of jobs they really want to do in the future. I mean that having a part-time job brings happy lives for college students. Third, I think students have to have a part-time job, and earn money by their selves, because college students need a lot of money for trip, study, or play with their friends. However, they should not make their parents pay all of them. They should try to independent from their parents. So, they have to work in order to earn the money that they need. In conclusion, from these three reasons, I believe that having a part-time job is important for college students.",B1.1
"Because I think that college students have much free time and energy. In addition that they think get money and the effects of a part-time job are important. For example they acquire the communication, social ability and learn how the money is important and how hard get money is difficult. College also advises students to have a part-time job. It is the evidence that College also think having a part-time job is important. Actually, I have a part-time job four times a week and thirty-four hours in a month. And I realize what I want to do in the future and what kind of the jobs aren't much me. In other words experiencing have a part-time job helps college students to select lifetime job more smoothly. But having too many part-time jobs is not good for them. If students have too many, they probably couldn't study in college very well or don't attend their school. Also they might be able to keep up with the friends of their school by too many part time jobs. Result of that they might need a few years longer to graduate or couldn't graduate. Another bad effect is that get much money then they don't forget the importance of money. But it is very extreme instance so that the bad instance rarely occurs.",B1.2
"I agree with the statement. There are three reasons why I agree with that. First, people who smoke everyday often get bad health. For example, to feel tired every time, and to become cancer. If you were so, you can't live with happiness. It is very serious problems. To live healthy is the most important thing. Second, people around smoking people feel bad, and is also get bad effects. The smells are bad for non-smoking people. They can't eat dinner with peppiness. And the second-hand smoke is more dangerous for other than smoking people. It is more serious problem than the first or second problems. Finally, some smoking people's manner is bad. For example, after smoking, some people throw the trash out. It is also serious problem for other people. Some people might say that developing country people get money from making cigarette. It is true. If we ban smoking, their jobs are not needed. However, the job making someone to be bad health is the worst job. Smoking is dangerous, and is completely bad. It is better that buy others than cigarette. It is good for you, and other people. It is why I agree with the statement.",A2
"Global warming is now an alarming issue not only faced by the Philippines, but by the whole world. Smoking is one of the many contributions to the increasing effects of global warming. An effort the Philippines can make in order to slow down the irreversible effects of global warming is by banning smoking. The Philippine government should not put a total ban on smoking at once; however, it should start somewhere, and someplace. One of these places could be restaurants, very public places where people coming from all walks of life gather for numerous reasons. Starbucks, a coffee franchise that has found a developing popularity in the Philippines, has now banned smoking as part of its efforts to save the environment. Ethically speaking, I believe that smoking in restaurants and other public places should be banned in the Philippines because not everyone smokes. Some people, such as myself, think that it is rude to smoke near someone who is aware of the health risks brought by smoking and second-hand smoke. I have experienced eating at a restaurant where I was seated beside a smoker. I found myself losing my appetite as the smoker exhaled his foul smelling smoke in my face. Moreover, smoking does not have any proven positive effects on a smoker aside from the relaxation it brings; however, relaxation could be achieved through other activities that do not harm the environment and other people.",B1.2
Smoking is dengerous for healthy it make lung cancer although we do not smoking but smoke dengerous for your life too and it make dirty teeth and make every body hate you not only make you bad healthy but also make you pay a lot of money to buy cigarette and your family will leave to you so I think we should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country not only at all the restaurants but also ban smoking every place where's have many people especially children such as the park the mall the zoo the school the university the bus stop the hospital the temple the airport and we should ban and prevent our family to smoking so people who smoking should relized to people around them and you should smoking far away from risk place or they should stop smoking for yourself for your family and for every body around you if you want to stop smoking you can chewing gum or canby and you should exercise such as play tennis go swimming play badminton go shopping etc replace smoking because when you can stop smoking you will have good health and long life to make useful for other people.,B1.1
"Smoking, I think it is best to stop smoking. Smoking is bad for your health. If you continue to smoke, you always die from the effect of smoking. Smoking always cause lung disease, even cancer. Therefore, you should not start smoking. I try my best to avoid any smoking activity around me. It is because I hate the smell of smoking. I try to stop all smokers to smoke. However, many people argue that they can decide to smoke fewer. They feel that they can control themselves to not smoke more. I don't think so. You can easily find that it is difficult for smoker to smoke fewer. Stop smoking can protect the health of you and your family members who may breathe your smoke. You should know that your family membles are more easily causing lung disease when you are smoking. In my point of view, all smokers should stop smoke to protect your family members and frields. Smokers can use nicotine replacement products to help them stop smoking. There are several kinds of nicotine replacement products. They are small and convenient. Therefore, all smokers should use the nicotine replacement to start a health life and protect their lovers.",B1.1
"I agree that it is important. Students quite often think that everything should just be given to them on a sliver platter. Especially the ones that do not have to pay for tuition because it is being paid for by their parents. Having a part-time job would teach them that they have to do some work to get paid and that when they enter a company, their company expects them to do good work and perform their jobs correctly in order to keep their jobs. This would teach them some kind of work ethic and to have some responsibility. They would soon come to understand that they have to do this consistently and therefore, have some discipline and pride in the work that they do. If they don't do a good job, they will get fired and that is just the way it is. Having a part-time job while they are still at college will get them started on the right track towards keeping a full-time job when they get their degrees. If they get fired while they are still at college then it won't be as bad as getting fired from a full-time job and they can learn from the experience, continue their studies and move on.",C2
"That's what I think of upon seeing the word smoking. Tobacco contains a lot of poisonous substance. So it is universally acknowledged that smoking is not a good habit. Smoking alone is equal to suicide, and smoking in public is equal to murder. It's very impolite to smoke in front of people who don't smoke. Smoking will make people around feel terrible. It will destroy your impression left to others. According to some research, secondhand smoking is more poisonous. This is one of the reasons why we shouldn't smoke. Another reason is because it is dangerous to surroundings, too. A cigarette can cause a huge fire if not dealt with well, which will ruin all your properties and even end your valuable life. And the factory producing cigarettes is also dangerous to the environment. The factory will produce poisonous gas and water. To some degree, this is also harmful to human beings. Have you realized that there are not any good results if we continue to smoke? We will destroy our environment, our friends, our own life----as long as we don't stop smoking. What a terrible thing! Cigarette is not a good invention. It has murdered millions of people. It is our duty to stop smoking from damage more people, from now on!",B1.1
"ï¼© agree. Because I think a pert-time job helps us independent. And a pert-time job teaches me any things. About First reason, today almost Japanese student give money for college by parents. And some of them do not think paying money to collage. They do not study at all the time. they are playing. This situation is funny. They should more thinking about what they do in the collage. So, I think part-time job chance they think. About second reason, I feel so very much. Pert time job link various people, example young and old. They have owed thinking. We study several ideas. If college students to not have a part-time job, they do study? I do not think so. Almost students will be idle. I think they need to have purpose. Example, a man who is an idle student made have a part-time job by his parents. He keeps doing. He saved up money. Then he must thinking. About First reason, today almost Japanese student give money for college by parents. And some of them do not think paying money to collage. They do not study at all the time. they are playing.

" Should smoking be forbidden in public places? I strongly hold the opinion that it must be stopped. There do exist uncountable harms of smoking in the public and I'm urged to see the ban against smoking in practice in a larger scope. As we all know, smoking does harms to our body and ruins our health. The smoker himself or herself inevitably suffers from the poisons that exist in the small cigarette. And on the other hand, people around him or her will have to be the second-handed smokers. Exposed in this condition for a long time, the innocent people will tend to be in poor health. Secondly, smoking in the public can also lead to many tragic accidents, such as conflagration. In 2002 of Xi'an, a large nightclub was on fire, heavy smoke constantly sent off from the building. The accident caused dozens of deaths, shocking people around the country. There are still many other tragedies caused by the small cigarette, and we don't want to see them happen again and again. After looking back on them, we can see the urgent to forbid smoking in the public, especially in places which can easily catch fire. But to be frankly, if too much pressure are put on the smokers, they would probably pour scorn on the ban. So, I think some cubs should be set especially for smokers, just like the divided smoking area and no-smoking area. Considering the foreseeable harms and hidden danger of smoking in the public, there is no time for the government to focus on this issue.",B1.1
"It is a hot topic for college students to argue whether it is important to have a part-time job. Different people have different view. Some students advocate the idea. For one reason as result, college students should responsible for ourselves, and part-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money, so that we can not to ask parents for our allowances. And it can also relief the pressure of parents. For another, through part-time job we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will good for us to prepare our future job. As the competition is fiercer in the social life, the more experience you have, the more chance you will have. However, the others are against the idea, they hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on study. It will spend much of our time and energy to do the part-time job. Because as part-time worker, our life and property security is not well protected by the law. For my own perspective, as we enter the university we have more free time, it is important for you to choose how to use of them. We should make the most of time and be the master of it. From my own experience, I am working in the restaurant in my free time, and I feel happy to have the job.",B1.1
" I don't agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in China. I'm not a smoker, and I don't like people smoking around me. But I still don't think it is not a good idea to completely forbid people smoking at the restaurants in China. On one hand, smoking is not forbidden by the whole society. All the countries have no such laws that completely forbidding smoking. Though nicotine makes people get addicted, making people die earlier. This is quite similar as drugs. The reason that tobacco has never been banned is that great amount of taxes are paid by the smokers and tobacco companies. This has been a important part of all the tax income to the governments. So rights are given to the people. Smoking is not about affecting people nearby, it's more like a right of freedom and fairness. Since governments never banned smoking, in my opinion, dividing guests into smoking area and non-smoking area at the restaurants would be a great idea for now. But I am looking forward to the day that all tobacco is forbidden all over the world, not only in Chinese restaurants.",B1.2
"What would college students do during long summer vacation? Some students stay at home watching TV shows and playing on-line games around the clock. Others go to cram school for reinforcement of their schoolwork. The others take part-time jobs. Some people might think that students who take part time job suffering from materialization. However, I think that taking part-time job can not only broaden our personal relationships but also let us get more society experience. In my college, there are even a lot of projects that we can take part time jobs in some famous company, such as TSMC and UMC. Students can learn some useful techniques and know more about what they might do and get if they want to work in those company. Moreover, by taking part time job, students earn their own money and learn to manage it by theirselves. Besides, they might cherish it because they get it by theirselves. I think that it's more effective to have good notions of money by actual experience than learning on textbooks. Although taking part time job is a good way of learning a lot of experiences and there are truly a lot of goodness. We should know the drawbacks of taking part time job at the same time. As a college student, learning is still our main work. We still have to use a lot of time on learning. After all, our future work depends mainly on what we learn at college. Having a good balance between part time job and schoolwork is very vital for all of us.",B1.1

"I agree with banning smoking at the restaurant in Japan completely. The most important reason, as you know, is that smoking is bad for health. Addition to the main cause of lung cancer, it causes other else kinds of cancer and lung and heart attacks. It is recently said that smoking might influence to baby's sudden death. A smoker at the restaurant, where various people including babies are, can be called as a murderer. Secondly there are people who feel bad when they smell tobacco's smoke. I work as a part timer at the Udon shop where isn't banned smoking. Some of customers smoke. Other customers often ask to me that they want to get the table as possible as away from smokers. And I myself also feel bad, cannot stop cough and disappear appetite. How to feel the smoke is different each other. I think shops must think of a person feel worst. When it comes to discuss about smoking, somebody absolutely says that people who smoke also have free of smoking. I think this is very fool. Do you have free of killing other people? Do you have free of infecting other people? Almost all human beings will answer NO. But to claim free of smoking is to answer YES to these questions. If owners of restaurant have common sense they must bun smoking completely.",B1.1
" I have saw some adults even teens smoking in public places more than once. Actually, I am very against such behavior. As for myself, the smelling of smog makes me feel awful. Besides, there are lots of reasons proving that smoking should be forbidden in public places. First, it is reported that if a smoker is smoking in a room, the health of other people who would breath in the poisonous smog around the smoker will be affected. Meanwhile, when people smoke in the public places, the air of the public places will be polluted. So it is no wonder that some public places have set the smoking room or smoking zone. Even so, smoking in public places shouldn't be promoted. Second, I believe that everyone might know that smoking is bad for our health, but why do so many people cannot stop smoking? Because smoking can addict people easily. Once you have a try, you cannot reject it. So the forbid of smoking in public places is of great importance in the term of the health of civilian people. Third, sometimes many dangerous accidents are caused by smoking. For example, when you are smoking in the gas station, the spark of cigarette may set fire to the gasoline escaping from the fuel tank, and cause big explosion. Considering from people's health or the security of society, the advantages of smoking in public places are much more than the disadvantages. We shall forbidden the smoking in public places for a better future.",B1.1
" I don't quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think. Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who don't smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money. As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we can't force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who don't smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. That's my opinion.",A2
"When students reach the tertiary level of their education, most people, especially the older generation, would expect them to be independent and more mature. It is often recognized as the time where the person finds his/her own self and takes responsibility for whatever step he/she takes in his/her journey in finding his/her own identity. Having a job at this early time somehow helps the students in their path to self-knowledge. Earning money through their own tears and hardship will open their eyes to their future life after school; the real life, as what they say. It helps them manage themselves properly and find their strengths and at the same time, their weaknesses. Having a job doesn't only mean that they gain profit, but rather, it also helps them gain knowledge. Also, it is a big help to their family who have supported their education for at least the past nine years of their life. It would be their way of uplifting the burden on the shoulders of the people who've helped them reach where they are now. It's good to know that even at this early time of their life, they are already taking responsibility of their actions. But still, they should still know to prioritize their studies even if they already have a job.",B1.2
"Our society has many smokers. So today recognition about smoking was as much higher than the past. For example, the police are recently cracking down a smoker in non-smoking areas in Seoul. Most of smokers are easy to feel cumbersome what obey the law. For this reason actually cause stress for the smoker but it can't be helped for their health. I don't smoke but I don't think that smokers are being a bad man. I think that smoking is means to relieve stress for smoker. But smoking can causes harm to someone else. That is typical example is secondhand smoking. Secondhand smoking is a big health hazard. For this reason, I'm sorry for smokers but I hope to keep smokers and passive smokers' body in good condition. But you don't push the smokers too much stop smoking. It may produce a negative effect to smokers. The best way is to motivate smokers to stop smoking. Then they will stop smoking themselves easily. I've had a similar experience, too. When I forced to stop smoking, my father who was smoker thought nitpicking. But when I encouraged my father to stop smoking, he showed a favorable attitude to me. In other words, smokers need motivation which stops smoking and encouragement.",B1.2
"Is it important for college students to have a part time job for Japanese college students? I agree with to have a part-time job. Firstly because, to experience job is also learning. Job is hard and different from school life. But you may be fun as you improve your skill. I think you can grow your mind this time. Part time job is very important. Secondly, today's economy has been worse. This influence our family's money. If you have considerate mind, you should think you earn money to lessen parents' worry about tuition fee. Almost all of my friends have part-time job in same reason. Thirdly, we are in university, so we need a lot of money to enjoy something; drink party, trip, hobby etc. One of my friends often tell me to lend him money. He has a part-time job, but as he spends all of his earning soon, he is always worried at the last of month. No one doesn't need money, so I think that to earn money is good.",B1.1
" In my opinion, whether college students have a part-time job is not important. Furthermore, I persist that college students should not find a part-time job. The reasons are listed as follow. Firstly, what we college students need to care is not about money but study. I recognize the famous saying from Hu Shi, the ex-headmaster of Pecking University, 'what our students in college should do is just to study'. That means college students' only mission is studying, so taking a part-time job will by no means affect the study. If college students have part-time jobs, they will have to reduce their time for study. Working several hours a day costs a lot of time and energy. As a result, the students will find it hard to adjust to the studying agenda, and finally, they will fall behind or fail in their studies. Secondly, many students hold the view that part-time job will enlarge their social experience and that will help them in future. But what would they really get from the part-time job? Things are not that easy for students, the effects of part-time job are usually beyond their expectation. Because part-time jobs are mostly made up of small employments like waiters in restaurants or tutors teaching English to younger students. These jobs may be suitable for a under graduate. But once the students graduate, they won't take these occupations. Therefore, students shouldn't waste their time on part-time jobs. At last, I again stress that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"I don't agree with this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because this statement is too severe to follow. In fact, it is clear that smoking is one of the most causes to lead to cancer. And smoking gives bad influence to not only their own but also around people. I think this is the worst point of smoking. And I need not ban smoking completely. I think that the restaurants should divide into smoking people and not smoking people. GREEN MOS BURGER is a good example. In there, smoking seats are placed outside the shop and non-smoking seats are placed inside the shop. This is very interesting. Few years ago, in there, smoking seats were placed inside the shop. This is cared about this problem. Now at the many restaurants, smoking seats and non-smoking seats are divided inside the shop. I am satisfied with this situation. But the restaurants that are banned smoking are increasing. So if I think about the matter in terms of management, it is good to build the restaurants for smoking people. These are the reasons why I don't agree the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"Since I am a smoker myself, naturally I don't agree. It would be discrimination, pure and simple in my opinion and would go against my civil rights. I am a considerate smoker and will quite often go outside my own house to have a smoke so that I don't bother any visitors who maybe non-smokers. Since I have been to quite a lot of restaurants in Japan, I see an awful lot of Japanese people smoking too. Sometimes the air is a bit stale and the place doesn't smell very nice at all. I think that is just because of really bad or useless ventilation and also because some restaurants are so tiny that when there are too many smokers, it gets pretty bad. Having said that, it is my choice to smoke and a non-smokers' choice not to. If they are uncomfortable in an establishment that allows smoking, then either leave or just don't go there in the first place. I don't believe that it would be right to ban smoking in a business that does not belong to the government. We can all decide for ourselves without the need for any laws telling us what we can and can't do.",C2
"Now, A part time of job is important for college students. Because we need it for benefit in our life. And then, every day we have some activity which don't important. Example: playing game, browsing, etc. Because of that we need a part time of job, we as college students must doing some usefully activity. Not only working but only get experience in our life. In Indonesia, many people don't have a job because they don't have experience in their job. So they don't accept in office. A part time is a way for us to have a job and benefit in our life. Every day, in home we always doing something that is don't important. We are lazy for doing something is important. A part time of job is solution for us to get experience. We need some job to get some money, to buy some life of material or others. Every day, we need food. And ours parent aren't always given money to us. Because of that we need a part time of job. A part time of job, it is important for college student to get experience in their life. So we need a part time of job",B1.1
"I disagree. The student assimilates knowledge rapidly. so It is imperative that students should put their hearts and soul into their studies Also, they need self-improvement. I disagree on college students to have a part - time job. A proper way is pay one's registration fee in installments or school expenses, educational expenses, tuition. So I think that most of students study hard more than have part time job. As mentioned above student is to recognize the talent and individuality of each student and to develop him finally it behooves students to study. Many University Students do part-time-job. They are juggling part-time jobs and hours of homework every night; sometimes they're so exhausted that they're nearly asleep in early-morning classes. Recently Part-time jobs, homework, school activities and friends often are prioritized higher than is sleep. Many Students working part-time to pay for his school expenses. Currently, the major issue among college students is tuition. Some students began protesting against tuition fee rise by refusing to attend classes in other University. Tuition has raised a lot. College tuitions hovered between 5 and percent. So we have to a part-time-job for student fees. Korea's University is going mad I think. Student's fee is very Expensive Just I think.",B1.1
"I do not think badly about smoking. But smoking in public places for people who do not Smoke and avoid smoking if you think that is different. For themselves as well as the stress that smoking can do What no one shall harm to others, but of course I'm sorry If you need to give me more days I should try to avoid Causing harm to another person, most people do not think It is smoking. Exactly call for smoking to be bad behavior, But while living in a society with the pursuit of his Interests are absolutely a problem with. In addition, Secondhand smoke is more harmful than smoking It through junior high school student knows that education Are too often the adults that they might not know it is not? A close friend or remotely close to knowing the person I met for the first time that a victim of secondhand smoke And nowadays there are many cases of women who smoke and smoking, But it is still more of a male. Slip on the idea that equality between Women and men, but men say nine human ancestors would have To protect women and children did not take even such a small Consideration does not make sense. Thus, smoking in public places Or not to smoke around people that do not harm the freedom Of the individual smoking in them, so do not think there is good reason to stop.",B1.2
"Part time job is actually a job which a person does in his extra time. It can be a tuition centre job or a call centre job or online jobs etc. Part time job become a trend in present age. mostly students attract toward it. Some people take it as a fun, some in order to get experience, some as a time pass and some in order to fulfill their needs and to support his family financially. Most of students belong to poor families and they are not able to fulfill their study expenses so they join part time job to fulfill their needs. Some students take it as a hobby they know about the value of time and instead of wasting their time, they join some job to get experience. Some people take it as a fun like online jobs. It helps people to fulfill their needs. Part time job encourage to enhance the professional attitude of a person. But some time students involved themselves that much in this job and leave the studies that is not good. If it is taken in positive way it is very helpful. If it is taken in negative way it can create great problems.",B1.2
"Lots of problems exist in part time job. I would like to discuss low wage, behavior of superior, and no break time during work. I have done part time job in Korea the time I was working these three problems caused me lots of stress when I was at work the manager treated me bad he swore at me and shouted at me in front of people, At the work break time was not guaranteed if the manager see me moving slowly he told me to walk faster or to run, of course the wage was not so good and I didn't get paid in proper date. Behavior of manager or superior at the work in work, I heard bad news more than good news. In my case as I said. Manager used to swore at part time job workers. This problem should be fixed as soon as possible because part time job workers has personality too they do not deserve that my onion is relationship between part time job worker and superior should be improved for good. The second problem is break time is not guaranteed. Human kind requires food, sleep, etc.. To live a keep up but at the part time job work employers want worker to work until shift is done that might increase the incest but that is the good way to lose people",B2
"Being a college student means you have to take some responsibilities. And most people consider it is necessary for college students to earn their school fees and ordinary life expanse. Therefore, many students in Taiwan have experiences of taking a part-time job. In my opinion, having a part-time job not only helps student earn some money but also teaches them how to prepare for their career in the future. It is important for college students to have a part-time job because it has many benefits. A college student is almost regarded as a grownup, so they should walk away from the shelters of their parents. Actually most western students think they must take care of themselves after graduating from high school. Because in some case, a person who reaches at the age of being a college student has already had the basic ability to live in the society on himself. Besides, only when working for the expenditure of living will understand we cherish any little amounts of money. Although it is important to have a part-time job, some people still think it could influence school performance even make student flunk their some subjects. It is undeniable that some students in Taiwan encounter those situations. But I still think a mature college student can handle their schoolwork and jobs simultaneously.",B1.1
"I think it is necessary for college students to have a part time job, because these kinds of experience give student to valuable moments which learn about many things. There are several reasons to support my idea. First of all, students learn the importance of money, and they take care of money far better than before. Because through doing part-time job, they learn that it is really hard for them to make money. So they learn the value of money which they have spent very uselessly. Secondly, part-time job would give students to diverse social experiences. They have to learn how to hang out their boss in the office, and how to treat their customers by doing part-time job. Thus, they finally learn the real world which is very different from the comfortable world in the school. These kinds of experiences are very useful for them to work at the office after graduating the college. In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that it is better for college students to have a part time job. Not only it can give students to realize the importance of the money, but also it can make students to experience real social world which is very different from the school word.",B2
"Smoking in restaurants is not possible. Restaurants are public places and places to eat myself to not harm the people you might want to come back with. While damage too many people eat rice and give discomfort to others in order to avoid damaging behavior should not smoke. Nonsmokers than smokers who smoke look more damage. All the buildings are now non-smoking restaurant in the building's smoking building, smoking will be positive. Actually, all the damage at the expense of more than one person to enjoy a delicious meal and a chat while eating should refrain from smoking. Create smoking areas for smokers for smokers, where are creating. Where all can dine in the Proficient smoking. Paying money to the rice while eating a hot dog eating discomfort in more comfortable and happy to eat the rice should be a smoking restaurant. Non smoker of many smokers of fewer smokers in order to yield a large number of meals can be happy and everyone should make a space. Number of all the happy meals at the expense of the environment better than if you are going to be. All meals come when you eat happily. Let us concede a little. Thank you",A2
"I disagree the view that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My evidences are below. That smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants does not fit with the reality world. Because a lot of men smoke now, which smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants is impossible at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men maybe against that smoking is completely banned in the restaurants. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. And those smokers will not go to restaurants will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problem. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harm for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for health of people's, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking help them many ways. Some say that they fell happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoking, for all the restaurants want to get more interests. I think maybe we can do other something to solve smoking problem in the restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now.",A2
"Nowadays, students in college have a lot of spare time in school. Some of them choose to take a part time job to spend their time. Also, there's another voice that against students taking part time jobs. Today, we'll talk about this. First, I'd like to say that I'm very interested in college students taking part time jobs. I'm a grade-one college student. Except going to classes, I have a lot of time in my dorm. When winter comes, I have to stay at my dorm, playing games with my roommates or surfing the Internet. Whenever I play the games, I always recall of my dad and mum's words telling my to work hard in college when I leave home, but my roommates are so passionate that I can't stop playing with them. How to solve the problem without hurting our relationship? I think to go out and take a part time job is a good idea, at least you're not wasting your valuable adolescence time. Taking part time job is to be great beneficial. One can gain experience while make money when taking part time job. The experience in working is very competitive when you graduate and find a real job. You're an grown-up if you're in the college, I think your parents will be glad if they know that you're making money in college, and taking part time job is an excellent chance! People often comment that the after-1990s generation a failure and disgusting in China. I think they are mainly referring to the naughty college students. Our college students really should do something to prove that we are better than they foresaw. If everybody tries to take a part time job, the society may change.",B1.1
"Without doubt, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Before college, we live at home and enjoyed parents' love and care. So when we first time have the chance to live alone outside, we must have to study how to take care ourselves and be a real person. I had a lot of part-time job experience, I used to worked at a restaurant, is really hard and tired. Every day as I finished my school class, I take bus to my work place. The restaurant is far from my school, so I usually review the school subject during the time. There were always lots of people come to my store and eat dinner, I needed to stand for a long time and walked over and over again around the restaurant, it is almost made me crazy. But the boss and the other people worked in the restaurant we really friendly and they treated me as if we were family. The customs also nice to me. Sometimes they even gave me some little gift. I was very appreciated about this job and the people who I met. I really learn lot from this job, but it is important that should not spent too much time at job, after all, we are still a student, we have to do what we should do. If we can make good use of our time, have a part-time job is a very good experience.",A2
"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job. There are several reasons. First, college students need some money, for example having lunch or eating dinner with friends. Although studying is the most important thing for college students, having a good time with friends is also important. Students enjoy playing with their friends everyday. Second, a part-time job brings up college students. By working, college students learn social skill, manner, and common sense. A few years later, all the students will be required such things. College students must practice by working as part-time worker. Third, a part-time job is the important chance to make friends. In fact, my coworkers and I are good friends. Talking with the seniors is very interesting. I enjoy part-time job with them. Fourth, college students should know the importance of the money. No man wastes the money that he earns. To learn the use of the money is very important. Thus, I think that college students should have a part-time job. A part-time job needs a lot of time, but that is never futile. There are some people who don't have a part-time job. If they start working, they surely grow up in various aspects.",B1.1
"Restaurants are public places for common people to come and enjoy themselves. But now a day it is becoming a source of content with much disease. E. g., restaurant infection, cancer & etc. These are many factors infecting but one of them which is playing an important role is Smokey atmosphere. The fumes from cigarette consist of many toxic component which causes many cancer gimmick diseases & as well as damages the fissures of brain. These flames spread all over the atmosphere and pollute the aria. Any person who come in contact with this atmosphere acquire the dangers of become ill. In this way the persons around the smokers are equally at risk to become ill. So smoking should be banned at restaurant & public places to avoid the damager of getting serious diseases of lungs as well as oesophagus. One of the most dangerous components of cigarette nicotine found in its smoke which destroy abilities of a person. In this way people particularly our new generation who frequently visit restaurants & public places found the damage of being ill. That's why smoking at restaurants should be banned.

"Part time job now plays an important part in college students' life. We can get not only some money but also much experience from part time jobs. So, most of us are willing to do a part time job though it takes much free time. Someone say that part time jobs may lead the college students to a wrong way. They will care too much about money or profits and forget the main task of their college life. Since the students come here to learn, they should concentrate on it. This kind of idea is mostly right. The main task of students is to learn and create. We'd better spend most of our time on it. But experience is good and it doesn't come from books but life. Long time in school makes us far from the society. In order to be more than a bookworm, we should go out from books and do some part time jobs to learn from life. I have to say that more and more students now don't know how to be with others. The main reason is that they hardly spent time with strangers. If they try some part time jobs, this problem will be solved easily.",B1.2
"I do agree to some extent if college students to have a part time job. I believe they may work part time if only they remember the following : First, if they can arrange the time between study and work. I see my own friends that almost all of them cannot arrange the time, so many tasks of the campus that are not resolved. Because, they spend more time to part their job and they often do not do school assignment. Second, they do not forget their obligations. Obligation at home and at campus. I see some of my friends who have a part time job is not present at campus, because their prefer their work. Because, their work cannot delayed and they think they get paid for the work. They know that they will not get paid if they do not do the job. Third, their part job do not bother their learning. Some of my friends who have a part time job complain that they feel tired and eventually they do not go to college or doing their tasks. Fourth, if they have a part time job that can develop their skills in particular related to the program that they took in college. They will more skill and a lot of experience. Some friends work but not related to their study. They only want the money.",B1.1
"Part time job is a job that student worked in a part of the day or week. Usually people who have part time job are the college students. It is important for college students to have a part time job. It becomes important because the students will get a lot of benefits. First of all, the students will get the experience beside studying. So, they do not only get the theory, but also they can practice or learn much experience by getting a part time job. Second, the students will get more money. Actually, the college students need a lot of money. So, if they have part time job, they can help their parents. Therefore, they can save it for their future or if their parents are rich, they can use the money to buy something that they want. Third, the students can study to get a job. When they graduate from the college, they will need to get a job. If they have part time job, they know how to get a job, so they will not have much difficulties. And the last but not least, the students can know how hard to look for money, so they will not eager to spend money quickly or extravagantly.",B1.1
"The college students have to study hard in the school. Have student to part time work? I think agree. Because I think to work can learned many thing, we can know how to learning to get along other people. We also learned more skill in the community. It is a way to learning other thing and we can know how to live in the world. We also can know my parents how to hard work for we. If you have a part time work. You can learn how to have duty heart and learn many things. We can to lighten our parents a burden. Parents should felt happy we can know to do for them. I think to do part time have two types. One part time is a fixed work. The other part time is a unfixed work. The unfixed work is like go everywhere to work. Maybe next time have not worked. If you think have work every day. You should find fixed part time work. Because if you only a student. You should unhandy to find all jobs. Because you have go to study in the school. So I think find part time is well for our.

"I don't think that it was important but I do think that it is important and necessary for all students to do so now, considering the financial mess that we are in. Thanks to the global recession, are lot of people around the world are in serious financial difficulty. In light of this fact, I think that it is necessary for students to get a part-time job so that they may contribute to the economy in some small way. Many students have to work anyway, because their financial situation dictates that they do so. For others, they may not need to work but by doing so, they can also assist with the global economic recovery in a meaningful way and that is of course, by earning and spending cash. We can all play our part in the financial recovery process and the students can also play their roles in the process too. It is necessary and I believe that it will help all of us and not just the college students in that we won't feel like there is nothing that we can do except sit around in some kind of helpless mode waiting for things to get better. The situation won't improve unless we, all of us do something to improve it without just relying on governments to get us out the mess we find ourselves in.",C2
"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of smokers in recent years. However, smoking is gradually being forbidden in more and more public places. Restaurants, under this circumstance, become most common places for smokers. Actually, some advanced restaurants have already taken measures to prevent people from smoking while having meals. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking does harm both to the smoker himself and people in the neighborhood. It is common sense that smoking is the cause of a series of severe diseases including the lung cancer. What's more, some people around the smoker may be allergic to the smog, which can lead to the unpredictable consequences. On the contrary, if a restaurant is free of the released smog, the air around will be clear enough to enable the people inside to refresh themselves. Furthermore, banning of smoking can largely decrease the possibility of fire. As is known to us all that the kitchen in a restaurant is full of lampblack in most times, which makes it easier to catch fire than in other places. So no smoking means that the security of the people in the restaurant will be better assured. Last but not least, if only some restaurants prohibit smoking while others don't, a phenomenon will emerge that a number of smoker will chooses to eat in a small restaurant where smoking is allowed. This will cause the increasingly worse of the environment in those small restaurants. To conclude, smoking has a bad effect not only on people's health, but also on the environment. Therefore, I hold the opinion that at all restaurants, smoking should be completely banned.",B1.2
"Nowadays smoking is one of the most problems in the social because of the increasing of the smoker even though they have campaigns about stop smoking but it does not accomplish much. From the research some of the smokers think that smoking is good for their mild such as decreased themselves or their look to be more cool. Actually smoking affects many bad things. The smoking is incredibly bad for your health and for people who smell the smoke. I think smoke is really bad for example health of the smokers that will look worse and worse, surround people because the smoke from there will cause other people health to become like the smoker himself, for environment that cause air pollution and the lost is waste your money. Many people spend too much money on cigarettes. I saw many of smokers order sweet cigarettes from other countries. It's very worthless for daily life. From the most of people think that smoker is really bad even though smoker think that it good for them more or less. They won't see any disadvantages since they are still strong. If someday they become sick because of cancer, they will regret about that. So we have to think of the way to help them stop or lessen the smoking habit for decreasing the smoker.",B1.2
"Smoking is a big curse that converts a health man into thin and fragile one. The habitual of smoking are just looking a hollow man. In mostly cases, they are lazy and intoxicated and can not perform their work with great efficiency. The people belonging to this class are mostly teen agars. Medical researches had proved that smoking causes many diseases in human being. A few of them are lungs, cancer, asthma, buckle cancer and Other breathing diseases Medical research had also shown that a man living in smoky atmosphere, has same effects as a man who is smoking. so, we should avoid from sitting near smokers. As far as restaurant is concerned, it is a gathering place. There is a rush of people. So, smoking at that place can affect all other near by persons. So smoking should be bound in restaurants and all other gathering places. Free use of smoking products should be bound. The smoking of one person at gathering place, irritates all other persons, present at that place to irritate others is morally wrong. We should aware other people to avoid smoking and such a kind of other habits. If our children and younger are award, in this way, the future of our nation will be in secure hands. May Allah bless wisdom to our nation, so that, they will abstain from smoking (Ameen).",B1.1
"My opinion the part time job has advantage and disadvantage. Because the part time job makes students have a short time to prepare education or reading books for exam. The part time job makes students have low or drop grade because they use almost time to their part time job. That is disadvantage about part time job in my opinion but the most important thing is allocate time of mine. But part time job makes student have more money and then they can use it to buy stationary or buy everything that they want. When they get money by part time job they should use it for family. Those are all advantage and disadvantage about part time job in my opinion. Having considered in detail, I still hold on my position that teenagers essentially need to work at least one job when they are student in schools to receive several benefit from it. So, I predict that schools and parents will support our young person to work a part time job. We have to ask ourselves, who can deny the importance of working of teenagers or we can ask ourselves should we do our best in our study? All people got their own reasons and they choose their own paths for going.",B1.1
"I do not think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is generally believed that smoking does a great harm to our health. So it is really a very good choice if it is banned in most parts of the restaurant. But I also do believe that since it is really hard to get rid of smoking, we should at least show a little respect to the smokers and allow them to smoke in certain parts of the restaurants. Maybe we could find a small room as a specific smoking room and allow them to have a smoke there. Anyway, they are not having drugs. Although it does harm to others, we can not deprive them form their fundamental human rights. Simply find a little space for them and all the problems could be solved. Another problem is the possibility of putting a ban on smoking everywhere. On the one hand, with millions of people now smoking in China, it could be a difficult goal to achieve. We can not put a cop in every restaurant. On the other hand, it has no real meaning if we could really achieve this goal. Although people no longer smoke in the restaurant, can we guarantee that they would not pick up a cigarette again on the street or in their own homes. These behaviors could also do harm to people's health. However, we couldn't have an eye on them under these circumstances. So, generally speaking, I don't think that it is a good idea to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants. What we should do is to uses some other measures to tell people that smoking harms. These measures could only work when people get to know the harm and are willing to stop smoking by themselves.",B1.2
"When I was young, I was told by my teacher that for a student, it's more important to learn study-ability than learning knowledge. However, my teacher never pointed out the way of learning study-ability, he only teach us how to win the knowledge competition as other teachers, even he knew the importance of the study-ability. I think Chinese students were just like eggs lived in a tremendous protection system before they stepped into university. College students were better, they were more independent, analytical and original, but still were newborn chicken with a piece eggshell. This was a result of many factors, but that's not my focal point, I wanted to focus on how to help college students get rid of the last eggshell. Actually, the answer always was not unique, hundreds people had thousands ways to make them more mature. For most college students, having a part time job was a wise and effective way to get rid of the last eggshell, to make up the defect of growing up by the over protection system. Having a part time job gave you incentive of working hard because you earned from it ; Having a part time job enriched your college life ; Having a part time job made you more sociable and learned more life experience from it...... Actually I can list a lot of benefits of having a part time job for a college student. But we should notice clearly that the central theme was not how much money you earned, how many friends you made, was the ability you learned from the part-time job, was the ability of studying, was the ability of independence, that's the most important!",B1.1
"In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because of following reasons. First, it is quite annoying to have disgusting smell caused by cigarettes when eating and it may as a result of destroying customers' appetite and feelings when eating out. Besides, food in restaurants may be covered by dangerous smoke and may not be clean any more when there is someone smoking there. In addition, it is not respectful to those who don't smoke but under attack by second-hand smoke, which may do harm to their health and cause big problems to them. Last but not the least, no matter you smoke or not, it is extremely harmful to human beings when smell the smoke created by cigarettes and eat unclean food which was covered by the smoke, and it has unexpected effects on our health like cancer, high blood pressure, and other diseases. As a result, based on those reasons and disadvantages when being exposed of the smoke created by cigarette, I strongly recommend that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is even better that smoking should be completely banned in all the places in the country.",B2
"There are a lot of smoke-free areas at restaurants, cafes, movie theatre, and pubs in many countries. Some countries hold that smoking in public places should be forbidden by law for people's health, while others insist that people have the rights to smoke even in public places in terms of freedom, economic effects, and overestimated data. However, smoking should be banned in public places all over the world since passive smoking could cause serious health problems and the policy prohibiting smoking in public places could help smokers reduce or quit smoking, enhance performance in workplaces and be helpful in terms of economic effects and the people's rights. Second hand smoke in public places could harm people's health. It could have been associated with a lot of diseases such as bronchitis, asthma, lung cancer and heart disease. Especially, passive smoking is dangerous for pregnant women, fetuses and children. According to an article, second hand smoke can reduce the chances of getting pregnant and increase the risk of pregnancy complications. In addition, second hand smoke can cause miscarriage. All in all, although some countries allow smokers to smoke in public places in terms of freedom, economic effects, and overestimated data, smoking should be prohibited in public places all over the world. That is because second hand smoke could cause a lot of dangerous diseases, and the no-smoking policy in public places could give smokers a motivation to reduce or quit smoking, increase performance in workplaces, and be efficient in terms of the people's rights and economic effects. These merits make more countries try to forbid smoking in public places.",B1.2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, most students have part-time job in order to pay something, such as eat, transportation and so on. On the other hands, foreign books are very expensive. It costs about NT 1000. So far, I have part-time job. I think I had learned a lot from the part-time job. For instance, I improve my communication skill and get more self-confident. In 2009, every countries had faced economic recession, many people lost job. Maybe family faced that difficult problem. Due to deal with the problem, students have to get a par-time job. The situation is very common in global economic recession. If students have a part-time job, it can decrease parent's hard things. Everyone knows high education is most expensive. Having a part-time job reduces parent's burden and increase experience. Finally, I agree with having a part-time job in college. It is not only to earn money but also to learn a lot. We can make a lot of friends in different field. Getting a part-time job has a lot advantages if you deal with time management. If you are good at time management, having a part-time job is a good choice in college.",A2
"I don't agree with forbidding smoking. Though I am not a smoker or a shopaholic, I think we should think about those who like to smoke. As we know that cigarettes are harmful to our health, the surfaces of all the cigarettes mark the damage of smoking. Those who still want to buy have revealed us their decision so that we should take respect to them. We cam see many place have smoking area or outside room for them. What will it be when we bind the smoker smoking in the restaurants? They might share their smoke outside the door or worse, in their house. If they had children, then the seeds of lung cancer might root in the babies' body, and also, including their mom. If you think smoke in the outdoor will be better, then you are wrong. The smoke still exist and will spread widely. To combine people smoke indoor looks good to the 'don't smoke' people, actually, we need to think more carefully. Maybe the answer is defiantly opposite. If the restaurant have the area for smoker only, the don't smoker will not be there then they will not have the doubt of being to the second-smokers. It's no need for us to having a law to them. The smoker won't decrease; the second-smoking won't ease. We need to find a better way to balance the right of the smoker, no smoker. I believe there still have many ways that can solve this problem and it's better than just forbid their freedom of motive.",B1.2
"Smoking at public zones not yet become a big issue. But now these topic is become a big issue related to human right. People believe that smoking at public zones such as at restaurants can disturb other unsmoker people to become passive smoker. They believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Many reasons are considerate for smoking banned at all the restaurants in the country and public zones in general. First reason is human right. People believe that smoking at public zones is include in human right problem. Smoking at public zones can disturb unsmoker people to become passive smoker that very dangerous in health. There are facts that passive smoker is more dangerous than active smoker. So that people believe that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants and other public zones in the country. Other reasons is health problem. As explained before, passive smoker is more danger than active smoker. It because danger materials which inhaled by passive smoker is more complex. So that passive smoker get more health risk. It make sure that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In conclusion, with several reasons, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants and other public zones in the country. Government should make the law related to the problem.",B1.2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because do part-time job can make college students get more knowledge of the live. If students have no job experience they must meet something risks. For example: In society they cannot have enough experience to find normal job. This is why parents ask their son to find part job to get some job experience Second when we get some part-job, we can meet different someone else. I think if we meet more people that we can learn more things. This thing maybe bad news but can let us learn experience to avoid that. Like my experience. I worked in the elementary school. I must take care of students in their class. In the fact this work is so hard because this students too difficult to control They make me so tired, but I think the experience can make me faced difficult things can get enough braves. The experience is very important than any else. Although part-time job maybe difficult for students but if we can make money by this part-time job and use this part-time to learn more knowledge and more friends we can feel happy. Part time job is Very important for me",B1.1
"Smoking is very harmful for human beings, it is very much dangerous for the lungs, The people who, could continuously use for some kind of smoking, their lungs have complete destroy. Most of people in our society come in restaurants and they are smoking for a long time there. Mostly we can see these kinds of smokers, sitting in the public restaurants like coffee, tea and fast foods restaurants. You can also see the large number of smokers, they comes in such kind of restaurants they must be disturb who peoples, sitting behind them. The peoples couldn't say stop smoking sitting around them, but they must be irritated with the smokers. The manager and staff of these places are disturbing the smokers. But couldn't warn them because smokers are also their customers. The whole environment should be disturb, now these days the trend of sheesha will be rise, and also available in many restaurants. In research of magazine and TV, the one sip of sheesha equals by 3 cigarettes. Sheesha will be causes of through and lungs infections, but we can say very sadly, large numbers of boys are using these bad thing. And some rich families are also using it for enjoyment. Our government should be action, on the smokers who smoking in the restaurant, because only our government is strictly banded on the smokers. Also stuff of restaurants will be try to the decreasing of restaurants sitting smoking, and give tough time those restaurants which available sheesha and other kind of addictions.",B1.1
"I agree. I realize that a lot of people will disagree with me, but I feel that students who have part-time jobs usually work better with their degree studies. Perhaps it is because they are normally more organized than some of their mates or they have just gotten into sound routines when it comes to balancing work with study. Some just couldn't be bothered working anyway, because they just want to cruise through their degrees and have parties every day. Nothing wrong with that, if they pass, but I think the ones that I have seen who are also working, seem to take their studies more seriously and dread the thought that they might even fail one subject. I am not saying that this is true for all students, it is just my opinion based on the comparisons that I have made between different categories of students who I happen to know personally. Another thing that struck me was that there course averages seemed to be slightly higher not for any one particular subject but generally speaking over the course of their degrees. I also think that for a lot of students these days, they understand what is happening in the world, the economy, the job market and they know that if the want to get anywhere in life, they are going to have to work for it.",C2
"I agree that restaurants have to make a place without smoke. We all know smoking is bad for our body, but actually, people who smell second-hand smoking will get hurt worse. Restaurants are public area, we have to care about most people's health instead of insisting few people's right. I think that people can go outside smoking to prevent other people breathing their smoke if they really want to smoke. For example, in the university campus, there are many area set for smoker. I think it is a good way to take a balance between smokers and other people. In the respect to restaurants, obviously, the restaurant owners want more and more customers coming. However, if the owner want more customers, making a clean and comfortable restaurant environment is important. In other to care most customers' need, I think no smoking in the restaurant is necessary. Smoking or not depends on people themselves, however, people can not decide smelling second-hand smoke by self in the certain place or situation. Therefore, for our health, making place without smoke is everyone's responsibility. Although people have smoking right, in the contrast, people also have right that not to smell smoke. Therefore, I think no smoking restaurant is better.",B1.1
"Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs, which is criticised by many people for affecting academic study to some degree. Despite the disadvantage, I still hold the view that college students benefit a lot more from this experience. To begin with, taking a part-job helps college students make their first step into the real society. Every one ought to work for the society sooner or later. Early education equips us with primary knowledge while colleges act as a transition period, transforming us from students to social individuals. It's an appropriate and efficient way to aware us of the society and realize the transition. Besides, getting a job early helps us find what we really like. Look at Dell, one of the most successful businessmen in the world. He took up fixing computers during college, resulting in his leaving school and starting his own career. Jobs are what we are going to devote our whole lifetime to. Therefore, we should get prepared so as to choose one we are crazy about. In addition, working experience during college time adds to the possibility of being successfully signed by a prominent corporation. Take my sister as an example. With ample working experience in college, she was picked out from a pile of talented employees. When competing on the fierce employment battle, part-time job experience is a powerful weapon. Opponents say that having a part-time job may have a bad impact on one's academic grades. However, grade is not the single standard by which a person should be judged. It is the all-round quality that really counts. To conclude, I stand at the back of getting a part-time job during college. It is interesting, beneficial and worthwhile.",B1.1
"Restaurant is a airtight place. It is hard to make the air circulate. If someone smokes in the restaurant, it would make the air worst. Besides, it is reported that the health of people who smoke the second-hand smoke is much worst than the one smoking. The ingredients in the tobacco could make our respiratory system and nervous system operate slowly. Even they might be damaged because of a long time of smoking. Restaurant is a public place. The people who would come to restaurant look for a clean and comfortable place to have a meal. Even many parents would bring their children to restaurant. At that time, someone smokes in the restaurant; the people in the same place would smoke the smell. People eat the meal and smell the smoke. The feeling would not be good and feel depressed. And people have the right which refuses to smoke second-hand smoke. It is nonsense that because of the right of a few people, sacrificing the right of most people. In order to avoid this circumstance, the government has set the law about smoking in the public places. However, no all of restaurant follow this law. In order to give everyone a good eating place, smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. Everyone in the country and the government should make a big effort to achieve this goal.",B1.1
"I absolutely agree that Smoking should be completely banned at all the food restaurants in the country. Because restaurant always must be clean. When I was young, I went to Gal-bi restaurant with my family. My father and my brother, of course, smoke, but him never smoking at restaurant. So I always ate food at restaurant. But, that day a man was smoking at restaurant!! In restaurant! I was eating Gal-bi, I caught because his smoking. I really loved Gal-bi but the smoking smell made me angry. So I had no appetite. I keep engaging him but he didn't know that what he faulted. These days, almost restaurant regard cleanliness. Even coffee shops. But a few restaurants in far country didn't regard cleanliness. I feel a little dusty and uncomfortable. Because I came my childhood's nightmare. I really want they stop smoking. I want to live cleaner world. I want to eat cleaner restaurant. Smoking is so scare disease like a drug. Smoking offers lung cancer and laryngitis and many various bad diseases. The lung cancer leads to the death. Didn't be a clean world? The world and all restaurants must be clean! So smoker try to quire the smoking now.",B1.1
" As far as I'm concerned, part-time job is necessary for college students at present. Because taking a part-time job dose have many advantages. Here are some of them. First of all, college students themselves have the required skills. Compared to senior high school students, college students have much more leisure time and they are older so that they can take good care of themselves. They can do whatever they want to do without the permission of parents and teachers. So they have the time and ability to take a part-time job. Besides, as a college students, we should learn to be independent from our parents. We can make some money by taking a part-time job. At the same time, it can provide us with some experience which is necessary in our life. It can also be fun and interesting. Last but not least, when we take a part-time job, we will meet many people who take varieties of jobs. Dealing with these people can improve our communicate skills and lay a basic foundation for our future career. Of course, whether taking a part-time job is up to you. If you are busy with study, you don't need to take it. but if you have the time and urge and the will to challenge yourselves, you'd better have a try.",A2
"I agree with this statement, part-time job are important for college students because college students should making some money for their living cost by themselves, beside their parents keep helping for finance. At least we can help our parents with having a part - time job. On the other hand we can practice our skills too before we really do a job after we graduate. So we knew how the fields are and how far our skill does. Part-time job. Sometimes some parents do not want their children do a job, because they do n ot want their children suffer. For some reasons too parents do not want their children work. Far beyond parents thought, we as a college students need some extra money for our living cost for hang out with friends, for daily needs and for some entertainments. I have some experience having a part - time job, I work for my grandma's restaurant at Bali selling fried chicken, that is a lot of fun. I have paid too even that's my grandma's restaurant. They appreciate what I have done. I am at cashier counting some money and receive customer's order then give it to the kitchen. I thought that would be difficult, but it doesn't, it is fun. Having a part - time job for college students are so important, that because many of college students do that, just to fill their boring day at campus and it can make money of it, that is a lot of profit.",B1.2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job for many reasons. First of all, they need to start their own economy life and having a part-time job is the best way for them to learn the real economy. They can experience the toughness of earning money and learn the value of money. In addition, they can exercise how to plan for using money constructively. Secondly, having a part-time job can teach them to be independent. Until graduating high school, most of the students depend on their parents, especially at economical points. However, they are now all grown-ups and they need to prepare for their own life. Therefore, it will be a beneficiary experience for them. Lastly, being a employee will teach them about the responsibility. Having a job means a contract between a employer and oneself, so it'll give them a duty to do their work properly. Some people would against this idea, because there is possibility of neglecting one's schoolwork. However, I've said above, having a part-time job will promote one's responsibility and independency; therefore, it will also give a good effect on the studying. In addition, they can learn how to plan their limited time properly. Because of heavy schedule, they won't waste their time. Moreover, spending lots of time in front of the desk doesn't equal to having a good grade. They can learn more precious values through this experience and they will grow to be fit people for the society.",B2
"The case of smoking is become a big conversation among people in the world, include Indonesia. In this case of should government ban smoking in restaurant?, Indonesia create an extreme debut actually smoking can be a great problem and also can be a great luck. Just think about both of these controversial there are many people that agree with the banning of smoking in certain place like in this case restaurant and there are also many people disagree about it of course it because of the advantages and disadvantages of smoking. Can said that government shouldn't ban smoker to smoke in restaurants because it will decrease the money income. This statement is excellent but think about it first, actually government has banned smoking in several places such as public transportation, public places, place for kids, place for prayer and restaurant are belong to public place means that people can not smoke in these places and the logic thinking that we can use is if the government ban the smoking in these certain places so that the government has thought deeply about the cause and effect of smoking it self. it also mean that smoker still can smoke except in these four place include restaurants. By banning smoking in restaurants government carry away human right, there must be many smokers lovers want to smoke in every places they stand of course in restaurant but in other head think about smoking unlover, they are furthermore for restaurant that use AC the smoke of cigarette cannot regulate well and it really disturb and sometimes make a dangerous effect.",B1.1
"I agree with the fact that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country First, smoke makes even delicious food bad and the air unclean. Some people enjoy eating special dinner and phenomenon of restaurants. Restaurants are not private place, but public place. Second, today, a lot of restaurants in Japan are separating a non-smoking seat and a smoking seat. But, in fact, that is not perfect. Smoke moves from a smoking seat to a non- smoking seat. Some restautant's owners may make much effort to do that, but it costs a lot of money to rebuild their restaurants. So it is difficult for owners to solve the problem of separation of smoking and non-smoking. Most importantly, some researches said that those who smoke are more likely to get cancer. In Japan, smoking is the second biggest factor of cabcer. And smoking results in the fact that not only peole who smoke but also people who are near smokers are badly affected. On the top of that, smoke has a more terrible effect on non-smokers than smokers. Smokers should have a responsibility for smoking and think about the importance of life. Therefore, I think that the Japanese Government have to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking does more harm than good.",B1.1
"I agree with the opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because there are a lot of nonsmoking people who hate the smoke. I think it is important for Japanese people not to smoke too much. In Europe, people are accepting the trend of nonsmoking in public facilities. Japanese people should be more active to reduce the number of victims of lung cancer that is caused smoking too. In order to make the smoker give up smoking, the government should put more tax on tobacco, and the company which produces tobacco should withdraw from the business of tobacco. If the government put more tax on tobacco, the income will increase and the financial condition of the Japanese government will improve. As for the production of tobacco, in fact, JT, which is the only tobacco producing company in Japan has started withdrawing from the tobacco business. I think that the worldwide tobacco boom has ended. So, the day will soon come when smokers are avoided not only in the restaurant but also in everywhere. If they ban smoking at a restaurant, the number of customers may decrease. But if they ban smoking at all the restaurants, the smokers may give up smoking at restaurant and go to restaurant without smoking.",A2
"I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job because money is very important and we are life very funny. There must be money to live a rich life. Hang out with friends, you need to get that money also can live and travel food. College students eat a lot to drink so money is a very important resource. If the parents and help you at work part-time and extra money Proficient leisure life. If part-time job to earn money and have a good experience. Through experience can be helpful in social life. Filial to their parents for earning money and making money as they could survive the book. And the savings are able to help in the future when he was home.

"Part time job is a job that needs fewer hours that full time job. Part time job can be seasonal or not. Some company hire more people in holiday to make sure the customer can be served. Like in Christmas, Independence day, etc. We can choose one from many kind of part time job. We can be a waiter, an assistant, baby sitter or even a teacher. College student usually get a part time job. It is very important and useful. College students can have a part time job, because they have flexible time from the university. So, they can match their time to go to college and another time to have part time job. Part time job is very useful for them. The first reason is the college student can spend their time to do something important. The second, part time job can make some many. So college student can have extra money for their needs like buy some clothes, pay car rental, buy some food, etc. The third is the college student can be more independent from their parent. The fourth is the college student can respect their things. They can use their money wisely because with working, they know that money is so hard to get. And the last is they will get more new experience.",B1.2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are many reasons why. I'll give three. Firstly, the experience gained from working to earn money and learning to manage the money one has made is a lesson that will last a lifetime. Even if their parents are helping with the tuition and they are only working to make their own spending money, they will learn to use their money more wisely since they had to spend time and effort to receive the money they are using. Students that are taken care of by their parents too much may lead to unmotivated workers that quit easily. There is no sadder story than that of a student that has finished 16 years of education without ever working a day in their life, only to run back home to their parents and live at home after college because of difficulties on their first job. Secondly, working part time may lead a student to finding skills they are good at but had never used before. A part time job may lead to a change in their major or it may change the student's idea of what they want to do for the rest of their life. A part time job can challenge a student to do something that they would not have tried just taking classes on campus. Finally, the people skills developed will help in any job, especially dealing with a boss and coworkers. Those people skills may also be good references or contacts for future work.",C2
"I agree that college students have a part time job. There are some reasons. First, students who have a part time job can help support a family. These days the college tuition fees and food expenses are growing. Parents' worries and sigh are also growing. If students have a part time job and earn their pocket money, they could aid family finances. Next, It can help increase experiences and careers to work part time job. Most people get a job after they graduated from the school. If we have a experience about part time job, when we get a job we can easily adapt ourselves to place of work. Finally, we can know the value of money. Give an example. I receive allowance from my parents. Because they give me pocket money on a weekly basis, I don't feel well the shortage of money. So I tend to spend all money if money exists. Therefore, college students who get a allowance lavish their money on everything since they don't make money. But, college students who have a part time job know the value of money and use money frugally. Like this there are many adventages of part time job. Although side effects of it exist, I hope that students wii be independent through working a part time job.",B2
"I don't agree with smoking. Smoking is not good for ourselves, but in Taiwan, many people smokes, even my fother. I remember when I was a child, I always forbided my fother smoked in our house, but it didn't work. My fother somked outside. I was disappointed, but I didn't give up. When I saw my fother smoking, I removed his smoke. After thousand times, I quite. My mother also told my fother not smoking or his health would be in danger, but it didn't work. I also saw my classmates smoking around my school when I was a junior high school student. My teacher punish them, but they still smoked. It was terrible then. After I went to senior high school, we changed our place to live, far from my father's factory, so that I won't smell so much smokes. I also had good grades at our new house, not only on my study but also on my piano. Maybe I would get a friend who likes smoking, but I would tell she not to smoke when she met me or dated me. I even got my best friend who smoking, but I don't care. I always told them that smoking was not a good hobby, some people would listen to me and quite smoking. I was so happy to hear that because I would think of helping a person to solve his life! Smoking is not good at our health, try our best to go away smoking places and don't touch any smoke.",B1.1
"Yes, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. To frequent smokers or addicts, they could see this as an unreasonable demand given all the other restrictions that have already been placed on them. However, to ban smoking at all restaurants would bring greater benefits to the community and society as a whole and hence, it should be implemented. Smoking has negative effects on one's health as well as those who breathe in their second-hand smoke. Statistics have shown that smoking is one of the main reasons for the high level of lung cancer. However, rather than for personal health, banning smoking from all restaurants would be for the benefit of the majority who would have to breathe in second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke has been shown to be more harmful than smoking itself. As such, banning smoking at all restaurants would actually bring about more health benefits to the society as a whole and also bring down the possibility of people getting lung cancer. In addition, it is necessary that smoking be banned in restaurants, especially those that are often patronised by families. It is to set a good example to young children and teenagers that smoking should not be allowed. It is an unhealthy act that not only harms one's health but also the environment that we live in. Last, it reduces the risk of having a fire. If the cigarette is not put out, it could actually leave behind a risk for a possible fire to start as a restaurant would have all the gas cylinders as well as furniture that could catch fire easily.

"Smoking has become very common and fashionable, especially among young boys. This habit usually begins at school when boys try to experiment with every new thing that they can lay their hands on. Despite the warnings given by doctors about the ill-effects of smoking, people continue to smoke. Smokers are addicted to it, and even if they want to, they cannot refrain from picking up a cigar or cigarette and puffing away. Some youngsters smoke for the sake of society and some feel that would make them appear liberated and broadminded. In the beginning, a teenager may take a few puffs from his friend's cigarette; then comes a time when it becomes an indispensable part of his life. Several puffs lead to the formation of a habit. Soon smoking begins to affect the health of the smoker. He becomes a chain-smoker. This smoke is toxic and the nicotine in the cigarette is known to cause cancer. It is ironic that despite the fact that every smoker is aware of the ill effects of smoking, he does not give it up. Tobacco companies are doing very well all over the world. Every packet of cigars or cigarettes has a warning inscribed in it: cigarette smoking is injurious to health. "" Yet the smoker never reads this warning and even if he reads it he never pays heed to it.",B1.2
"In my opinion, the importance of having part-time job varies among individual college students. However, I believe that most college students have a part-time job is because to earn extra money. It can be extra money for leisure purpose or it can be money to pay school tuition fees. My reason of having a part-time job is as the reason that I mentioned earlier. Hence, I agree that having a part time job is important. Having a part time job will definitely help to shoulder some of the debt responsibility that a college student has to bear after he or she graduates. Having in mind of the future monetary liability that one may have, makes a part time job important. Besides for the reason of earning extra money, I think that the part-time provides each individual a unique experience. It prepares one in some way or another in advancing into the work life when one graduates. It can be the social skill that one learnt in his or her part-time job or the social circle that one manages to create. They are all important skills and experience in life. Furthermore, a part-time job does not hold much risk that one has to face as compared to a real job. This shows the importance for college students to have a part-time job. ",B1.2
"Imagine that you are having a romantic dinner with your spouse, at a restaurant with nice ambience and the tempting aroma of food, when all of a sudden you smell a whiff of pungent cigarette smoke from the table next to you. Will that affect your enjoyment of your dinner? For me, it most definitely will, and thus I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants, for two main reasons. Firstly, second-hand cigarette smoke has been found to be extremely harmful, even more harmful to innocent passers-by than the smokers themselves. This means that smokers are actually bringing harm upon others when the smoke they exhale gets inhaled by the people around them. Will you want to enter a restaurant where you cannot breathe without inhaling all the poisonous fumes from other patrons' smoking? Most likely not, and therefore for the sake of their customers, restaurants should prohibit smoking within their premises. Secondly, smoking does not fit in well with the ambience that restaurants aim to provide their patrons. What we associate with smoking is the image of a slightly unkempt person in shorts and slippers and horrible-smelling breath, in other words, highly unappealing. On the other hand, restaurants are portrayed as high-class with delicious food. Thus, for the sake of their business, smoking should be banned so as to preserve their image. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants as it will benefit both the restaurant and the patrons ",B2
"I don't suppose that it's a wise idea to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. But I'm in favor of banning smoking at some restaurants. On one hand. It's of great significance of banning smoking. Firstly, as we all know, smoking for a long time will change people's health; it might lead to lung cancer and other diseases. Secondly, you may feel annoyed when people surrounding are smoking and forcing you to take in the polluted air, it harms you too. Thirdly, I suppose that restaurant is place where the beauty of wonderful food culture can be showed rather than the place to show the unhealthy habits of human beings, also, the smoke of cigarettes may lead to the decline of our appetite. At last, smoking may also cause accidents, for example, a small cigarette may lead to a fire accident if meet the sofa, carpet. On the other hand, I am opposed to ban the smoking at all restaurants. The most significant reason is that the smokers also have their own right to make a choice, it's not that considerable of us to take their right away from them. Then, it's known to us that smoking is a culture of human society, usually, good cigarette or cigar can show one's taste for life and make a businessman distinctive. Smoking at table can also be one of reasons linking to their success of enterprise, especially in China. In fact, we can take other measures to create good environment in the restaurants, for an instance, draw a line between no-smoking area and smoking area. To conclude, smoking has its bad effects, it disgusts others when damages smokers themselves' health, but we are supposed to take some more effective and humanity measures instead of ignoring the rights of smokers.",B1.1
"Smoking is something that teenagers today are popular smoking same fashion without knowing the penalty for smoking tobacco. Smoking is addictive substance that is harmful to the body. Smoking is not just physical abuse male smoking itself only to hurt people around you and the environment as well I think smoking in restaurants is not appropriate because the department is most people come to eat and maybe have children to eat by smoking is not suitable to smoke in restaurants because it is a danger to people nearby. They like to smoke but other don't so don't hurt people who want to eat by having smoking inside the restaurants. The servers should tell them to stop because they hold the right to tell customers in the restaurants not the customers. If the servers cannot handle it they should tell the managers or the owners to get rid of that person. I mean to take them out the restaurants but before that they must try to talk with the smokers nicely. If the smokers still acting rude to them. I think the guard should throw them out of the restaurants and ban them to come back again ever. Thus, smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants.",A2
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I'm strongly agreeing with this topic because smoking is bad for our life and another life too. If we are smoking it, others people will receive our smoke and when them are breathing in, they will have the poison in their body even though they are not smoking person. Smoking is making us dead as fast as possible especially the person who smokes it very much per day. Cigarettes are very easy to buy. We will see it in the shopping center or mini mart, so once of the reason that the most teenagers are smoking it because it is selling in everywhere, easy to find, and easy to buy too. In the restaurant, they must banned the smoking person and forbidden about smoking since the smoke will bother another people. I think smoke have a bad smell and it is bad with my body, therefore I never touch it and never try it. I always tell my friends too. I think the government must have the rule and should strict with that rule too. More over forbidden smoking in the restaurants is not enough for i think in the school and in the university should have this rule too for making the clean and fresh air space.",B1.1
"As we know smoking is an unhealthy habit. It is not only bad for the smokers but for the people around. While smokers are enjoying smoking people around may feel uncomfortable or disgusted, especially when they are all in a restaurant to have a sweet meat. Air with tobacco will ruin the appetite. So smoking in restaurants absolutely should be banned. Now in some restaurants, they still have some places for smokers to ""relax. "" Though both smokers and the managers of restaurants think setting a little place is a good way to solve the problems of smoking. But people still can smell tobacco even it is just a little. Smokers can't clean the air which is filled with nicotine right after they stop smoking. So the best way to solve the problem of nicotine is prohibited people smoking in restaurants and public places. Smoking in restaurants will also cause smokers to have bad breath. So they can't know how delicious the plats are. What they are eating is just nicotine, nicotine, and nicotine. In order not to ruin the atmosphere of testing food, I can't agree more that smoking in restaurants should be banned.",B1.1
"About college students to have a part-time job. I think that there is no absolute answer. I agree with the students working but would like to know how to protect themselves. Advantages and disadvantages of working with college students. If you can earn money, you can buy things you need, pay your bills, have a place to live, and basically do things you want to do. On the contrary, because of the expense of students working part, this is not right. It is undeniable that the risk of part-time too many hidden. For example, employees do not have insurance, out of the accident are not guaranteed. Second, the wage trap and more inexperienced people are easily deceived. The most important hope that students have their own wage-judgment. Finally, I agree with the reasons students are working. They are being responsible and making sure that you can take care of yourself and they are creating a solid foundation that you can build on to have a successful future, too. All in all, workers must tell our parents or friends to go with experience. Safety first, self-protection and self-judgment of good and bad things to ensure their own safety. This is a very good report statistical information on the report should be our reference.",B1.1
"Is important for college students to have a part-time job? I think that has much opinion to answer it. The part-time job is a job that can do in partial time. So the college student can do part-time job when they has spare time (if they want). There are many reasons why the college student do part-time job (if they do). The first are they need more money to having fun, pay the studying cost, etc. the second are they need to get job experiences for the future. College students need more money if they need it, because sometimes that the college student's money that given from their parent are not enough to solve it. So they will search a part-time job. Why part-time job? Because their study time can't be compromised with the regular job and they will need a part-time job that has unusual work time. So they can combine their studying with working in a part-time job. After the college students graduate from their university, it will be difficult to search a job. Because the Company that need worker will ask the job experiences related with the new job. So if they have not any experiences, they will be difficult to search job. So, job experiences from part-time job will be very helpful. I prefer to agree with the statement that college students must have a part-time job. It will give you an experiences about the future after you graduation, except if you didn't plan to work in the future.",B1.1
"As a college student, I have a part-time job of teaching kid. Part-time job is one of the biggest parts of my college life. Like I do, most of college students are working for part-time job and it become important part of college life. Students can get some benefits from part-time job. First, student can experience different form of society through part-time job. Before they experience part-time job, they only experienced society of school, family and friends which is very limited form of real society. If they have chance to expand their experience of many kinds of different society of relationship, such as boss and clerk in workplace and clerk and customer in the market, they can easily adapted to society when they graduate the college. Part-time job is one of the good chances to learn. Second, student can earn money from part-time job. As a college student, they have to make money for both school and pocket money themselves. They can learn how difficult to earn money and how important to spend money properly. If they never learn these before get the job, they will suffer from mistakes of misusage of money. Earning money from part-time job and use money will be good opportunity to learn economical sense. Some people can say that part-time job is wasting of time and it will make student cannot concentrate to school work. However, benefit which student can get from part-time job is important as much as school work for future.",B2
"Smoking cigarettes in the public place must be strictly prohibited and especially to the restaurants wherein people are eating foods. This attitude is very a disrespectful to others and to the food. People must go outside and find a place which is smoking area then smoke. This is the right place. Smoking cigarettes is very dangerous in our health. It can cause fat deposits to narrow and block blood vessel which leads to heart attack. It is one of the reasons why people stroke and contributes to the number of cancer and many more. There are a lot of diseases or illness that we can get if the one person undergoes to the smoking cigarettes. As I said earlier smoking cigarette can cause of multiple diseases, what more id someone who did not smoke but he/she smells the fume or smell of the cigarette? In my own understanding about this case, secondhand smoke can cause also diseases but more than to the first smoker. They suffer to the diseases that they do not do anything! And smoker out there must know their limitations about the places where they undergo smoking. Many of our fellowmen will smell the fume of cigarettes (children, adult, pregnant, and innocent people) and they may suffer. All of us know what the effects of this cigarette are. And it must be banned and implemented to the country, Not only to the restaurants but in all public places.",B1.2
"There are different pros and cons for applying part-time jobs, and there are different kinds of such jobs. The most popular part-time job is sales in restaurants and junior technical support in computer shops. Some students would apply for freelance jobs which require advanced skill sets, such as taking photographs or writing computer programs. Without doubt, part-time jobs can be an opportunity for students to earn money. Some students from families with poor financial conditions even have to work after having lessons to support the family. Other benefits of applying for part-time jobs including: Making new friends at work to enlarge the social network, learning to work with others which students may not meet before, and learn new skills which may not be included in universities course syllabus. Of course, there are cons for applying part-time jobs. Without good time management, students may not be able to balance the time and effort put in study and their part-time jobs, this can lead to a huge damage to their study life. Choosing appropriate types of part-time job is important too, otherwise students may fall into traps setup by companies with problems. In conclusion, it would be a good chance for university students to apply for part-time jobs. However, what more important is their study, students should plan well before applying for any jobs.",B1.2
" Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Nowadays, some governments have completely banned smoking at all the restaurants. This is a good idea though it is unfair to smokers. As far as I am concerned, I think this is a good rule. Firstly, smoking which leads to some diseases like lung cancer is harmful to our health. What is the worse, many people around the world died because of smoking. Besides, it is not surprising that smoking will pollute the environment by giving poisonous gas off into the air. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurants can increase waiters'working efficiency. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. What is more, some people who are allergic to smoking in the restaurants can not bear with the gas, which makes them sicker. However, many smokers complain governments have no rights to take away their freedom of smoking in the restaurants. I consider if they want to smoke, they may smoke in private, not in the public. They had better give up smoking because it is beneficial to both their health and environment. I believe if smoking is banned in all the restaurants, most of us will breath in more fresh air. Only in this way will our healthy condition be improved.",B1.2
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. We should do a lot of things in our life as many as possible. When we are college students, we have free time very much. So we have chance to do a lot of things. We should have a part-time job even if only one because it teach us the importance of earning and working for people. My parents send me money now, so I do not know the importance of earning and working for people. If I would not work until graduating *** University and I would start to work not as student, what happened to me? I think I could not go well in the company and the society because I do not know the importance of earning and working for people. And a part-time job teaches us that it is hard and difficult to work to get money. No matter how hard we work for an hour, we often get 800 yen or so. Probably we think ONLY 800! I think, when we understand those importance, we will know appreciate my parents as Thanks to my parents working hard, I can go to *** University and learn. That may be most importance of having a part-time job.",A2
"I strongly agree with the topic that smocking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people would like to have a smock after meals, and we can always find many people smocking in the restaurant. As we all know, smocking does great harm to our health and second-hand smock is even danger. As reported, second-hand smock has the same possibility to cause cancer and children are sensitive to it. So when someone smocks in public places such as a restaurant, what great harm he will do to people around him. In the meantime, it is also not a good idea to sit in a fog when we have a meal. And the smell of second-hand smock is not very good which we would never want to smell during a meal. So I always feel upset when my father smocks after meals, which does harm to everyone's health and broke the atmosphere. Above all, I suggest that smocking should be completely banned in most public places as soon as possible in the country, especially at the restaurants. And the smokers themselves should also consciously keep the smock out of restaurants, and make a better atmosphere for diners.",B1.1
"Being a college student means being independent and responsible in life. There are things that you need to start considering particularly your money or allowance. There are college students who are being supported by their parents financially but that is not the case because as a college student we must support our own needs or wants and start looking and have a part-time job. There maybe college students who don't want to work because they are still young or they are being shy but what they don't know is that having a part-time job is not just a source of extra allowance but it will also prepare you in the future after you graduate. If we have part-time job buying things we want won't be that hard anymore or we don't have to ask our parents to buy us some things. Also having a part-time job you'll learn how to budget and manage your allowance because it is your hard earned money. No matter if our parents gave us allowance it is best if we still have a part-time job because we cannot say if it is enough but if we have one we can still support whatever our needs in case we our short in budget. Not only that, because by means of part-time job we learn little by little how to be independent. That is how important part-time job is to college students.",B1.2
"I agree the argument that it is very important for college students to have a part time job. College students should share their parents' burden because the tuition is too high by doing part time job. They can be motivated to save money after difficult experience for earning money. Lastly, they can learn many useful things. Here are some reasons for this statement. First of all, in Korea, due to the high rate of tuition students have to share their parents' burdensome by doing a part time job. Korea is one of the countries which have most expensive tuition. To cut family's economic problem, students can try to earn their allowance from payment of part time job. Second, most college students do not know how hard earning money is because they are familiar with getting money from their parents. Through new experience of part time job, they can recognize thanks for parents. Lastly, from part time job, students can learn a lot of useful information. For example, they can learn the way of patience when they feel angry and the importance of keeping kind and polite attitude in social relationship. For those reasons, I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job. In Korean situation, they should share economic burden and they can learn many useful things from doing part time job.",B2
"About Smoking at the restaurants Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, various people come to restaurants. The weak person is among various people - like baby, old man, pregnant woman. It is very harmful for them. Other cancers are also affected by cigarette smoke. Smoking is little short of murder. It is not only killing you but also others. Second, it is against etiquette to smoke at table. I don't care if you smoke but you must observe the proprieties. I don't want to go to the place where fill with cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke is sewage to non-smoker. It is equate to have dinner in the toilet. Good manners are important for human relationship. They have no right mess up my lunch or dinner time. I want to eat delicious food, not cigarette smoke. This two reason are why I am against smoking at the restaurants. Restaurants purpose is to eat. It is not smoking place. If you don't want to be murderer, you don't smoke at the restaurants. If you don't able to have your precious meal time at the toilet, you don't smoke at the restaurants. I want you remember why Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.",B1.2
"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Several of my friends who are smokinï½‡ cigarette say that it is a kind of puff to smoke a cigarette. Therefore, since it thinks that a restaurant is also a place which it has not only in the place which has a meal, I think that it is not necessary to make it prohibition of smoking completely at a restaurant. However, probably, partly, there are some persons who think that a cigarette is disagreeable. Therefore, although the nonsmoking seat is prepared, since it is meaningless if it is few at a restaurant from the first and a nonsmoking seat fills, you should cope with increasing a nonsmoking seat more etc. Moreover, there may be an opinion which cares about the manners side that what is necessary is just to smoke a cigarette to except during a meal, but since it thinks that tobacco is a part of a break as stated also like the point, I think that the opinion does not have effect. Probably, the blanket ban in our country will be too severe. I am opposed to the blanket ban of the tobacco in Japan from these things.",B1.1
"The issue of banning smoking in all restaurants is one of the hardest topic need to solve in the whole world. For those who are not smoking always argued that we must ban smoking in all restaurants. One of the most important reasons is secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemical which are known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. All of them are common diseases and kill a lot of people in the world. They said that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke and it must be ban. However, there are some voices came out and argue that smoking cannot banned in all restaurant, like restaurant manager. They are afraid that it would hurt business and it is difficult to control. They think that if there is no smoking allowed, some smoking customers may not come to the restaurant again. Moreover, there are many arguments occur when the restaurant waiters try to dissuade a customer not to smoke. The restaurant waiters do not want to be hard to the customer even if they have the right to stop the smoking customers. They do not want to hurt the relationship between the restaurant and the customers. In my point of view, I agree banning smoking in all restaurants. In addition to the secondhand smoke, smoking has no advantages and what I am try to say is even banning smoking in all restaurant is not about taking away a smoker's rights. You will still have the right to smoke in your own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with.",B1.1
"Smoking is one of the worst habits an individual would have. It is commonly known that it is hazardous to our health as well as it gives disadvantages to our environment. Smoking does not only affect the smokers but it even gives more bad effect to the non-smokers. Smoking has become very common and fashionable, especially among young boys. It is a must that smoking be banned from all restaurants because as we all commonly know that smoking is dangerous to our health as well as in our environment. It also gives improper ambiance to the customers and even gives lost appetite to the customers. We know that, restaurant is almost an extension of our house, wherein, there are children that gives allergy to them. It also affects the cleanliness both air and the surroundings. As others inhale the emission of the smokers gives more harmful affect to those who were able to inhale it. Actually, in some other areas of our country smoking ban was already imposed in all public restaurants. Despite the warnings given by doctors about the ill-effects of smoking, people continue to smoke. Smokers are addicted to it; they cannot refrain from picking up a cigarette and puffing away. Some youngsters smoke for the sake of society and would make them appear liberated. As a non-smoker, I see no any advantages of having a habit of the subject except of gaining big taxes by the government. By imposing huge taxes to the manufacturers, means a high price of cigarettes. If the price is high, not all individual can afford to buy. So I think the best way to control if not eradicate smoking is to make the price very high where in not all individual can afford especially minor ages where smoking habit is being formulated.",B1.2
"Without really knowing much about the culture or the people of Japan, it would be a little ignorant for me to make a statement on this issue that would have any real impact. However, I am comfortable in stating my opinion that smoking is a terrible habit, and I try to avoid smokers in my personal and professional life as much as possible. Is extremely frustrating to work with somebody who has to leave several times throughout the hour to go engage in some activity that is literally killing them by the day, and I do not wish this fate upon even my worst enemies. As one continues their career in college, one expects himself/herself and also the people around them too overall become smarter and better people. Smoking is kind of a curious habit that has remained for reasons I cannot fully understand, but I hope that one day soon we will not have to worry about it anymore. The number of deaths every year from smoking is higher than the number of deaths from car crashes and other accidents combined, and the figures really speak volumes about the choices people are making which have direct influences on their very lives. If I had to say one way or the other, I think it would be better to lean towards the side of caution and just go ahead and ban smoking at the restaurants in Japan.",C2
"I strongly agree with the above statement for a number of obvious reasons. By now we all know the facts regarding second hand smoke and the health risk that it causes to others, especially children and babies. Smokers can no longer ignore the fact that by smoking around others, smokers or non-smokers alike, they are endangering everyone's health in that enclosed PUBLIC space. Restaurants and other enclosed public places should be accessible to anyone. By allowing people to smoke there, restaurant owners and smokers themselves are taking the rights of non smokers away. I believe that all people have the right to smoke and have no problem with that. Smokers can still smoke outside (though I do wish they were more careful about where they decided to throw out their cigarette butts!), in their homes, in their cars and in many other public areas. Many restaurants have smoking sections, but they are rarely adequately sectioned off from other areas in the restaurant and the smoke inevitably bothers other patrons. Smokers are becoming a minority with the trend for a healthier public environment on the rise, and it's about time that they realized, or rather that our government made them realize, that they can no longer put other people's health at risk for their own selfish pleasure.",C2
"I don't agree with the statement; it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think, it's important for students who are interested in having one, but not for all college students. Indeed, having a job in one's early time can be a good experience for his/her full-time work after graduation or his/her dairy life by learning social rules and communicating with other people. But, for ones who don't direct to part-time jobs, including me, working can be worthless or even painful because part-time jobs are instable in situations, working places and colleagues, on part-time job students can earn less money in contrast to his/her contribution, and at the largest point, students are fully busy in college lives. Many college students must do homework and come to university for a long way. They are also expected to do extra studies before and after lectures. So they have a little time to spend freely. A part-time job spends his/her precious time. In fact, I have only 9 lectures a week now, including 4 lectures with homework, but I have time for my hobby only on Saturday and Sunday. Even then, of course, I have to study so that the length of the free time depends on the contents of the lectures and homework. Certainly there are students who have some time and students who are attracted in working on part-time jobs. People like them will have a good time with their colleagues and customers, a pleasant of earning money, and so on. I don't deny the people getting them with their own wills. But I think it's not good to force all college students to get part-time jobs, telling that they must be good for them. Weather having a job or not should be decided by students' own.",A2
"I agree. The benefits of having a part-time job in college are just tremendous and now it is a good time for students to start working. I do believe that work is a little harder to come by now with the economy the way it is. It's pretty bad here in NZ but then I guess it is bad enough everywhere. On a positive note though, it's a chance for students to pick up some really useful knowledge and tools and also if they are lucky enough to get something, then they can use that on their resume when they go job-hunting. If they are having problems getting a job then they should look at doing some volunteer type of activities, anything that will fill up space on a blank resume. I do believe that it is important for the kids to stay positive and know that if they want their lives to improve or get the job that they want, they have to stay upbeat and optimistic as well as to keep attacking and be proactive. Companies really look for initiative in young recruits so it's a good time to practice with any skills that they think might be useful.",C2
"Smoking, the things make you happy temporarily. In the past, many people think that smoking is very smart and cool. Today, many organizations have campaign to prevent everybody from smoking.

First, you may lose your real character when you are smoking you will pick up cigarette at all time. Second, you will be a stink. Furthermore, you could have a bad health such as, lung cancer and air sac aneurysms. At this moment, many country has a law that you do not smoking in public place. This law can protect many people that hate and annoy from smoking. But, some people has breach the regulations. Consequently, everyone in their country should implant teenager to have a conscious and feel sorry for the actions. You should implant to the child that smoking cause many problems. Why are addicted to smoking. It has many reasons to addict to smoking. Friends have great influence during the ages that changing into teenage. Parenting is a part too. Everything that I have told before is a real cause of the problems. If you have a member in family who smoke you should help him to stop it.",B1.1
"I agree with part time job important to college student. Part time job means you just work a half day. So we can do anything else when we are not work. That was make students have a chance to make extra money. We can take a part time job anywhere, like restaurant or somewhere else. There are some reason why part time job was important for college students. Reason one not all student college still with their parent and their parent still paying for their school. So many student must get a part time job to pay their tuition fees. Reason two college student need to not 'put their life in parents hands'. Student must became more responsibility to their life and part time job make their more responsibility. Reason three, makes students can earn extra money. Students can use their money to pay their school, or something else. Reason four gain experience. We all know, every days we are getting older and older that means students cannot keep with their parents forever. One day, all students must work. With part time job they can gain experience that is needed when they are work. Then they became more ready to work. And last reason why part time jobs needed because part time job makes they 'sharpened' their life skills and mental. They can became skillful, confidence, and can became more sociality.",B1.2

As we are older, we should learn to be more independent and not too often rely on our parents for money nor protection. It is all part and puzzle of growing up that we will have to work sooner or later, thus why not get an experience out of it earlier? There is this phrase whereby ""not everything can be learnt in the classroom"", hence to learn more things, one should experience it themselves and therefore, working part time job might not be a bad idea after all. Furthermore, college students should learn how to manage their time, stress, studies and work well to be a better manager of themselves. This will encourage them to be young adults and taking up responsible and not running away from hardship so they will be well groomed in the future and not being afraid of hardship and also better understanding of their parents slogging out for their child's future. In conclusion, I agree to the statement. ",B1.2
"I'm strongly agree that college students should have a part-time job. Instead of put the students' nose in the book all day long, accumulate working experience is kind of ""study"" before they have graduated. And it is a big challenge. There are many sort of part-time jobs around this modern society. So, how to select the best job for we students? I think there are several conditions which we must concern about. First, we have to check our schedule. This is very important because under the pressure of studying and earning money, time is everything. Second, we have to check the content of jobs. That no need to say, we have to protect ourselves, and do what we can only do. The last one is to find the balance between school and part-time job. However, learning at school is the most important thing now in our life. Being a student, we can do whatever do want to do, but don't forget we are now only a student. Otherwise, our family may worried a lot about us. If we can find out the best way between school and part-time job, then it will be a successful beginning of our college life. So, find a part-time job, and then enjoy it!",B1.1
"Now that I am a college student I suddenly realized how hectic studying in college is, all the lessons and the activities. After a whole day in class when I go home I still need to spend hours studying the things that were taught that day. A part time job is a job that requires less hours of work and requires less than that of a regular job. Nowadays it is known in the society that most students in different countries have their part time jobs while balancing their time for their studies too. If asked for my opinion I would have to say that I have high respect for those students who have part time jobs and yet they are still able to balance their time for studying and working. Being able to do that requires perseverance and dedication. They have to work hard in school in able to learn and ingest all the information taught there and they also need to be good in managing their time with their work. I think that having a part time job is a choice of a person and a test of knowing you better and develop yourself as an individual who has self-discipline and will power.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement. We college students should have a part-time job. One reason is that we need much money. If we belong to some club, we often hold a banquet. And we sometimes go shopping and take a trip with club members or friends. We spend much money on many things. If we don't have enough money, we can't enjoy a precious campus life. We can only enjoy it once. Another reason is that we have to experience many jobs. We will get some job in the future. For this, we have to experience many jobs and know how working is and how we communicate with fellow workers and seniors. Unless we don't gain enough experience, we may fail to some job and not communicate with people well and lose some job. We are already eighteen, nineteen or twenty. We are not children. We are adults. We should not depend on our parents. We have to live our own lives in the future. So, we have to become real adults. However, there are some problems. Firstly, we should not have too many part time jobs. These may make us tired and we may not study. Secondly, we have to select a right job. We should not have a part-time job which we fit with. If we know these problems, we can enjoy a part-time job.",A2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays many college students have a part-time job. Some students did it for keep their experience, make money or for fun. But I think part-time job not good for all college students, it good for some students only. Because if college students did a part-time job they will have effect on their study and they don't have time to read or practice their learning. For some students can not arrange their time and have a bad grade, they should not did a part-time job. But if they want to do it they will wait for a good time, for example summer, holiday or their free time. Because they should keep time for study and read book. Moreover part-time job is have a good point also. It is students can make money by themselves. And they can help their parent about income and save money of family. When they need something they can buy it buy themselves don't have to disturb their parent. Whatever part-time job is not important for college students because students must be learn and grow up follow by their age. Job will make students grow over age. And if college students have problem about money for study they can request scholarship. Today have a many scholarship for poor students and good students. I think scholarship is better than college students did a part-time job.",B1.2
"We can see people with a cigarette at every corner of the world, and many governments have taken measures to deal with the problem. There are several reasons to do so. At first, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and health of people surrounds us. Some experts say that second-hand smoking is more harmful than smoking. So people smoke will do harm to non-smokers in the restaurants. It is unfair for non-smokers. So it is reasonable to ban the smoking in public places. In addition smoking shows a person's attitude. If a person smokes in the restaurant; it means he doesn't respect other people's feeling. Many non-smokers feel very uncomfortable when they smell the smoke in the restaurants. What is more, when someone is smoking around a pregnant woman, it can be very dangerous for the baby. Although many smokers say that banning smoking in the restaurants is a influence towards human's freedom and privacy, in fact, facing the death which is caused by smoking or second-hand smoking, the freedom and privacy mean nothing at all. But people do have the right to choose whether they want to have this kind of lifestyle or not. So it is really hard to ban smoking completely in all places in the country. But restaurants are public places. Thus, what we should do now is to ban smoking in the restaurants for all people's health. In a word, it is correct to ban smoking in all the restaurants because smoking is only a bad thing.",B1.1
"We college students often heard about peers' part-time job. Some are ridiculous, others maybe funny or meaningful. Whatever the experience are good or not, it's undoubted that getting par-time job has being more and more important for us. Why? You might ask. There still some think it's a waste of time. However, being intelligent in the subject has not enough for this age. In another way, what your boss wants is the real experience in your resume, not just some ""good-looking"" lines. Also, not until you star to work can you learn how to be excellent in your job, and dealing well with your companions. Thought there are still many ways to train to getting with your teammates, the real working environment can be more complicated. College student need to think more because it might cause big damage whenever one single mistake. In fact, in the material way, most college students getting part-time job just want to earn more money to fill their pockets. It's easy to understand when you can't get enough money from your parents; you need to get by yourself. From then on, you'll gradually have the sense of using money. You'll be more careful not to being out of control. I think our college life shouldn't just 'in the campuses' but more. Part-time job is a good way to us prepare for stepping into the real social system. It is important for us.",B1.2
"Having a part time job as a college student is important because it serves as a training for us even though we need to balance our study and work. I think that being a college student, if we want to buy something we really want, we should earn money by ourselves, not using the money of our parents. Using our own money, we will not feel guilty anymore. Having a part time job, we will have the working experience and have the chance to adapt the different relationship between classmates and colleagues earlier than the people who do not have the part time job. Having the working experience can help us as a college students to find the ideal job more easily in the future. And we can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in our future working circumstance. We as a college students, we can also expand our interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. I have read an article; it said, Without friends, we will not do anything perfectly. I have the same thought that Interpersonal relationship is really important in our daily life. Many people will think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help us as a college students in the future to become much better, no matter in the attitude toward money, in getting working experiences, or in interpersonal relationship.",B1.1
"Smoking is generally deemed to be a social vice by many. The issue of whether smoking should be made illegal in food establishments is debatable. While the majority --- non-smokers --- would welcome this move due to its benefits of reducing air pollution and lowering health-related problems, smokers would frown upon this decision as it would cause severe inconveniences to them. This essay shall attempt to illustrate that while smoking should be banned at restaurants, the management should take into consideration the plight of smokers and allocate a designated spot for them to take a puff. Smoking should be banned at restaurants as it would provide a cleaner environment for patrons. The absence of smoke in the air would greatly reduce the amount of pollution in the area, providing fresh air for customers. This would allow the majority of the customers, who are non-smokers, to enjoy the ambience. Furthermore, the reduction of smoke particles in the atmosphere would reduce the risks of one contracting second-hand-smoking related diseases. Hence, banning of smoking reaps many benefits that supports the decision. Nonetheless, in doing so, smokers would be sapped of the freedom to smoke before, during or after a meal. This inconvenience may propel them to avoid eating as such establishments. Such a move would result in a loss of profits on the part of restaurant owners, affecting the economic well-being of Singapore's food and beverage sector. Amidst the slow growth, a blow in the food and beverage sector could be detriment to the Singapore economy. In conclusion, while the health benefits accrued to banning of smoking is enticing, one must not neglect the financial drawbacks of such a decision. 275 words ",B1.2
"As smoking can cause lung issues and has a stronger effect on the surrounding people, some politicians hold the view that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in this country, which I can hardly approve. I have the following reasons to clarify my point. Firstly, in terms of health, it is undeniable that cigarette is not the only thing that does harm to our body. Should we ban all the fried food just because they are junk food? I think the answer should be no. Secondly, smokers' choices determine smokers' consequences. It's not our business to interfere others' lifestyles compulsorily even though it can kill them gradually. As we cannot ban suicide, we cannot ban smoking. To make us free from the infection, restaurant managers can set smoking rooms to satisfy the smokers without affecting the other customers. And we can put posters to remind the smokers the risks they are taking. But forbid? No. I agree that smoking is the last habit we could form, but since it is a controversial and complicated social issue, we should handle it carefully instead of simply forbidding it completely. We can solve the problem through different kinds of methods gradually.",B1.1
"As we know that in Pakistan, every bluffer is smoking. They smoke as other human beings eat. They consider it essential for them. It has a lot of bad effect.

As they also become patient if cancer and skin diseases the most common disease which is caused by smoke. As it cause a lot of diseases and cause air pollution so it should be banned. Due to air pollution, many diseases produce and effect the health of people. So, government shoul take some necessary steps to control it.

"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are four reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, many people go to the restaurant at lunch time and dinner time. Restaurants are the place where many kinds of people are. Smoke does their health harm. Many families with children go to the restaurant at dinner. Children are stronger effected than adults. And the research revealed that smoked people are more harmed than smoking people. Secondly, if some people smoke while the other people are having meals, people who are not smoke can't taste their meals very much because of the smoke. Thirdly, students, such as junior high school students and senior high school students, often go to the restaurant. If they see people smoke at the time, they could be affected by the scene. And they begin to be interested in smoke, in spite of be under 20, they could begin to smoke. Lastly, in these days, there are restaurants which is allowed to enter with their pets, for example they are called dog cafÃ©. Not only man but also dogs, smoking may do harm.

"Part time jobs are mainly observed in western countries although in Pakistan a few percentage of people are found. Part time jobs differs in situation wise. Mainly it is done by poor students who could not afford their academics expenses. part time jobs are performed in different forms i. e by working as a sales man, waiter, cashier or even having tuitions. Such kind of activity although is a source of assistant for their financial crisis but has a negative role regarding their studies, daily routines and even for their health situation. His main focus will be towards his income not paying too much heed towards his studies and health. It has few positive aspects also. It creates a sense of responsibility, a way of support to their finance. If part time job is done in their own field of subject then it will be an extra and practical help to their studies. If some one has the capability to manage his daily routine even doing part time job then its better to do a part time job then remaining free and he secures himself from bad company. The preference depends upon the individual himself. If he wants to do a part time job, he may get some time, otherwise he may want to spend this time with his family or friends.",B1.1
"As a college student, we aren't very busy so that we can spend a lot of time in doing the things we like. Some students do sports, such as playing football, running. Some students play computer games, such as dota, dnf. Some students read books, such as novels, poetry. What I think the most important thing we should do in the free time is doing a part-time job. College is an important place connecting school and society. We do not only learn knowledge here, but also learn experience which we can't learn from class. So having a part-time job can solve this problem. In fact, a part-time job can make our college life substantially. From the part-time job, we can learn how to deal with work problem, how to work with others. We can also develop good habit. What is the most important; we can understand how hard the making money is, so that we can make a good preparation for the later life. College life is colorful, so we don't need to study too hard as senior high school. We should learn to allocate our time and know what we really need. Having a part-time job is important to us; it's not only an opportunity, but also a challenge.",B1.2
"In this time of tough job market, we need more than just a degree to get a job. Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to field of study, will give an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that have had some real-world, adult experiences and that can handle yourself outside of campus. Aside from making more employable after college, having a part-time job will help financially. A part-time job can help pay for living expenses, including food, books, things, and clothes. This way, not overwhelmed with monthly payments when find self working a much lower paying job than you had hoped for right after college. Taking on financial responsibility also takes some of the load off of my parents' shoulders if they are helping me with my expenses. Parents will not be around forever, and so you have to gradually become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner begin this process, the easier it becomes and the faster become 100% independent financially. Therefore I agree that it is important for a college student to have a part time job.",A2
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The basis that smoking should be completely banned is that the smoke produced from smokers are proven to be hazardous to health and it can be a nuisance to restaurant-goers as smoking is a form of air pollution. Firstly, scientific studies have proven that second-hand smoke - smoke produced from smoking - pose a bigger health threat than smoking itself because the smoke produced contains more carcinogens and unfiltered chemicals than what is inhaled by the smoker. Allowing smoking at restaurants would expose health threats to everyone especially more so for children and the elderly. Most restaurants are are-conditioned and this makes it worse because there is no ventilation of the smoke produced and it is inevitable that restaurant-goers would have to inhale and bear the smoke produced. Secondly, smoking is an air pollution and can disrupt restaurant goers from enjoying their meal and company. Most restaurant goers would simply want to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant without having to deal with the unnecessary smoke or the unpleasant smell that smoking produces unless they are smokers themselves. For the greater public good, smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country as restaurants should be respected as public places equivalent to hospitals, schools and airports where the smoking ban has already been imposed. Also, it is not completely unreasonable to ban smoking completely at restaurants because there are other more suitable and appropriate areas for smokers to smoke. ",B1.2
"I agree. The First, smoking can threaten the health. As a report, a cigarette contains more than, 000 different toxic or poisonous chemicals such as nicotine and carbon dioxide. This chemical ingredients threaten the health especially lung. Smoking leads not only smokers but also non- smokers to die. According to a survey, more than 50, 000 Americans die from secondly hand smoke (SHS) every year. Of those, , 000 American non-smokers die from lung cancer. Like this, not only smokers but also SHS could cause the lung cancer. Therefore the public smoking should be prohibited. Second, smoking can make the public space especially campus unpleasant environment. A poison gas and a harmful content of e cigarette can pollute the air of public space. The campus space must be a safe and pleasant environment for faculty, staff and students. Smoking in campus of the public space plays a role in causing unpleasant environment. As a survey at Utah State University about 80% of students would support a policy making the campus completely smoke-free. Most of the air pollutes the clean air of campus which is made of trees and then the students are not pleasant. Smoking in the public space especially campus should be prohibited.",B1.2
"I really agree about this topic. College Students pays for college tuition is very expensive. Expensive tuition is a burden on the parents. As adults, reducing the economic burden is not unusual. Through the part-time job, Students cannot learn in school can learn social experience. Part-time jobs experience that is indirectly. Part-time jobs make a person high. Students can cultivate a team spirit. And they can cultivate independence. College Students learns the importance of money and they will learn how to save. Some students go to abroad to study foreign language. And outside of school work to do additional experience will be enriched by the economic. For example, go to travel abroad, buy a book, buy shoes, Leisure activities, go to the movie, eat delicious food, buy a girlfriend's gift, buy a parent's present, pay bills etc. Also part-time job helps in the formation of connections and patience is raised. Part-time job will be motivated to study hard. Hard job makes a strong. Studying is important than part-time job. Studying is always more important than many money.

"Doing a part time job is a good idea for teens. We never know what will happen in the future, so doing a part time job is a good way for us to try different matters and to accumulate our working experiences. However, we have to think twice as we decide whether we are going to do part time jobs or not. To begin with, the reason we choose to do a part time job instead of doing other activities is quite important. I believe that someone who does a part time job just for salary, they are wasting their time and energy on trifles. On the other hand, if we can learn something never being taught at schools or in textbooks from the experience, it is worth for us to pay our time and energy on it. In addition, a work type is also an essential element we have to consider. For example, working in a pub is not a good idea for teens. For the foretasted reasons, I think that doing a part time job may be a good step to the adult, but there is still something we have to put our eye on it, or there is no difference between doing a part time job and spending time on other activities.",B1.1
"Personally I agree with this statement. Does't like meddle school or high school where students' main duty is to learn hard and try to be enrolled in a good college, college's flexible environment enable its students to develop themselves in a all-around way. Many people has the opinion that studying in a college is the preparation to be engaged in the complex social enviroment and that's the idea I appreciated. A part-time job will provide students a opportunity to contact society in a early time. Many students will feel at sea once they graduate from the college if they don't have a well preparation for integrating into the society. Then comes part-time jobs advantage: it will force students learn to communicate with other people and to deal with kinds of situations like having conflicts with their boss, colleagues and so on. However there comes the voice that taking a part-time will greatly occupy students'time and distract them from their study. As far as I'm concerned, I argue against this opinion. By doing a part-time job, we can apply what we learn in the class into practise. Through this way we can have a better understanding of the knowledge and gain experience what we can't get from teacher in class. For the reason I state above, I strongly appreciate that college students should take a part-time job.",B1.2

I strongly agree on this topic, that is, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the restaurants are the places where people can eat some meal. Someone make people feel unhappy as smoking in the restaurants. Since the smell of smoking is not a good, people cannot breathe well in there. Second, the tobacco is a harmful thing to our health. It is not good to anyone who smoking or not. The bad thing must be banned by law or anything. Third, there are smoking areas in the side of the restaurants with changing social perception only for smokers. This is a good way to avoid harm to non-smokers.

"This year, Japan government has started the Taspo which is a card system to be intended to prevent under 20s from purchasing any cigarettes by vending machines. In most of the indoor places, except for the small smoking space, it is made all placs no smoking. There are many railroad companies which make the inside of the station concourse no smoking all day. Recently, it is that expanding people regard smoking as perfect evildoing. In this current, it is natural that smoking is prohibited at all the restaurants. It is to be well known and the smoking person begins the disease of the breathing system in several times compared with the person who doesn't. Also, if they are near the habitually smoking person, their risk to become a lung cancer with the passive smoking has become high. The persons who are too young to be permitted to smoke come to the restaurant.

"I agree with this. Because smoking is really bad for health, it's my main reason. I heard that it's poisonous to smoke somebody's smoke. I mean if someone smoke in front of non-smoker, the non-smoker could be affected sometimes more than smokers. Some restaurants separate the seat for non-smoker, but the smoke could reach to non-smoker. In the restaurant, we should enjoy the dishes without smoke. In many countries, smoking in the restaurant is not arrowed. Japan is too unconscious about smoking problem. There's no good point to smoking. We have to think about this more seriously. Me, I don't smoke and I really hate smoking. But actually I have many friends who smoke. I can't say them to stop smoking though I worried about their health, as I also know how hard to stop it and they want to stop if they can. One of my friends who often smoke said that she doesn't know how to stop smoking so she wants something changeable stuff without poisonous. I don't think smoking should be banned completely everywhere so far because it would be so hard for smokers, but I hope something changeable stuff will be made as she said. What I want to say is that smoking should be banned at least in the restaurants, but not everywhere. We should think for not only non-smokers but also smokers.",B2
"Smoking laws have always been a hotly debated topic in Singapore. It is true that smoking is detrimental to the health of the smoker and everyone around, but the smoker also argues that it is in his own right and freedom in which he choses to do what he wants. As smoking bans are popping up virtually everywhere in the country, smokers find it more and more difficult to find places where they can smoke, legally. This is actually the intended effect of the government --- for smokers to smoke less/stop smoking because of the huge inconvenience factor. Referring to smoking bans in restaurant, I believe that following the general smoking ban requirements; all indoor restaurants should completely ban smoking. It is unfair for other guests to put up with the smoke and subject their health to risks simply because of other inconsiderate smokers. In fact, a large number of non-smokers actually detest the smell of smoke. However, pertaining to individual rights, I believe that some outdoor restaurants could cordon off an area for smokers. This way, both sets of people have a right to do things which are of their interest. Therefore, I do not believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. ",B1.2

First, a part time job will be an excellent experience for your life because the job can give any things to you which cannot find from the campus. You will see many people who have many emotions. Moreover you will practice other skill such as attempt, tolerance and other. Second, a part time job can help me to support my financial status because it makes me to save money that come from my parent.

"Nowadays, our society is full of many college students, however, most of them do not understand the works which they really want or they are really suitable. So I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Partly because by taking a part-time job can make college students know more about the related works, and partly because they can learn more knowledge in different areas, and partly because they can experience many different lives. Maybe college students will meet some difficult or some trap, but these things can be something help you in the future. But we also should notice some things, for example, we should be careful when taking a part-time job, we have to take care of ourselves, and most important is that we must not give up our majority. We have to put our schoolwork on the top one, that is, we should pass all of the subjects safely at least, but not failed. After all, being a college student is what you need to do now, so I think that if college students want to take a part-time job, they should also take much time to do their schoolwork.",B1.1
"I don't agree with this statement that college students should have a part-time job because I feel that they have many other priorities that should come ahead of whatever small money they might be able to make by having a part-time job. Students who flounder their time on part-time work will undoubtedly find that their grades are slipping, and this is something that can affect their entire future because once you get some bad grades, it is very difficult to bring your GPA back up. Of course many companies would like for students to have a part-time experience, but a good GPA is also a good way of showing that you are responsible and hardworking. I think that students should be able to have the liberty to take the time after graduating to learn more about being really serious in working, so they should save part-time employment for immediately after graduation or for maybe in the summers when they don't have as much to do. Therefore, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job as any benefits they might gain will be offset by the gains they will make after graduation and enrollment in the industry.",C2
"I strongly agree simply because we need to ask ourselves what is most important in this situation, human life or monetary gain. I feel that most people would agree that human life is far more important and since we only have one life, it is important that we do what we can to protect ourselves and each other, from unnecessary risks and dangers. Smoking is risky and smoking is dangerous and I feel that most reasonable people would have no problem in accepting bans on smoking in restaurants or anywhere else where smoke poses a threat to human health. I f restaurant owners were to calculate the figures correctly, they would soon understand that they wouldn't make as much profit if their customers started dying off or were to ill to dine at their restaurants. Whatever monies were lost due to an initial ban would be recoverable over a longer period of time. From a moral point of view, restaurants should not have any problem with accepting bans because of the obvious dangers smoking poses to their customers. Neither should Japan's government hesitate in introducing these bans based on the public's approval. In spite of whether the public or restaurants approve or disapprove, the bans should be put into effect.",C2
"It is important part time job for university student. These days, the university registration fee is so expensive. Most of students think intolerable without part time job. This is reason that I have to part time job. During summer vacation I worked in fashion store. The task is so hard for me. But I need its salary. And part time job is helpful build our broad experience. While I work at store, i met the numerous people. Sometimes rude customer had come to store, I was upset their incomprehensible action. But in the service industry, clerk always serve the customer kindly. So I should bear it and make a smile. I learned about customer service and build a good human relationship. This is a lesson to me for society. Lastly, I feel a sense of accomplishment in my part time job. This is positive change in my life. When I worked well I feel exciting and it give me self-confidence and energy. I realize that working time to be fun! Living expenses and extensive experience are essential to university student and sense of accomplishment change the student. For this reasons, I agree that part time job is important to university student",B1.2
"I am partly for the perspective that all the restaurants in the country should prohibit from smoking. As you know, restaurant is the place where people have their meals. What the most important for the restaurant it to keep the environment clean and the dishes tidy. If the guests smoke, he or she will probably pollute the surroundings. Worse still, they might drop the smoke ask on the table or the dishes. Accordingly, it is necessary for every restaurant to prevent from smoking. Only in this way can we have a better circumstance for our dinners in the restaurant. However, there are possibly some bad effects on this action. On one hand, smoking is the sign of man. The relationship between smoking and man is as important as that between making-up and woman. Thus, man at the restaurant especially during the time of having dinner seems to be superior to others. They may feel that this is the representative of their social status. On the other hand, people like businessman sometimes smoke at the restaurant in order to cope with some difficulties and promote the negotiation smoothly. All in all, I partly agree with the point of view of banning smoking totally at all the restaurants in our country.",B1.1
"Most of college students in the world have so much leisure time as a college student. Spending their leisure time for doing something that has no use for them is frequently seen. According to my friends in college, they often spend their time only for playing computer games, shopping, and anything else which really waste their time. Then what we should do as a college student to have useful leisure time? The answer is having a part time job. It is important for college students to have a part time job. It is because we already have a certificate from our senior high school. Some of job doesn't need any special requirements. For example, we can be a waiter or a waitress in a restaurant or maybe a private teacher for elementary students and junior high students. What job we can do depends on our skill and our respect for this problem. If you can draw then you can work as a teacher that only teaches drawing. There is a lot of advantages by having a part time job for college student. First, you can have additional money for yourself that can be used for paying your school or sometimes for buying something you really want. Second, by having a part time job, you can have more experiences so you could know how hard earning money is and you could the situation in the work place. Third, you can turn your leisure time into a useful one. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part time job because it has a lot of benefits for us.",B1.2
"I slightly agree the importance of a part-time job for college students. First, I think the chief reason for going to school is to learn. Some people may think they can also learn a lot in a part-time job. But, the things could learn from job we also could lean from school too. We are students, the first thing for us is to increase our knowledge of what we major, if the job is most important then you don't have to go to school. And the things we can also learn in school include the attitude for how should we treat other people, how to blending with others, how to reach a goal, etc. These things we can learn not only from jobs but college. Second, some people may try to earn some other money for live a good life. But I think most of college students are working for the pocket money, not the cost of living. In this situation, it would not be a problem of living for if you don't have a part-time job. So I only agree the importance for college students to have a part-time job is whose income is for living or tuition.",B1.1
"Nowadays, the question whether college students should have a part-time job or not has attracted many people's attention. Some people think students should have part-time jobs to train themselves for future. Others say that students should not have a part-time job because study is more important thing for students. I think there will be many advantages for student to do a part-time job. First of all, if students do part-time job, they can learn experience and get training. They can learn knowledge they cannot find from their books in the school. So in the future, when they try to find a job, they find they have more advantages than other students. Secondly, we can get money. Some of us are from poor families. We can pay tuition and buy something we want if we earn money by ourselves. It can release our parent's burden. In China, we all think that friends are very important. We can meet many people when we do part-time jobs. They can make friends with us and we can benefit from their knowledge and information. Of course, study is still the most important thing for us. We should take care of both study and part-time job. You cannot spend all the time in part-time job. If we make careful plan, it will be ok. All in all, I think there are more advantages doing a part-time job because we can get experience, more friends and money. If you can have time, try to do a part-time job.",B1.1
"There are two types of jobs one a full time job and a part time job. A man who is doing full time job do his duty all the day. But a man who is doing part time job do his duty for some time. A part time worker can do his job in morning and he can also do it in the evening. But some people do it at night. In this world every thing is costly. Most of the part time jobs are in foreign coutnires. The people of foreing countries do more part time jobs as compared to us because in foreign country their is tadency of part time jobs. Peoples do this job at pizza huts, hotels and offices. But a man who do work all the day and then do part time job disturb his social life he can not give his time to his family and can not make tours to friends and do not make recreational trips. He became a machine and this casues a mental problem. A women that is doing part time job can not give time to his childrens and husbands. They can not give time to their home. Students do it to meat his needs for study purpose but can not gave time to study and this makes his future loss.",B1.1
"Most of the people make part-time jobs a way to earn extra money. Some of them do part-time job to sweep away the boring feeling and keep them busy. Only a few would grant it as a chance to gain work experiences, broaden horizons, enhance personal growth and prepare for future career. However, is it necessary for a university student to obtain the aforesaid through a part-time job? For university students, working experiences are quite important in job hunting or planning their future career. A part-time job may not be able to provide suitable experiences or details for a certain career. Contrarily, many internship programmes and career developing courses offered by the university allow students to acquire what they want. Therefore, part-time job seems not so important. Besides, many mentorship and exchange programmes are also offered to increase student's social or global knowledge and let them to catch up with the changing world. Through organizing activities or projects for some societies, students can learn about independence, responsibility, respect and some skills like leadership and communication, which are all important in personal development. Since what students can obtain from the university are much more than the part-time job, it is not so necessary for a university students. In addition, there are many facilities available in university including sports hall, music room and library. Students can do what they want in their leisure time so they will never feel boring in the university and even need not to find a part-time job to keep them busy. All in all, the university can give even much more than what part-time job could provide for a student. Therefore, part-time job is not necessary for university students.",B1.2
"I think that smoking is hazardous to the health of people who smoke and those around because smoking contains a lot of toxic to the cancer cause. In restaurants that people regarded as a public service generally used to relax and eat food that we want the taste of good food and good atmosphere. I was the one who hate the tobacco and all about smoking. When I saw anyone who is going to smoking, I will go outside that place or go out. I think they should go smoke in the smoke that the restaurant provided or should not smoke because it is not time to smoke when you go to the restaurant. They should think it is time for eating, they should have fun for eating and enjoy the taste. Why they have to smoke in the restaurants, that doesn't make any sense for me at all. To smoke outside will not disturb the people around you so it might be good for other people. They should honor and respect the privacy of others. I agree with them so that prohibited smoking at restaurant because at least we can place free from tobacco smoke causes cancer and the environment around us is not good to have delicious food. Free from toxic environments.",A2
"Nowadays, an increasing number of college students are taking part-time jobs for many different reasons. We all know that not everyone is given a chance to go to school and some students have to find a job for them to be able to support their needs especially their studies. A part- time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. Workers are considered to be part-time if they commonly work fewer than 30-35 hours per week. We cannot erase the fact that part-time job for students is beneficial. First, part-time job can help students earn money which will be useful to support their basic needs in school and at the same time relieve their parents ' burden. Second, it also needs communication skills when you are taking an interview to get the job, as there are many other competitors. If you fail to take the first job, you will take efforts improving yourself to win the next. Lastly, doing part-time jobs is not only a process of self-development, but also a process of experiencing social life, which will contribute to their job-searching in the future. However, there are also some disadvantages in doing a job while studying. Students doing part-time jobs are busy running between the working place and their school. As a result, they get tired, and even skip classes to have a sleep after hard working. It can also affect their study habit. Moreover, it can worsen their health in the long run. Nevertheless, part-time jobs are worthy because it will teach us one important lesson in life, it is to value our education. This will be the only key for us to find a stable job and a better life in the future.",B1.2
"It depends on the person's need. Different students have different needs. For a rich one, they do not have to consider whether they have money to live or not. However, for a poor one, having a part-time job is very important. But there are some students will have a part-time job in order to get job experiences. For me, having a part-time job is quite important. My parents cannot send too much money for me as allowance, so if I want to buy some new stuff, go to the restaurant or go traveling, etc. I have to deal with the spending myself. But having part-time jobs is not only to earn some money as allowance but also to get some experiences. Therefore, I always make myself have two part-time jobs during each semester. One, the key-in job, is for my daily lives, and another, school office helper, is for the experience. Both of them are simple jobs and can earn 95 NT dollars at each hour. Although, having a part-time job, for some students, is quite important. Safety is also important. That is why my two part-time jobs are both provided from my school, NCCU. The importance of having part-time jobs is different from different students. As long as you need, then just go to find one. But we college students all have to remember not only taking the responsibility to the job but protect ourselves",B2
" I'm completely for the idea that banning smoking at all the restaurants. I even hope that banning smoking could be conduct at all public situations. As is known to all, smoking is unhealthy. It will bring cancer to the one who smoke. And the serious effect is not only for the smokers, but also the people around the smokers. In a restaurant, whether large or small, there are always so many people seated, eating and more importantly, breathing. Once there is a person smoking, the smell flows. It is just like a terrorist making a gas bomb gone off. Then suddenly the surrounding will be full of that smell and many people will begin to cough and feel sick. On the other hand, the smell of smoking will no doubt make the other customers feel that the food in the restaurant isn't yummy. And they will comment that this restaurant is not a good destination for dinners. In that way, it may reduce the restaurant's reputation. Of course the smoker won't think that it is them who add the bad reputation to the restaurant, so the only way to prevent the restaurants from losing customers is banning smoking. Now that there is no good to smoke in the restaurants, we should ban it completely.",B1.2
"Three reasons that we must not smoke The smoking has been a topic problem. Many people know that smoking is not good for us, but the number of smoking people is gradually increasing. The age of smoking is lower and lower than before. The problem of smoking is come to the fore. Therefore, I want to tell you why we must not smoke by three reasons. First of all, smoking increases the risk of cancer. As you know, the cancer of the lungs is the typical harm of smoking. Besides, the various cancers can also happen easily. Secondly, smoking is a cause of sterility. Nowadays, smoking rate of women is increasing gradually, so the rate of sterility by smoking is also increasing. The study found second-hand smoking is also a cause of the sterility. Third, smoking has many bad effects to children. Many fathers smoke at home, but smoking has bad effects to children's growth, respiratory organ and so on. Especially, It is the worst to the children who have atopy. Women's smoking rate is increasing gradually. Besides, the children's smoking rate is increasing too. We have to suggest ways about smoking problems. We must think that smoking increases cancer rates, sterility and children's health problems.",B1.1
"I agree with the band of smoking at all restaurants. Smoking is a bad habit that most Filipinos have. It will cause various diseases, symptoms and abnormalities in the human body for the very addictive. This is a good band to propose as it may decrease the number of Filipino smoker in the country. And it will also clear the air and prevent unwanted passive smoking. It is a good way to limit the smokers ' places to smoke so he/she may get rid of his/her very bad habit. And also to some who doesn't like the smell of those cigarettes, it will give them a place of haven. This will also protect them from passively smoking. Nothing good ever comes out of it, even though some say it's very stress relieving. But of course, a lot of other people will disagree with this so to prevent any miscommunication they should be given a place close for them only. The decision of a person to smoke should not affect the welfare of others. So in simpler and shorter terms, like a phrase I read from a post, ""a smoker's poor choice should not affect the health and welfare of others him/her. """,B1.2
" I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It provides them with opportunities to venture into society and acquire life skills which can only be picked up from experience. For example, we see college students working as frontline part-time salespersons attending to customers when they need help. Through this, they learn to communicate with their customers. When they meet with different situations, such as difficult customers, they learn to deal with it effectively too. These skills will be crucial when they enter the workforce in the future. Not only that, some college students find that their parents are not giving them enough allowance and so, I feel that the best way for them to finance themselves will be to have a part-time job. Rather than asking their parents for more cash, it will be more appropriate for them to take up a part-time job to earn money. This way, they will become independent persons and learn to treasure what they have. In essence, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, I feel that it is also necessary for them to be able to multitask and be responsible for their own studies too. ",B1.2
"I agree that smoking should be banned.. Because many people didn't smoke in the restaurants. People feel uncomfortable when they breathe. And it's bothering them. Can you imagine, when you are eating and there is someone besides you are smoking? It must be uncomfort right? So I agree that smoking must be prohibit in the restaurants. Sometimes there is a baby or a child in the restaurant, and they must caught because there is someone smoke in there. It's not good for their health. Smoking in the restaurants is selfish. Why don't go outside and smoking in the outside of the restaurants. Sometimes they don't think the impact of smoking in the restaurants. But it's not good for their health. not only for their health but also for people around them's heath. So, some restaurants have a smoking area to solve this problem. Where the smokers stay there to smoke. It is very efficient because the smokers stay with the smokers also. But some restaurants did not provides the smoking area. This is the problem then. If you disagree the statement above, you must make sure that all of restaurants in this country have a smoking area. And all of the people can feel comfort.",B1.1
Some students and people do part time jobs to fulfill their needs. Most of the students are forced to do a part time job. Because their expenses. In this way they have to work late at night and after this they have to pay some time to their studies. They can not give full attention to their studies as result they get low grades or they are failed. This disheartens them and they left their studies. In the result our country is going back in academic field. Most of the student adopts the part time job to spend their free time. They have interest in this job and do very well in both in studies and job. This type of job keeps them from the bad habits. Part time jobs have both beneficent and disadvantage. Because the students who are brilliant and they do a part time job can afford all his expenses and live a happy. But the student who are weak in their studies and are forced to do a part time job can not pay attention to both things and their both economic and academic carrier is destroyed. Therefore we can not say any thing about part time job because it is useful for some people and it is also a problem for some other people. We can only give our blessings to the people to duties well.,B1.1

I should think positively about part-time job. Both work and personal life because it can. I hope it is not bad I think the transition should be. Tuition comes a lot of talk recently on the news. Tuition is expensive. So people are hard to. So, students must earn money, part-time job. Should help in some way. Tuition should go down Attends a school not too expensive There is a lot of fighting going on. Lower tuition to that fact is not. Should pick up visions of them dividends. It is a bad idea.

"I agree with the point that it is very important that college students have part-time jobs. I have some reasons. Setting foot in college also means entering the society. High school students have a great desire to know what does the adult world really like. There is no doubt that taking part-time job is their choice. Not only experts but parents suggest our freshmen or higher class college students to have experience of part-time jobs. My father told me that part-time job is a challenge; and I will be confronted with difficulties. Whether the difficulties the part-time job is, which is not significant to concern. We only try, devote emotion and to be hardworking is enough. Thus the more effort we make, the more we will gain. The essential thing is that we can learn how to manage a work and succeed. Furthermore, taking part-time job is paid. Money always is a motion for working. Do you think it is attractive?Generally speaking, taking a part-time job brings college students an advanced impression about the future working life. That precious experience will a cause a great influence and it is beneficial. So if you have time, don't wait and try to find a part-time job.",A2
"Restaurants are the places where we enjoy dishes' pleasant smell, good flavor, conversation with friend and so on. When someone begin smoking in the restaurant, people surrounded him must be hurt their feelings because the smoke makes the dishes' tastes and the atmosphere in the restaurant bad. So the restaurant's customers are not satisfied in dishes. This might be responsible for the restaurant's unpopularity. In terms of health, the effect of passive smoking on human is grater the that of inhaling smoking. In other words, passive smokers are apt to be taken ills including cancer of the lungs. If someone begin smoking in public space, he do damage to people who surrounded him. Namely, smokers who smoke in a crowded space, they reduce the length of other people's life. How guilty it is! Smokers must be considered the place for smoking wherever they are. Recently, there are many restaurants that make smoking sections. But nonsmokers often sit down and eat in the smoking sections if nonsmoking sections' seat is filled. So if smokers want to smoke, they should be outside the restaurant, or the master of the restaurant is ought to provide the smoking area for only smokers. If so, nonsmokers cannot smoke passively.",A2
"Nowadays, smoking can see at every place. It is a addict-activity. Some people think smoking is a fashion, somebody thinks it looks smart. But it's not at all, smoking can destroy their health and closed people. In my opinion, smoking is a bad doing because it disturb other people who don't like smoking, make their health worse and make pollution. Smoking in the publish place such as bus stops, park or the open area. It's harmful for both smoker and closed people. If smoker smoke in the close area especially the restaurant where a lot of people come to eat foods or drinks. It can disturb another people and make a pollution in the restaurant. When smoker start to smoke in the restaurant, the air conditioner will receive a bad smell and it will be around the restaurant, that is hard to get rid of it. It will make unhappy, moody, etc. for people who need a good food, good drink, good surrounding in the restaurant. However, the restaurant should make non-air conditioner place for the smoker who want to smoke when they wait foods. Moreover, smoking is destroy their health. It can cause cancer and many other symptoms both smoker and non-smoker. So, I agree that the smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country.",B1.1

Many non-smokers hate it. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are lots of people hate smoking in public places have to suffer from second-hand smoke. So forbidding smoking at all the restaurant in the country is necessary. Smoking directly contributes to a large number of diseases, such as lung cancer. People like smoking have higher probability to suffer a cancer. People likes smoking also seems to live a shorter life. Smoking makes the environment in the restaurants bad, drives people into a bad mood and makes people cannot enjoy their delicious food. Smoking can also contribute to lots of accident in the restaurants. Lots of fires are caused by lighted cigarette butts, such fires always cause bad injure and big financial lose.

Managing the time is the important thing if we wont get something loss. So have part time job is important for collage student. Because many advantages that we can get from it.

"In my opinion, smoking in the restaurants has to prohibit for non-smoking people. I think smokers have to think for other people. Although, seats separate smoking area and non-smoking area in restaurant, smoke can't intercept perfectly. There are two reasons why I think forbid smoking in the restaurants. First, smoke is very bad to people. In restaurant, there are not only smokers. There are babies, children, old people and non-smokers. For them, smokers don't permit smoking in the restaurants. That is the first reason smoking prohibit in the restaurants. Second, it is not good for reasons of sanitation. Some smokers spit on the floor and flick the ashes off a cigarette. Smell is disgusting. I think some smokers don't like smell also. That is the second reason smoking forbid in the restaurants. In conclusion, I think smoking in the restaurants has to prohibit for other people and it is bad for reasons of sanitation. In addition, smoking in the restaurant is banned legally. Many people don't know about that. For all of us, smoking in the restaurant has to prevent more strongly. Smokers have to care him or herself because smoking is so bad for health.

"It is not important for college students to have a part-time job. First and foremost, it can be physically straining for the students should they take up a part-time job. Having a part-time job would mean that a student would have to travel to the workplace, work for a stipulated number of hours and then travel back home. On top of that, the student would have to travel to school and sit in lectures for long periods of time. Over time, the student would feel physically tired trying to balance out work and school. This could negatively influence their grades since the student is not in tip-top condition to study effectively. Therefore, it is not advisable for college students to take up a part-time job. Also, the time spent earning money while doing a part-time job can be used for revision instead. With more time for revision, the student would be less likely to suffer from stress due to last minute cramming for the exams. Hence, it would be a better idea to dedicate the extra time that they have to their studies instead of working part-time. Lastly, one may argue that a student can gain more pocket money or support the family through working part-time. However, if the student is truly in need of finances, one can always apply for financial assistance to alleviate their financial strain. Thus, there is no need for one to take up a part-time job while one is studying in college. In conclusion, the most important job for a student is to work hard in their studies so that they can excel and in future, they would be able to land a proper full-time job.

"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have three reasons. First, if students have a part-time job, they can know how they work in society. they will have to work when they graduate their colleges. So I think they should have time to prepare for working in society. Second, If they work in various situations, they will learn how they communicate with people. College students should experience various situations. Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate their colleges. So they must earn some money to use then. I think it is too late for them to earn money when they become emploees. Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money. However, the most thing they should do is study. College students should have enough time to study. It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard. College students don't have to earn too much money. So I think they should work on summer vacation, winter vacation, etc. If they experience working, it make their life more valuable thing.",A2

But the mostly it is taken into consideration that these students are mostly interested into their student. So they for their studies start part time jobs to meet their needs in the studies. The part time jobs are not bad because they come to know how to make their nation strong with these hardworking students of the country. Due to this part time job there is also bad effect on their studies they do not need much time to do their self-studies. There health is also disturbed that they do not need any time to take rest. Government should take the serious action on this dominating issue, because in this stage of life of students they are selecting their professions government should offer different funds for these poor people so that they do not consider the difficulties as a stumbling blocks in their path.

Smoking is addictive and is a waste of money. The only reason why smokers continue to smoke despite this harmful effects is that smoking allows them to be high, and to feel good. this I feel, is outrageous, I do not see how getting lung cancer in the long run could make one feel good about themselves, and the people around them. This smoking behaviour which they deemed to be cool, is the most irresponsible behaviour one could ever have. All the smokers think about is those few minutes of feeling good from inhaling those nasty stuff down their lungs, and does not spare a thought for the people around them. I find smoking a complete waste of time and money. I do not agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As much as i wish they would be banned, this would cause unhappiness among the smokers. However i feel that smokers should only be allowed to smoke outdoor. By smoking indoor, they can cause others to breathe in unnecessary second hand smoke, which is very inconsiderate to other users. As much as i wish smoking could be banned across the country i understand that a far bit of tax revenue comes from ciggarette, however is it rightful of the government to generate tax this way? to generate tax at the expense of its citizens? i do not think so. for the health of every one in the country i feelthat smoking should be as illegal as how marijuana is. it is a drug as well, how is it less severe.

"Smoking should be stopped in society because it makes bad surrounding and air pollution. There are many people smoke in every place such as at school, at university, at hospital, and restaurant. I think we should be banned smoking because it annoy public environment and make bad pollution. There are three reasons why smoking should be banned and stopped in restaurant. First make bad surrounding, second make air pollution, and last make you bad behavior. First of all, why we should banned smoking in restaurant because it make everyone in the restaurant annoy smoke from smoker. When you dinner in the restaurant you must need good surrounding and good atmosphere. If there are many smoking in the restaurant it will make the costumer complaint. Second, why we should stopped smoking in the restaurant because it can make air pollution. When we stay in the restaurant or another side in Thailand we can see a lot of people smoking. It can make every area full of smoke and make air pollution to other places so, the smoking should be banned. Last reason, why smoking should be banned since it can make you bad behaviors when you smoking in the public area. Many people do it everyday life to smoke so, it be come to your behavior. Especially, when you join to each other in society you should not do it because it shows you manner to other person. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in the restaurant. There are three reasons; make bad surrounding, second make air pollution, and last make you bad behavior.",B1.1
"Today, smoking is banned at most places. This is the reason why people became regard smoking as harmful and annoyance recently. Certainly, smoke of smoking do harm to your and other's body, and heating cigarettes cause by fire and burn, and some people throw their cigarettes on the road, river and so on. Most people hope not to smoke exclude in specific spaces. To buy cigarettes and smoking is to buy and throw about poison and to burn your money by yourself. If you smoke, your family and your friend must not feel comfortable. Similarly, people hate smoke and odor. Especially, in the restaurants, cleanness is lost and people cannot enjoy a dinner by your smoking. Nobody want to eat a dinner in place where is smoky and bad-smelling. Looks and smells of dishes are important to enjoy dinner. In the restaurants, you can enjoy not only eating but also talking with your family, friends and colleagues. The smell is not spices or sources but nicotine and the smoke make you cough and your eyes are sore and eventually you cannot concentrate on your eating and talking. Thus, you cannot have a nice time in the restaurants. Above all, smoking when you eat is bad manners. Smoking must be banned in places not only of eating but also where smoking makes a lot of people annoying.",A2
"Having a part time job imposes both positive and negative effects on a college student. On a positive perspective, working part time at a young age prepares a student for real life after schooling. He/she is trained to be more responsible as he/she progresses in his/her job. When a college student works part time, he/she also achieves a sense of fulfilment in what he/she does. Once he/she sees a pay check with his/her name on it, the sense of achievement he/she gets is unparalleled. Moreover, a college student who works part time can foresee and ultimately discover what career would fit his/her skills; if ever his/her skills do not fit his/her ambitions, he/she can then focus on developing the skills needed to match that ambition. Money-wise, a college student who has a part time job can easily assist whoever is financing his/her studies. On the other hand, working part time can also make a student less focused on his/her schooling. Although he/she is preparing himself/herself for the real world through work, a degree matched with honors and achievements is what an aspiring employee would need to get into a proper job. In addition, a college student may be discouraged to pursue his/her degree if he/she entertains the thought that the job he/she has can already sustain him/her.",B1.2
"For long has smoking been a disputable social problem, and I think it's high time that we draw a conclusion and take action towards it. I agree to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country for the following reasons. First, smoking has nowadays become one of the most serious pollutions. In China, about 3/4 of population is found out to be the victim of second-hand smoke. And when we find out that the rest 1/4 is who that smokes, we have to acknowledge the dangerous situation we are faced with, that is, there is the toxic gas form cigarettes in every home. Can we just stand here and see this going on? No! Second, public places can be easily polluted by smoke. So it's reasonable that we first take step to protect these places form smoke. We eat in restaurant everyday, and we definitely don't want the disgusting smoke to ruin our appetite while enjoying the delicious food. Think about it, you step into a restaurant and expect to enjoy a good meal but only to find the whole room filled with smokes, what a bad day! Last but not least, kids are most easily to be harmed by smokes. Will you want you child to be exposed to the toxic gases? So let's take action and make our world a better place!",B2
"I agree with the point. Nowadays, there is a hot discussion about whether smoking should be banned all the restaurants. People who smoke argue that it takes away their freedom. However nonsmokers advocate it is a good rule. From my perspective, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Firstly, smoking which will bring many diseases does harm to our health. Besides, smoking gives much gas off into air, which pollutes our environment. What' more, many people cannot put up with the smoking gas, which makes them sick. It is not surprising that smoking banned in all restaurants will promote workers efficiency. Therefore, it is very important and necessary to us to ban smoking in all restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he can smoking in private. My suggestion is that they should give up smoking. It is beneficial to both our health and environment. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Only in this way can we breathe more flesh air in the future!Today more and more people all over the world want to give up smoking. If you're not a smoker, don't start. In fact, smoking is a bad habit, which has great harm to people's health.",B2
"Restaurants are always supposed to be a place that people can completely enjoy their meals, relaxing their feelings. But let us assume the situation that when you are eating the delicious food. Suddenly, there a man breathes out with the smoke, so you may not want to sit here anymore. Smoking can bother others, and should be completely banned at all the restaurants. China has a large number of smokers. As nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon, they hold the view that smoking should be banned. They complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in public that would greatly harm to their health. As all of us known, smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. And diseases caused by the second-hand smoke are even more serious. Nonsmokers shouldn't be responsible for it, while the smokers should think about more for others. Banning the smoking in the restaurant is to build a better atmosphere for nonsmokers, and also for the smokers, in order to have a good time to eat. It is a problem related to the ethic, which means to consider more about the others' rights, not only thinking for you. Although, there is not a clear law to forbid the behavior, but it counts. It calls for all the people to do something to help!",B1.1
"Nowadays, most of the university students get a part-time job to earn money for their living, their family expenses, their spending on entertainment and so on. Some of them work in fast food shops and some of them work as a part-time tutor to help the primary school students. Most of the authorities claim that university students should concentrate on their studies more than having a part-time job. Is it important for university students to have a part-time job? After weighing both sides of the argument, I believe they should not have a part-time job. Some of my opinions will be demonstrated below. First of all, the government organizes different types of financial support to university students. Students need not to worry about the tuition fees. Furthermore, many charities raise fund for the poor students in the society. Therefore, they can apply for the support whether than having part-time job. It might also be noted that many students complain about the heavy workload on their studies. Actually, there are lots of assignments, projects and presentations on different subjects. I strongly believe that there is not enough time for the students to do them seriously. Therefore, part-time jobs definitely hinder their studies. Finally, Students should spend their time on doing community service such as doing volunteer work and joining some meaningful events organized by the universities. They should equip themselves to be a competitive person. In conclusion, there are many ways to solve the financial problems other than doing part-time job. For the reasons mentioned above, it is commonly believed that it is not that important for university students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because the experience to work and to get money with themselves may make the college students growing up. Angering their boss and missing their job may give them rich spirit. After they become the member of society, they will enjoy and leave wonderful achievement. If they don't have a part-time job when they are the college students, some of them will be worthless people. They don't know the society. They don't know that it's importance to get money with working. Of course, some of the college students who don't work know that important view. But, many of the college students may not know. I think. Other reason of the importance of a part-time job is simply. College students need much money. Whether they stay home with their family or not, they may want to enjoy the college life. It may be the play, study and love. Anyway, they need much money. So they must have a part-time job. Finally, I think, it is not only the college students but also society to want the college student to have a part-time job. The college students are the element of society, too. If none of them worked, society might not exist.",A2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. There are three reasons why I agree with the ban on smoking. First, my family and I don't smoke, so I smell the little flavor of cigarettes. And I don't like it very much. I think many people also don't like it. Moreover, because of the smell of cigarettes, we can't taste the meal at a restaurant and we can't eat delicious meal. So it is important to ban smoking at all restaurants. Secondly, there are smoking seats and nonsmoking seats at some restaurants. When nonsmoking seats are full and I don't want to wait, I may go to smoking seats. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, I may sit soon at nonsmoking seats. Finally, I think that if the place where we can smoke decrease, people who stop smoking increase. And we can live more comfortable than today. For example, we may not smell the flavor of cigarettes at a station or in the city. In addition to that, illnesses such as lung cancer decrease. Man say cigarettes do harm for health. Smoking has a bad effect not only on smoker but also on non-smoker.",A2
"Smoking is very common nowadays. You see smokers basically everywhere. And restaurants are no exception. We come to restaurants for one thingâ€”food. That is our main goal but not the only thing that matters. There are other factors such as the ambience, service, environment, etc. that adds to a great meal. Now if smoking's allowed in the restaurant's premises and cigarette smoke's everywhere, wouldn't you lose your appetite? Personally, I find cigarette smoke unpleasant. And having to unwillingly smell this foul stench would be aggravating. Most especially if you're in a restaurant trying to have a good meal but is ruined because of the smoke coming from another table. That's why smoking should be banned at all restaurants in our country. It may be hard to do that since there are lots of smokers in the Philippines but it is possible. Smokers have the right to smoke but non smokers also have their rights. The smoke from the cigarette is spread easily thus, non smokers are affected even if they don't want to. Our main purpose in going to a restaurant is to eat. If someone smokes in a restaurant, we will lose our appetite and most probably leave. Now smokers should respect that. There are places designated for smokers and that is where they should smoke and not in a public place where other non smokers can be affected.",B1.2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. By restaurants, I am referring to proper dining areas, and not places of entertainment like pubs. I would also like to extend the definition of restaurants to include non-air conditioned dining areas such as hawker centres. We are all aware of the harmful effects of third-party smoke, as well as the irritation it brings to non-smokers. Obviously, the negative effects far outweigh any marginal financial gains, if any, restaurant owners can possibly gain. Firstly, why is there a need for smoking areas to be established in dining areas anyway? Dining areas, as the name implies, are for dining. We cannot eat and smoke simultaneously. Even if someone is not dining in the restaurant, he could always excuse himself and go somewhere else for a puff. The urge to smoke can obviously be controlled. It is not as if he would suffer tremendously to take five minutes to go somewhere else to smoke. Furthermore, what is the use of a smoking area if the smoke can diffuse to non-smoking areas? Unless the area is totally blocked and cordoned off, it is totally useless to create such a space. However, the smoke will most likely affect the other diners, such as when people enter the smoking area, the smoke diffuses out. If it is far from the main dining area, then there is no need for the creation of it in the first place. Smokers may have the freedom to smoke, but non-smokers have their right to dine in a pleasant environment with clear air, especially since they are paying for it. Smokers can just smoke somewhere else, but diners have no other similar alternatives. ",B1.2
"Recently, whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country has become a heated topic. Though many people are strongly against it, I stand for it firmly. To begin with, there is no need to smoke at restaurant. A large amount of people smoke only to make them calm and keep their brain work efficiently, thus they have no excuse to smoke at a restaurant without any work to do. As for those who are addicted to cigarettes, it is absolutely possible to get rid of cigarette for a few moments. Furthermore, the non-smokers' rights should be protected. The second-hand smoking is greatly influenced us, especially in public places like restaurants. It's unfair to force non-smokers breathe the air polluted by cigarettes and suffer the pain brought by second-hand smoking. In addition, the ban on smoking at all the restaurants helps reduce the number of smokers. In China, people show respects by offering cigarettes to others and it's undeniable that a large amount of people learn how to smoke at the restaurant. The ban will decrease the number of smokers undoubtedly. To conclude, no easy solution can be at hand to solve the problem of smoking, but the ban on smoking at the restaurant might be the first step towards change in the right direction.",B1.2
"I from the Restaurant the tobacco am opposition about the people who blooms It says that even though the non-smoking and smoking when people does not understand It says even though smoking in restaurants, people smoking and two casual workers do not Even think smoking is a behavior. Smokers in smoke, but I think non-Smokers is position the smell is to let you know that it is suffering. Smoking is Free, but if the damage is, I think it's not free. It against smoking in the restaurant thinks its okay. In essence, the first time that secondhand smoke is formed and the elapsed time and distance Traveled by the nature and concentration is a mixture of dynamic change. Gaseous components of smoke Particles as the humidity changes and volatility changes its composition and size; indirect gaseous components of Smoke can be absorbed into the various material and concentration of particles deposited on various surfaces, Including the lungs and body, and diluted as in air Decreases. Because the dynamic nature of the specific quantitative Definition of secondhand smoke cannot make. Smoking only in designated areas must Smoking thinks. Restaurant in children, because the old person, Smoking is bad. Restaurant Is the Place rice spread smoke damage if people should not eat. Some smokers think twice at the restaurant, and people think their families would not want to smoke. I think only you know how to remain without citizenship wish.

"Some people may think that smoking is a behavior, symbolized as a mature person. Some people may think that when they are smoking, they can release their stress and heavy burden for a while. However, smoking is harmful to not only smokers' health but also others'. Therefore, it is actually not mature if you smoke in order to look mature. You do not care about your health. Besides, you do not care about the people around you. The real mature people will take care of themselves and others, because health is the pyramidal cornerstone of life. In addition, if you want to release yourself from tension and stress temporarily, you can chat with friends, see a movie, listen to music, have a journey and so on. There are lots of things can replace smoking. Since smoking can do nothing but do harm to everyone's health. Let's just quit it. It is hard to quit it, nevertheless, if you have been addicted to it for a long time. It is like the drug which makes you very uncomfortable when you do not take it. Worse yet, you may go crazy. At this moment, all you need to do is to keep your perseverance. As long as you stick to it and pass the most difficult time, you will win the better life.",B1.2

Above all, it is said that children are more likely to receive the harm, and there are many children in restaurants. There are a lot of harmful things we receive by smoking cigarette or breathing cigarette smoke from the cigarette which the person around us smokes. There are some people who don't like the smell of cigarettes. I don't like it, too. People go to a restaurant to enjoy eating dishes. I think people enjoy the smell of dishes, too. If a person smokes a cigarette in a restaurant, people who enjoy eating dishes around there couldn't enjoy the smell of dishes. Of course, there are many people who smoke cigarette. Such people would have troubles if smoking is banned at all restaurants. But there are many people who don't smoke cigarettes, too. I think people who want to smoke cigarettes have to smoke outside.",B1.1
"I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons and the first one is concerned with economic situation. That is, these days the college fee is very high in Korea, so there are some students who had to stop their study regardless of their intention. Of course, students can take a scholarship but it is available for a few students. Therefore, to cover their school fee, college students have to have a part-time job. In fact, many college students are doing a part-time job such as private tutoring and serving in the restaurant after school. The second reason is that although taking a part-time job looks like a kind of obligation, it can enrich students' life. As a college student, it is important to concentrate on their major and study. However, I think that experiencing diverse things is one of the college students' duties and taking a part time job can be one valuable experience. For example, if there is a college student who wants to be a teacher, he or she can consider whether the dream is right for him or her by doing private tutoring. On the other hand, although a student is doing a part time job that is not related with his or her dream, he or she can find what he or she really wants as doing it.",B2
"Are you one of the people who used to work part-time job? Why do you think to do it? Nowadays, there are a lot of people do it because they have a free time and want money. In my opinion, part-time job is important for college students who lack of money. Because, the university has many activities such as testing quiz, learning subjects, etc. It's necessary to use a lot of money for pay semester fee, university uniforms, cost in department, etc. Especially college students who come from different country, they have to pay more than other students whom live near university. They must rent the room in the apartment, condo, dorm, etc. or live with relative's house in order to go to the university comfortably. Some college students who come back home must pay fee every day. Moreover, cost of living is higher and semester fee is expensive. Part-time job can help them to earn more money. However, college students who work a part-time job will get more skills than other people. Part-time job can help improve their skills in working, habits and communication be better. Therefore, college students ought to do part-time job because it is good for people who want a new experience, new skills to work, earn more money and decrease burden family.",B1.1
" Many smokers have a misunderstanding that they are not harming other people's health while they are smoking. Many researches tell us that this kind of thoughts is absolutely wrong. Smokers are harming their own health as well as other person's that around him. If a person is smoking in a restaurant, he is destroying other customer's health. Once I come across with a piece of news, it said that a person that is addicted to smoking has a higher rate of getting cancer than normal people, while people that around the smoker has twice to three times higher rate of getting cancer than the smoker, unbelievable! If there are a lot of smokers in a restaurant, how many non-smokers will get harmed due to these smokers? It must be a large figure. Some smokers might be rich, but if you lose your health, any wealth will be useless. Maybe someone smokes because he is under great pressure, or he is desperate with his life, but those can't be a good reason to destroy other person's health. As we can see, a restaurant is a place which usually has a lot of people in it, so smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country for the sake of people's health.",B1.1
"Smoking is very dangerous to all visitors who were in a restaurant. Diners are reluctant to return to the restaurant because of the discomfort that is felt when eating there. I am against smoking in the future that I was not comfortable being in the same room with someone who smokes, especially when I was eating, such as there was someone who smokes a distance of 1metre from me, I choke and cough. It makes me lose appetite due to unhygienic food anymore. The restaurant owner could go bankrupt if their customers a little reluctant to come back to the restaurant just because of cigarette smoke. And, the authorities or government can give punishment to the owner of the restaurant, especially when it established new rules regarding the ban on smoking in public places. Risk of cigarette smoke causes or contributes to serious health problems. Cigarettes contain many harmful chemicals. Form of gas and hazardous substances which amounted to thousands. Examples: Tar, Nicotine, Carbon Monoxide. For human's body, these chemicals are dangerous or cause an increased risk of various diseases and disorders in the human respiratory tract, even death. Such as asthma, heart disease, lung cancer. Smoking as a waste of money. Nicotine in the human body or the effects of opiate addiction that triggers an increase in consumption. So consumers are encouraged to continue to look for or purchase. About cigarette price of about $1 per pack. And obviously it useless waste of money income just to buy the poison. Consumers must spend a minimum of $1/day. So, love the people around you when you smoke. Smoke on the places that have been provided, and distanced himself succumbing to smoke just better than forcing others to breathe your smoking.",B1.2
" Part-time job is a new kind of working method suited for those students who don't have enough time to take a full-time job. A part-time job can provide the students with the study and living expense they need as well as plentiful working experience. But it doesn't mean that everyone has a must to do a part-time job. It depends on one's situation. In my opinion, a student should know what he or she is doing and going to do in the whole life, and value the advantages and disadvantages when making decisions. If a student is having challenge in paying the tuition fee, doing a part-time job is a must. Otherwise he cannot continue his education. Well, if a student is not poor and he doesn't have a lot of pressure in study, he can have much spare time to manage. In this situation, doing a part-time job is still a good choice than playing computer games in dormitory. So part-time job is also good for the students who have a lot of spare time and don't want to be so relaxed, it can help students gain work experience and fasten their steps to the society. But if a student has to study a lot in college, he must treasure his time. It's unwise to do part-time job using the limited time and eventually interrupted the study. So, in conclusion, different cases should be analyzed independently. Part-time job is suitable for many people who face economic problems or have abundant spare time, but not for those who are busying furthering their studies.",B1.1
"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. To have a part-time job not only can make college life more colorful but also help ourselves when we find jobs in future. Besides to join activities and clubs hold by college to cultivate our interest positively, finding a part-time job is also a good way to make friends. Whether being a waiter or waitress in the restaurant or being a tutor to teach little students. Both of them can let us know new friends in different field and increase our social experience. Of course, the biggest advantage is that we can earn money after our hard work. And storing money we can buy what we want, and even go aboard! Though many college students don't have economic problems, I consider that if a college student, who never has a work experience, will be consider being a little strawberry. As if many adults usually think we are unable to stand any difficult things when challenge come! Moreover, because some parents are too spoiled there children and give them too much money to buy luxury item, leading these children don't know that earning money is not easy. In short, to prove we are not strawberries and being like an independent adult, finding a part-time job is very important.",B1.1
"I am agree with above topic. In this time, we often meet college students that use their leisure to work in cafÃ©, foodcourt, language school, and etc. Part time job becomes alternative way by college students to spend their leisure. It caused by some reason. First, they want to learn independent life and helps their parents with work, and collect some money to pay their tuition fee without aid from their parents. Even, they can give some money to their parents to buy daily needs for their family. They will feel proud by themselves, because he had felt tobe able handle their problem. The second reason is they want start their entrepreneur career becomes a waitress. And then, they will know the case that becomes to notice in run a business. Even, they can learn marketing technique, marketing tactic, and etc. Third reason is they want to try and improve their hard skill and soft skill talent. All of people must have hard skill and soft skill in any field that they run. If they only have hard skill without soft skill, or they only have soft skill without hard skill, they will eliminate from competition by people that have both of talent. So, they try to improved their hard skill and soft skill talent with part time job. On this way, their communication can be fluently, they can try to convince other people, they have a much relation, and this relation very important to work in company or become an entrepreneur. Anything their reasons, this experiences very helps them to prepare the future life. They will ready to defeat all of disturbance that happen in workplace. I am certain that the college students spend their leisure to have a part time job, they will become a success person.",B1.2
"The addiction to the cigarettes belongs to many people. And when it comes to the argument whether to forbid the smoking completely, the people can't make the same decision. Some agree when others are against. In my opinion, I think the cigarette should be forbidden. The cost of cigarette is a large burden,. Many people, including the poor man, spend thousands of money buying cigarette. It's a huge payment that most people can't afford. Maybe government can gain a lot from the trade. But in my mind, nothing can weight more than the better life of civilians. So the government abandon their small profit and forbid smoking immediately. Less smoking, less conflagration. In due time, every firing cigarette can burn down a town.. And most people won't put out their cigarettes, especially in the desert and forest, where there can have a fire easily. So influenced by the spread of no smoking, fireman's work won't be so busy anymore. Last and the most importantly, following the increasing of smokers' number, the amount of cancer patients also grow rapidly. Most lung cancer patients have several decade history of smoking. So for everybody who want to have a long and high-quality life it a must to give up your smoking habit. And if a smoker who had known that smoking can harm other people's health still stick to smoking, he may be too selfish. So considering the health of you and people around you, smokers should give up smoking. The three reason I listed above has explain my view. The policy forbidding smoking can benefits many people. So the government should put it into practice as soon as possible.",B1.1
"I disagree to the statement given in Topic A. College students have busy schedules that make it difficult for them to maintain a part-time job while pursuing their education. Apart from attending daily lessons, students have to juggle between completing assignments within deadlines and preparing for frequent tests. Having a part-time job will divert students' attention away from school work and reduces the time available for students to revise their work. Furthermore, students working part-time will suffer from fatigue from their work. Since the main priority of students should be focused on excelling in school work, having a part-time job is not important as it could adversely affect the academic performance of students in school. Nevertheless, some may argue that it is important for college students to have a part-time job to become more independent and mature individuals through handling the high levels of stress arising from balancing commitment between the part-time job and studies. However, one should note that college students can learn to be more independent and mature through their school commitments. Many students are actively involved in non-academic work in school that provides opportunities for them to grow as an individual. For instance, many students participate in activities organised by student clubs and societies. This allows students to widen their social circles, manage work-life balance and even assume leadership roles occasionally. Hence, it is not important for college students to have a part-time job given the busy schedules of students and their ability to achieve well-rounded development through other school activities.

"It is not important for college students to have part time jobs. (Is ""it is important for college students to have a part-time job"" grammatically suspect?) Many tout the advantages, or neccessity, of getting part time jobs while in college, for students need to learn the difficulty of earning their keep, or how to deal with workplace stresses and relationships, or how to become functional at a job in future. Students should get off their lazy arses and learn about the ""Real world"", one may say. Yet, by simply imploring students to take a part time job, more often than not, these students do not need them. Kids who need part time jobs just to pay their tuition or other life's neccessities will take part time work; kids who need to be told to get them, and how important they are to their personal development, really do not need to take these jobs. After all, the part time work offered to college students are often mind-numbing, soul-crushing work that adds very little except perhaps financially. Bussing, or waiting, or washing up and all these other menial work are simply jobs that are given to people who are unable to take up jobs elsewhere and need to pay the bills nonetheless. You learn very little except to feel bitter and tired. Kids who have the privilege to do without them should do without them. Instead, volunteer somewhere, or work at a craft, and really learn something. No one should feel it is important to take up part time work just to feel the burn. Feel the burn in your stomach to build yourself up to do something cool and life-changing out of college instead. ",B1.2
"The sentence 'Cigarette smoking is dangerous for the health ' has been told to everyone. It has been spread out using cigarette packs, commercials and posters, yet people still continue to do the act of smoking. Also, although scientists have proven that cigarettes contain tar, nicotine and other substances which make smokers addicted to them which in return cause lung cancer and other sicknesses, people still continue to smoke. People usually smoke in open areas, but there are also some who smoke inside enclosed areas such as restaurants. Despite the 'No Smoking ' signs inside restaurants, some smokers still smoke within the vicinity; they ignore the signs even though the signs were specifically put up to prohibit smokers from smoking inside the restaurant, especially when there are other customers eating their meals. I have once experienced eating inside a restaurant when a group of customers started smoking in front of the air conditioner. Never liking smokers, I was not only furious at the group of customers, but also at the manager and staff of the restaurant. I was infuriated at the group of customers because they were sitting in front on the 'No Smoking ' sign, yet they did not only choose to overlook the sign, but they also chose to disregard the emotions of other customers. As for the manager and staff, I was exasperated at them for they could have told the group to immediately stop smoking because the group was polluting the air while most were still eating and by their nonchalance of the group's decision to disregard the clear sign. To sum up, I believe that smoking should be prohibited inside restaurants, because the smoke does not only pollute the air which dirties the food, but it also causes lung cancers for smokers and inhalers of second hand smoke.",B1.2
"""A thin cylinder of finely cut tobacco rolled in paper for smoking"" is the meaning of cigarette from Oxford Dictionary. In the present a lot of people died from effect of it. It is a small thing but huge effect from your health. A lot of teenage started to smoke since high school because ""friend"" they think it is a cool thing but actually it slowly destroy your health in every way and every time Until the end of your life.

Many people think Cigarette is not effect for other people who didn't smoke it but do you know what? Actually secondhand smoke is very dangerous for health. Every year on May 31 is World no Tobacco day (WNTD) created by World Health Organization (WHO) since 1987 for abstinence from all forms of tobacco consumption across the globe. So if you are smoker stop smoking today before it too late. Although it hard to do but if you try harder and harder you will do it in someday. Just stop smoking for a good health!",B1.1
" There are many people who like smoking, even in the public places they will take a cigarette in hand. Cigarette make them feel comfortable, but to the others around them, it is not comfortable at all. So, I think smoking in public places should be forbidden. Smoking, in my opinion, is totally unhealthy, especially in public places. It will not influence the smoker's own health, but is also bad for the people around. The researches show that, taking the second-hand smoking can damage people's health nearly equal to smoking by oneself. So it is not considerable nor responsible to smoke in public places. At the same time, the smoke coming from a burning cigarette can have bad influence on the environment. Public places belong to all the people, it is impolite and irresponsible to do damage to the public places' environment. The smoke can pollute the air. The burning cigarette can easily cause a fire. So it is better not to smoke in public places. Just think about our environment before lighting up a cigarette. So, from all above, we can see that smoking in public places is a really bad habit. If people no more smoking in public places, the environment will become better and there may be less fire happening. So, I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places.",A2
"Smoking should be banned in all public places. A smoking has affect the health of others. The smoker lead to detrimental health condition are very much so present to society. Many people could die so stop smoking. The smoker may cause cancer. I think that we should not be smoking in public place because many people can cause from fume smoke. I never to smoke cigarettes because smoking is harmful for other people. Although the person who smokes also get the harmful, but the person who smells. Smoking a non- smoking, should there be a choice? Imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy a meal due to the cloud of smoke coming from neighbor's table. The fact that there was not a designated area for smokers has put the smoker and non- smoker in an uncomfortable situation. Smoking should be banned in public places because non- smoker have a night to clean air and because the cloud of smoking is more dangerous than actually smoking a cigarette. However, smoking should not be banned in public places because it is the smoker's choice to smoke just us it is the non- smokers choice not to smoke I think smoking should be banned in all public place is that is unpleasant to non- smoker.",B1.1
"Many people have reasons about that. Some of them to say yes and other people to say no. Each of them certainly have a reason why they say like that. They say yes because they think, that is important to make the college students get independent and they can help their parents. But some of them to say no. Because they think, if a college students get job so, that job will annoy concentrate their taks in the college. I'am a college student in one of famous university in Surabaya. I have reason myself. I think a college student to have a part time job is ok. But, they must be able to manage their time between lecture and job efficiently. If they can't do it so, I think they more better don't do it. Because that can unless for their self. Such as, they are over concentrate with their job and their task in college are forgot. And than, when they have problem with their lecture. They will be concentrate to repair with their tasks in the college and their job become forgot. That happen will be happened like thet again and again. Because they can't manage their time efficiently. So, the conclusion about that is important or no up to their how they can manage their time. If they feel important to have a part time job, they can get it. But if they can't do it so, they more better only to concentrate with their college.",B1.1
"Smoking, as we all know, is harmful to our health. Thousands of lung cancer deaths were caused by smoking and breathing in secondhand smoke. As a non-smoker, I cannot agree with more for banning smoking at all restaurants. The secondhand smoke can cause many innocence persons to death. Many cases show that not only the smoker, but also the secondhand smoker will be suffered from different kinds of diseases, e. g. Lung cancer and heart disease. Therefore, the restaurants, where we go very often, should ban the smoking to avoid innocence people breathing in the harmful smoke. Smoking be banned at all restaurants can show the support of the local government for non-smoking environment and for the sake of the health of its citizen. People will be more awareness about the harm of smoking if the government ban smoking and promote non-smoking life. The most important thing is that restaurants are places for people to gathering with families and friends. How can you enjoy a dinner with the forced secondhand smoke breath? It cannot help even if the restaurant has divided its area to smoking and non-smoking area. The smoke can still be circulated at the restaurant. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants to provide citizen a comfortable place for dining. Last but not least, smoking is not good for anyone. We should all support non-smoking environment and pursuit a healthy life.",B2
"Part time job plays an important role in college students' lives. There are a lot of reasons for getting a part time job. Some people need to earn money to support their family. Some people want to save money for their favorite clothes or notebooks. Some people just want to have such experiences to know what it is like after they graduate. However, no matter why you have a part time job and no matter what kind of job you have, all you need to do is to strike a perfect balance between your work and study. There are several examples that students work so hard that they forget they are still students. They go to work for 3-4 hours every day after school. They spend too much time on it to study any more. Surely, they are destined to be flunked and, to make matters worse, they cannot stay in college. However, it is not worth earning money instead of studying hard in their age. If they study hard and have sufficient knowledge, they are naturally well-prepared to get a better full-time job rather than a part-time job which offer little money. They need to study harder for their better future. To conclude, although students are encouraged to have a part-time job, because they can learn what are not in textbook and be more mature, they need to manage their time well.",B1.2
"It has been lots of controversy about whether a University student should concentrated in academic or to have a part-time job for some income or gain experience. For my opinion, they are both extremely essential for our future career and hence that's why I always support students to do some part-time job before graduation. According to the survey, many employers in HK point out the main problem of fresh-graduate are they lack with the working experience and communication skill with stranger or client. The merits mentioned above could be developed by having some part time job'effectively'. It is well known that the University has already set up a platform to provide many resources for student, like the summer internship at HK or oversea. So that student should treasure their valuable time in summer break and winter break to equip their own for future. However, I definitely discourage students to do part time job during the studying period, it should be noticed that the first priority for them is to seek for the knowledge but not wasting most of their time to gain a limited amount of money, especially those wasted their salary on the meaningless entertainment! Apart from studying and working, student should also widen their social networking in University by participate the extra curriculum activities. Work hard, Play hard!",B1.1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for three reasons. First, as you know, smoking is bad for your health. Even if you like smoking, you ought to reduce smoking. The law against smoking will be a chance for you to stop smoking during meals. Second, many people have dishes in restaurants. Though some of them may like smoking too, but others don't like it. You may say that these days more and more restaurants separate between smoking seats and no smoking ones. But smoke widen throughout the floor. Moreover, you can do harm much heavily in case children are there. Both physically and mentally, children are more effective than adults. It may inhibit them from growing! And of course you can't easily make up for it. You will get many responsibilities by smoking in public. Third, smoking prevents you from tasting dishes. It's a pity that even though good chefs give you delicious plates, you wouldn't be able to feel anything special. It's also rude for the chefs. In the ends, by smoking you have a fun only for a second, and after that you will get many problems. I hear that many countries in the world have already banned smoking in public. They widely announce that smoking is a cause of many diseases. In Japan there are less strict against smoking now. But weather strict exist or not, you should stop smoking such places like restaurants where many people are.",B1.1
"I think the college students should have a part-time job because they can learn to work as one portion in society. For example, they will learn how difficult is it to earn money and will not spend money idly. I don't have a part-time job now. But I had worked at super market for one month. In spite of short time, I learned how to handle cash register, earn money, say greeting, behave to customers and etc. There may be an opinion that if the college students have time to work part-time, they should fill up more student life. But today we can have a part-time job if there is time just a little. So they can enjoy student life and have a part-time job. I think that it is better changing various part-time jobs than remaining one part-time job all the time because we can learn various things. For instance, we will find our good point and bad point and the work that fitted oneself. For these reason, the part-time job has many good points for the college students to grow up the adults. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are 3 reasons for that. First, they can earn money to enjoy their campus lives. Almost all the college students want to enjoy their campus life. But, without money, they couldn't enjoy happy things such as going to the theater, traveling abroad, doing outdoor activity and so on. What is worse, without money, they couldn't continue cultural life as a human being! (having meals, washing clothes and so on) They also lose chances to experience various kinds of things which will benefit them when they become members of society. For example, a man who traveled abroad in his school days can easily make friends with people who come to Japan for business. Second, they can experience many jobs. A part-time job usually requires less responsibility than a full-time job. So, college students can go to various kinds of business communities and learn introduction to various kinds of jobs. In other words, they can acquire many skills with less responsibility in their school days. Through experiencing various jobs, they may find a suitable job. And if they the job, they can find new jobs thanks to the skills acquired in their school days! Third, they can learn the systems of society. For example, they can learn how money circulates or how to make good connection with people. These knowledge will be very useful when they become members of society.",B1.2
"Many people hate to smoke or smell the smoke, neither do I, because it may cause our health problems and other worse outcomes. If the majority of the public dislike the smoking behavior, the government should ban this kind of deed at all the restaurants in the country. Research has found that smoking do cause the health problem, such as cancer. As we know, people who smoke can do something bad to their health. However, people who do not smoke may be affected by those who smoke in the public by inhaling the smoke, and what's worse, the possibility of having a cancer is much higher than the smoking people. It is unfair to those who do not smoke. Besides, some people think that the smell of the smoke is pretty disgust, some even vomit once they smell it. If there is no ban to restrict smoking in the public, there might be more patient to be sent to the hospital. The most important of all, when we eat at the restaurant, we hope to have the clean air, soft atmosphere and the comfortable environment. If a guy smoke in such a place, the smell is bad, and it may pollute the air, and what's worse, it may cause the taste of food going wrong, further to affect the consumer's mood. From the points of view above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants, for the sake of the public health and the comfortable environment.",B1.1
"In Thai society, many people smoke at any areas. In some countries, there are some restaurants that they do not allow people to smoke because it is illegal. People are happy when they can smoke because it is their right to do like that. There are three reasons why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals including arsenic ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, benzene, and vinyl chloride. It is known to cause cancer, coronary heart disease, and respiratory problems. There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Second, I don't agree with smoking that completely banned because I think it is people's right to smoke in the public areas like restaurant. In some countries, governments ban this action because they think that it is impolite and harm others. Therefore, I don't want them to ban this behavior because it might violate against the UN Human right declaration. Third, wanting to ban smoking in public places isn't about taking away a smoker's rights. You will still have the right to smoke in your own space. The right to slowly and deliberately harm others was never yours to begin with.",B1.1
"Smoking? Well, I never understand of the person who enjoyed smoke. I know that they're smoke for some reason, but I actually can't understand them at all. Smoke have many bad thing to tell, for example, you have to spent a lot of money to buy cigarette and your healthy will get worse when you're smoking. I asked my friend why he's smoking and the answer is: It can make him calm. It can't make me clear with that reason! Well, I never smoke before and don't want to, so, maybe I can't understand them for the whole life of mine. When I saw someone is smoking, I will go to another place or make some distance with them. I don't like smoke from smoking. Smoke isn't only do bad thing to person that have it, but it also cause trouble to everybody next to you! I hope smoker think of this and care of us for a little. I know that every person have their own reason to do a thing. But sometimes, you should open your eyes and see the good and bad thing of what you do. I don't say that smoking is bad thing or good thing, every coin have two sides. Person who sees one side of the coin won't see another side. It's like the smoking. The one who smoke can understand the good point of smoke but person who doesn't smoke won't know. So, I think that we should understand smoker for the reason they're smoke so we can understand each other. Not everybody can do that. But I sure I'm the one who can't understand them at all!",B1.1
"Everybody hope to have a good healthy and have your life for long times. They would like to keep fit and strong your body such as the exercise, eating are vegetables or low sugar of food, some people control the meal of food and drinking pure water, milk and do not eating drinking anchohol or smoking. In the restaurant supporting to ""No smoking"". And there set the spare area must not smoking. As the same time the smoking killed many people around the world. Because it has cancer. (it's very dangerous of life). Anywhere are anti of the smoking in the School, College, University, Temple, hospital, Bus terminal, Department Store and Toilet etc. Many people to say yes! And banned smoking at all the restaurant and anywhere. They want to have a good healthy and good air. Althought, today's many teen-age boy want to smoking and they think is the old man, it's misunderstand for a long time. The workers are smoking, then they are serious from work and they want to relax time, it's good feeling. Finally, I agree with the content, because smoking is not good and bad healthy. We could set the area for a smoking for someone to do it. And balance the area to relax for everybody have good asmosphere more than support them. And then we have a pure air, good healthy and good place for enjoy activities with your family.",B1.1
"In recent years, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study. Should we put the blame on part-time jobs? Is it a good thing for college students to work part time? I think we need to think about this question carefully from different sides. It is true that excellent academic: qualifications are something essential if you want to find a good job after you leave school. But on the other hand, for those who can easily get high marks in examinations, it is worth trying to find something to do in their spare time. Then they can get some work experience which is as valuable as their academic achievement. From what I have said, it is difficult to judge whether taking part time jobs is good or bad. It depends on how you deal with the relationship between working and learning. If you can balance it well, you are sure to get enough knowledge as well as working experience, so as to get ready for you future success. So we can just say that doing part-time job can be good for some people and not so good for others. It just depends on your situations.",B1.1
"I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I believe that it would be quite beneficial for college students to work part-time, but it is not that important. There are many reasons why having a part-time job would be great. However, studies still come first. Tuition fees having been increasing over the years for college students. This financial burden can be lifted slightly with an income provided by a part-time job. Students will then not have to grapple with paying back their student loans, or even risk getting into huge debts with the interests before they can even find a job after they graduate. In Singapore, with a booming tuition industry, most students should be able to find tuition jobs that can allow them to earn some spare cash as they study and lighten their financial burden. Also, in an ever more competitive world today, a part-time job would allow those college students to differentiate themselves from those who do not have. Their resumes would be of more substance. They are able to write down more work experience or skills learnt or even opportunities that students without part-time jobs are unable to obtain. These would allow that to stand out and separate themselves from the other graduates. Even with all these reasons, the main job of a college student is to study first. Without a good degree, everything else is useless. Hence, I would say that to find the right balance, to be able to manage your studies, that would be the important thing for a college student. ",B2
"College is a time for most students when their mind is at its most curious stage. They are entering a new phase of life and going to a place where they will be encountering new things. At college people make life long friends and to do this they share many of the same activities, such as swimming class or chemistry experiments or even creating a new light bulb. To work a part time job would take the student away from these activities which they have already paid for. The students should spend most of their time on campus; college is not just getting a degree and moving on. It is a period in a person's life that should be cherished. If a student is always going to their part time job they will miss the social ideas of college will only be able to attend classes. Being able to communicate socially as well as understanding the academics is an important stage when attending college. I feel students should live in the dormitory and take part in activities offered by the school. This is a time when the students will learn most by being exposed to group activities with their peers. Living together and sharing ideas by being part of the same dorm gives you a permanent bond for life. The student who goes to the part time job will be left behind because they won't be able to participate in many of the college activities offered by the dorm and social groups on campus. This is a time for awareness and creating new ideas. If a student is worried about getting to the part time job and doing work there it will take away from the main ideas of college life.",C2
"From childhood to adult, I have heard many things about smoking, such as, lung disease and so on. In contemporary world, we can see many No smoking signs in public places, such as in the bus, in the hospital and so on. However, there are still many smokers or smoke addicts. They will feel uncomfortable if they don't smoke. Whether smoking should be banned at the restaurant? The question has sparked an immediate debate. Some people argue that restaurant is also a social occasion. Many businessmen tend to talking about their business when they are at the dinner. It is unavoidable for them to smoke. Beside, smoking is a personal thing, and others don't have the right to interfere with them. However, quite a lot of person advocates that smoking should be banned at the restaurant. Now that restaurant is a public, smoking should be banned. If many people smoke in the restaurant without limit, the environment in the restaurant will become worse and worse so that people will not have a good motion to enjoy the delicious food. The restaurant should keep consistent with the hospital and bus. Personally, smoking should be banned. If the practice is formed, many people will follow it. Smoking is not only bad for smokers but also bad for the restaurant environment.",A2
" I support that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because it does harm to all the people. The reasons lie in several aspects. Smoking in the restaurant is very impolite because the restaurant is a public occasion; many people are eating there every day. If you smoke, it will have bad effects on others. People will hate you and think of you as enemy. To leave a good impression on others, don't smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant is harmful to others. Besides, it is also affect your health because smoking can result in many diseases, such as cancer. When my grandpa was young, he smoked very heavily. Gradually, his health was threatened. This year he died because of lung cancer. The effects of smoking on others are more terrible. To protect all people's health, don't smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant will impact the quality of air. If you smoke, the restaurant will be very dirty and nobody is willing to come. The restaurant will lose much money. Worse still, you will feel very uncomfortable. In a word, smoking in the restaurant should be banned. It is high time that we took actions.",B1.1
"Having a part-time job is important for university students. There are mainly three reasons. Students can obtain experience from having a part-time job. Most students need to work after they have graduated, and it will not be easy to work if they haven't had a job before since they have no experience. Having a part-time job is a straight-forward way for students to get some working experience. Most employers prefer students with working experience because these students can get used to the job faster. Having some part-time job experience will give students bonus when they are applying for a job. Students having a part-time job will treasure what they get from their parents. Before having a job, it is too abstract for students to understand that earning money is not easy. If a student has a job, he will know that working is not relaxing and he needs to work hard to earn money. Then he will know that his parents are not easy to earn a living and thus he will treasure what he gets from the parents. Students can earn money from part-time job. University students are adults, so they should no longer spend their parents' money. Having a part-time job is a way for them to earn what they need and they can release the heavy burden on their parents. From the above reasons, it is important for university students to have a part-time job.",B1.1
" Last year ago, New York declared a severe order about stop smoking in the world, people are banned smoke in public places, which include bars, restaurants, offices, auditorium, and so on. It's said that the order in order to protect services health. No matter who is protected, we know that smoking is harmful not only to the smokers but also to the people around. Especially at restaurants, if one person smoke, others may breathe in and eat (smoke may fall on food) smoke, so our lunges and stomach will be polluted, it's like that we do passive smoking two times. I think you can imagine the disadvantage that people smoke at restaurant. When you go restaurant with a smoker, and the smoker spit the smoke on food which is your favorite, what do you think then? In my opinion, I will suffer from lack of appetite. We may have a try to put ourselves in smokers' shoes, they may don't want to smoke at restaurant, but they usually can't control their craving for tobacco, and now we can help they stop the desire of smoking, it's not only protect our health, but also help smokers. In my view, everyone has the right to choose his/her own way of life, but one does not have the right to impose his way of life on other people. So smoking in public places should be banned.",B1.1
"Even though smoking has been a historical part of many cultures worldwide for many years, it is time for change. Long gone are the days when smoking should be seen as fashionable or cute because it no longer is, if it ever was at all. The medical evidence that has been gathered over the years has shown clearly that there is nothing cute about dying from smoking and I have never seen anyone with emphysema who looked fashionable to me. The jury has long been in on this one folks, it's time to cease and desist. There is nothing good that can be said about smoking at all, but we hear an awful lot of bad stuff. I am sure that if many of us were to think long and hard, we might recall somebody that we knew who had cancer, heart stroke or some other disease which they contracted from smoking and I don't believe that if we picture that person before their death or illness, that we would say that they looked fashionable or cute either. The tobacco companies continue to get richer while the people continue to get sicker. Time for a change and the time is now.",C2
"Some people don't realize the dangerous of smoking for health. They just enjoy their cigarette and don't care about other people. There are so many smokers in this country and they smoking everywhere, not only inside their house, but also outside the house, even in public places such as restaurants. Absolutely in restaurants, smoking should be banned. But in a public place outside, it is not a big problem, because you may just walk away if you do not enjoy smelling it or being around it. But when smokers smoke inside restaurant, that could disturb other people while eating. They also can contaminated with the cigar's smoke. In the opinion of scientists, people who breathe the smokes from other people are more having risks. People like this usually called passive smokers. In the restaurants, one smoker can cause many people breathe his smoke as passive smokers. That smoker can make many other people having risk for many serious diseases, such as lung cancer, impotency, etc. So smoking should banned in public places and the government must set out rules for every one not to smoke in public places including the restaurant.",B1.1
"I did not agree with college students have to do a part-time job because the main roles of them are studied hard and a little bit spent the time for their friends. However, part-time job can make money for the study but if they did not have time to review the lesson, they will do the score badly and effective in the long term about their future career. Many students have their reason of doing part-time job such as lacking of scholarship, spending a lot of money, lost for gambling, etc. but I think they should find another way to solve the problems instead of working part-time job that I will explain. First reason, lacking of scholarship, is the most problem that many people encounter. In the present, government has many scholarships for students that talented moreover students can loan the scholarships from government. Second reason, spending a lot of money, is depend on students that they can allocate their money well or bad. The last reason, lost for gambling, is very ridiculous because they have to solve the problem from the causes. In conclusion, I still confirm that part-time job did not appropriate for the students that they have to mainly study for their better things in the future.",B1.2
"""Smoking is injurious to health"" is a very well-known sentence written on wall boards and even on the cigarette box by the ministry of health. It is completely right. The smoke of a cigarette be bitter than poison. Many irreparable diseases may be occurring by smoking. some really very dangerous deceases like mouth and lungs cancer is very common in smokers. First the youngsters start it with their fellow company as a fashion or style' but soon the nicotine present in the smoke start acting with the lungs and nervous system of the body. the nervous system feels relax with it but lungs at diffected. the requirement for smoking increases as nervous system require it more and more' in the same way the lungs get defected and defected even it reaches to cancer. A part from these diseases the culture and atmosphere also get effected by it. you can see that in our culture smoking is not appreciated in common places such as railway station' bus stand' hospital so if a fellow smokes there it is against the attenuates. When the smoking goes to its stop then the requirement for nicotine and heroine also increases which lead to not anywhere but death. So we should avoid from such a bad habit which is not but the loss of money' time and even life.",B1.2
"In several counties, smoking has been banned from almost all indoor or enclosed areas. The government has also increased cigarette tax to try to reduce the number of smokers. Cigarette boxes are also printed with repulsive pictures of the diseases caused by prolonged and excessive smoking. Though, these measures do not seem to reduce the number of smokers much, at least the government is trying its best. Some other countries have also considered such measures and implemented them. I myself am disgusted by smoking. Though there is a smoker in my household, that did not influence me to be a smoker now. Smoking does not bring any good to our health or anyone around us. Smoking in restaurants may upset other non-smokers who are having a decent meal. And since restaurants are usually enclosed and air-conditioned, the smoke gets circulated around the room and the whole place would stench of smoke. Passive smokers actually inhale twice as much chemical as smokers themselves. The restaurants would usually have people of all ages eating there, children and the elderly who are more prone to respiratory diseases, after prolong exposure to cigarette smoke would be likely to develop respiratory symptoms. Also, allowing smoking in restaurants would also degrade a restaurant's reputation as when there is smoking, there would be cigarette ashes and they would tend to disperse everywhere and we cannot rule out that the smoker would dispose the cigarette properly. I would strongly suggest smoking to be banned at all restaurants so that we could have a'smokeless' meal.",B1.2
"The government stipulated that forbids in the dining room to smoke. The dining room is a public place. We must respect other people. The smoking has much harm. The smoking is not good to the body.

Smoking makes lung cancer. It is a Invisible murderer. I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. If you smoke in the restaurant, it affects everybody. At the same time, you maybe not allow enter this. My father is a smoker, but he can control himself. If he want to smoke, he can auto walk outside. He respects everybody. I think that the restaurant don't smoke is necessary. Our government is also making liggle. If you don't obey, maybe you punished. Don't be kidding, I am so serious.

"I also think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. First, college students need much money for parties or nomikai. Of course, college students have not to join these. But if they join nomikai, they will get something by talking with older college students. Then it will make their college life more meaningful and help them make more friends. In other word, college students need much money for making much more circumstance around them. Second, some college students live alone. They have to get money for eating or living. Of course, their parents may give them some money. But it usually runs short. So, it is important for them to have a part-time job. Also, some people go to college from far place. They need money for expensive fare or buying bike. If college students' having a part-time job were banned, they would not go to college. In brief, they have a part-time job for surviving or going to college. It is true that college students should study. But I think that college life is not only studying but also experiencing various things to live at society. That is why it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"In the world, millions of people are smoking. They smoke seriously not only at home but also in the public. When they meet difficulties, they will smoke a lot. When they have a lot worry, they will smoke. But I think it should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, restaurants are public places. When the smokers smoke in the restaurant, I think they don't consider others' feeling. Restaurant is a place to eat food. Everybody wants to have a good appreciate. But if there is someone who is smoking, I think we can't have a good time to enjoy our food. Secondly, smoking not only harms to smokers, but also harm to others. Smoking can cause than 1000 deaths of lung cancers. Second hand smoke affects women, children, and elderly people. Scientists also suggest people to smoke less or give up smoke. If smokers want to smoke, they must go out the restaurants or at home. Thirdly, a banned can help encourage smokers to give up smoke. If it isn't allowed to smoke in the restaurant, they can smoke less than usual. Also they can have a good time to enjoy their delicious food. Above all, I think smoke should be banned at the restaurant. Do this is not only good for smokers themselves, but also good for people who live near with them.",B1.1
"Smoking is a very bad habit. Today in our world very important in our society is of smoking. Due to smoking many bright student dull in their study. Smoking effects in our health. One half people in our country or in the world die due to smoking. A person who is smoking becomes wealky day by day. His health is very bad. If we see in our country every people is smoker. Reaturant in such a place where peoples comes every time. But when the man comes who is smoker. He creates the disterbence in the envoienment. The smell of smoking spread every where in the restaurant. Many peoples who are not smoker they feel unrael. At the end we should control the smoking we should servive the company of bad people. Government should those people who are involves in smoking to get hospitals and treated them and banneded advitizement who attracts the people. The every place where the smoking take placeGovernment should stop it. And the shopes who shell these types of things give the punishment. If we see in our country everywhere every peaceful place. In the university where children is study in the school, college until in the mosque(house of Allah) we should see the smokers. in our country a large amount of peoples are arrest in smoking.",B1.1
"Have you ever thought about indulging yourselves with a cigarette when you got the job done or when you wanted to take a break from your strained life? However, with the government around the world drawing up anti-smoking regulations, the room for these smokers to take one dwindles exponentially. In fact, when ever more reports and studies reveal the damages cigarettes can do to a human and the surroundings, the establishment of these bills seems imminent. Among all the places, restaurant is one location that may not be taken lightly. On most days, many people will visit a restaurant at least once. Given that second hand smoker has an even higher chance of contracting lethal diseases like lung cancer than smoker, would it be reasonable and responsible to allow smoking in restaurants? The situation I am going to talk about can be mirrored to many others. Whenever I and my family dine at a restaurant in China, we always try to look for tables that will have the least interactions with surrounding people because we simply want to avoid inhaling nicotine and tar along with the wonderful smell from our dishes. By having a little private space, it can make a huge difference to our dining experience. Before you ask me, ask yourself whether you want to be in a hazy environment with nicotine stint or in a visible environment with a pleasant smell.",B1.2
"Nowadays, college students are allowed to take part time jobs while studying. The type jobs are varies from shop clerk to cleaning services. Personally I think that these part time jobs are important to college students. As we can see, not everyone in this world is rich. The same applied to college students. Some of them can not their education fees and may need to have additional income source. One of those sources is by doing part time jobs. Part time jobs allow the college students to earn money without neglecting their studies. It is an effective solution for students with monetary problems Besides money, part time jobs also give work experience. When we are entering the world, experiences are a good asset for us. Those assets can be gained by doing part time jobs. For example: waiter. In some restaurant, we can see many part timer works as waiter. Those waiters can get communication experiences while they serve the customer. Part time jobs also can increase some essential skills. One of them is time management. Part timer must manage their time so their work schedules are not crashes with their college schedule. Also they must know when to take a break for learning and doing projects. This way they can learn how to manage their time effectively. Part time jobs can be helpful for college students. It can give additional income, experiences and building our skills. So I think it is important to have part time jobs.",B1.2
"Not only does smoking kills the person using it, but also the people who are inhaling the smoke. Second hand smoking is what they call it. If you never heard of that, it means that the smoke coming out of a cigarette is almost twice as poisonous and toxic compared to actually using it. Either you are a user or an inhaler it is still the same time. That is why as a person who doesn't smoke, I would like to push for a law to stop smoking in Restaurants around the country. Why is this so? Ever experience going inside a bar a restaurants where you can smell the smoke coming out of the smoking area? For me, this happened to me a lot of times already since I love eating in such kind of bar and grill restaurants. I know that that as a student, I don't have any right to implement this to all restaurants all over the country because there will always be a conflict of interest between the people who are supporting this campaign and the people producing cigarette and bar and restaurant owners. However isn't it that we are the ones killing our environment and ourselves? Doesn't the future generation deserve to see the beauty of our nature before it gets destroyed by pollution? My answer to that entire question is yes. We should start finding a solution for this problem of smoking. Even if my suggestion will not be recognized by those authority responsible, I am encouraging everyone who are using cigarettes to limit smoking in areas where there are a lot of people around him or her",B1.2
"I agree with this statement because having a part-time job will be good experience for college students. I think we can meet people who are various generations. Doing so, we can get a sense of values which we did not have till then. For example, they are manners and common sense. I think also we can experience various jobs. Besides, we get a skill and knowledge such as cooking, carrying, register, and so on. Some restaurants or bars give meals for a person who has a part-time job there. It is grateful for college students who are particularly living themselves. If we work and earn money ourselves, we learn the importance of money. It also becomes economical help. Besides, if there were enough money, we can spend more money on our favorite things. It changes our sense of money when we received money from our parents. The new sense of money makes us not to spend money wastefully. We can use money by our intention and responsibility. I think it is the last chance that we have a part-time job when we are college students. We can get the ability that we live ourselves before we go into the society. It is useful when we go into the society.",B1.1
"Smoking is the main cause of death. Research into the effect of smoking cigarettes report that one in two lifetime smokers will die from their habit. Half of these deaths will occur in middle age but it can prevent by stop smoking. Smoking is a risk factor for emphysema, heart attack and cancer such as cancer of the mouth, larynx, lung and pancreas. In pregnant woman, smoking increases the risk of abortion and low birth weight. Any worsening of smoking would further increase aging because of more wrinkles on the face. So there are many disadvantages of smoking that have a severe effect on human. Smoking has effects on all smokers; furthermore, it has effects on non-smokers who are near smokers too. Smoking on public land such as the restaurant will effect on many people. It is evident that smoking causes air pollution. Many chemicals are present in cigarettes, which are breathed out and then released in the air. And also have effect on people who breathes in. Recently, many countries are in a list of smoking bans for example, Finland, Indonesia and Switzerland that have banned smoking in enclosed public areas. So it is a great thing if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants.",B1.1
"Smoking is a very bad thing. Someone who smokes has to abstain from smoking as soon as possible, and others who do not smoke should keep their good habits. Smoking is undoubtedly harmful to our health; people who smoke or smell the smoke are included. First of all, the ingredients in the cigarettes, especially tobacco, are proved to be able to destroy our organs and the nerve system a lot. Second, the bad smell usually makes people feel sick and can't stand the smell. By the way, I don't smoke, and every time I smell the smoke, I feel disgusted, and get a strong headache for a long time. Moreover, smoke will also cause damage to the environment. Because of the reasons mentioned above, we should do something to relief such a bad situation, which all of us do not want it to be more serious. We should ask our kids to keep far away from smoking, and make posters or videos to make people know the terrible result of smoking. Also, we should set an organization and a system to help smoking people cut out smoking. I believe if we keep calling on the disadvantages of smoking, the number of smoking people reduces.",B1.1
"When I was young, I do not like smell of smoking. Because smell of smoking is not good. I did not know why people are smoking. But I go to the college I saw many people who is smoking. I do not like smell of smoking, but I am tried to understand smoker. Averter then I thinks that smoking is a one of the liking. Just like we drink coffee. However second-hand smoking is an incoming problem. We cannot ignore this problem. Therefore smoking is able to be allowed in designated area. Maybe smoker experience inconvenience because of this. But it is an important thing for people who are not smoking. However quitting smoking cigarettes is a best method. I know that quitting smoking cigarettes is not easy. But I want to recommend smoker to quit smoking cigarettes. Because it is harmless for people who is near smoker and quitting smoking cigarettes is good for smoker's health. Smoking makes diseases. There are many dangerous diseases. So it will be great that we find another way that our stress is relaxing. For example doing exercise or listening pop music is good. I hope that this method will be a good help.",B1.2
"When I met a person who knew long time ago, we had dinner together. It was so fun and food was fantastic before him smoke. He started to smoke. Then I couldn't concentrate his say, tasted delicious food. The ashes are into a soup, smoke is attack to me. It was my worst meal ever had. It's ok to smoke. But you don't smoke in restaurants. It smells so dizzy, feel like disgusting. I think smoking table in restaurants, is good for nothing. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking has a bad effect for other people. It is corroborated by science. If you want to smoke, you must go smoking area! It's legal thing. And please don't smoke in the road. It's so feel bad. I want to a fresh air. Not to mix a cigarette ash. Don't' think about yourself, think about other person. They suffer your indifference action. Smoking is not attractive. It is a poison that your body going to sick. I want to smoke banned all the restaurants. They do not smoke in restaurants, say no more. It's a manner for others, and then we are feeling good together.",B1.2
"Recently, many regulations about smoking are enforced. For instance, in some area if people walk with smoking, they are fined. This rule is wonderful for non-smokers! I'm 18 years old so I cannot smoke. But I don't want to smoke. Smoking hurt feelings. When you eat lunch with your friends, next customer is smoking. Then what do you think? Perhaps you think nasty, you do nothing but complain about the smoker with them. Eventually you spoil lunch time. What's more, smoking destroys our body. By smoking, our stomach is dirty. And compared with non-smokers, smokers are apt to get cancer. The death rate of smokers is also very high than non-smokers. That is to say, smokers want to die quickly. Smokers say that smoking is our pleasure. But I cannot understand their words. When I was 8 years old, I smoked once. It was too hard for me to smoke to end. What on earth is pleasure? Probably, there is no advantage to smoke. I hope that one day tobacco will be clear completely. It is the best means for the world. We want to get very clear air.",B1.1
"I agree with the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have the following reasons to support my view. Nowadays, some governments have completely banned smoking at all the restaurants. This is a good idea for people don't smoke though it is unfair to smokers. As far as I am concerned, I think this is a good rule. Firstly, smoking which leads to some diseases like lung cancer is harmful to our health. What is the worse, many people around the world died because of smoking. Besides, it is not surprising that smoking will pollute the environment by giving poisonous gas off into the air. When people smoke in the restaurants, of course, the air in the restaurants will be polluted by the cigarette smoke. Other people will feel very uncomfortable to eat there. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurants can increase waiters' working efficiency. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. What is more, some people who are allergic to smoking in the restaurants cannot bear with the gas, which makes them sicker. Smokers think it is unfair for them but smokers can smoke outside of the restaurants when they really want to smoke in the restaurants. So from all the disadvantages of smoking and good points of banning smoking in the restaurant, we should ban it from now on in the restaurants.",B1.1
" No matter how others think about smoking, I believe smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. Millions of people die from smoking each year. What is worse is that smoking not only ruins the smokers' own health, but also breaks the health of all the persons who stay with them. When a person smokes in the restaurant, the harmful gases will escape into others' lungs. For this reason, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country, even in the world. I even think all the public place should have no smoking at all, but it is too difficult to come true. Rome is not build in one day. We cannot hope that all the smokers are away from the cigarette in a few days, so we should do something to help the smokers before they stop smoking. We should allow smokers smoke in some place alone in all restaurants in our country, but they mustn't smoke once they are not in the smoking area. Smoking has no good for everyone, but there are so many persons smoking in the world. Their reasons are various, but there is only one result, which is not good. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country.",B1.1
"We do know that smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Every year, millions of people die of lung cancers due to smoking. Smoking is damaging people every day. Yet, smoking should not be banded completely at all the restaurants in China. My views are as follows. Things that exist must have values. In China's long history, smoking dates back to centuries ago. There must be reasons why so many people smoke. Smoking can make people have a good break after exhausting physical work. Also, many women say that they feel safe when they smoke. Artists say that they have flash ideas when they smoke. Writers also say they can not write down any word without smoking. Many people also have the habit of smoking during meals. If people can not drop the habit, why not produce cigarettes with higher qualities? It will be harmless of they don't breathe in the toxic nicotine. Smoking should be reduced but not banned completely. Many people say they can not do anything without cigarettes. Thus, it will not be a good idea to ban smoking. People who smoke during meals will feel that nothing is tasty if they are banned smoking. It would be better that we accept that fact and think of ways to solve the problem. In summary, banning smoking is not the only way to solve problems. Change an angle to think. Producing better and healthier cigarettes way be of vital importance.",B1.1
"I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. I'm a college student and I have a part-time job. Because my family financial situation is not well, I should make some money to pay my school expenses. Except making money, I got something else from working at part-time. First, I got the ability of dealing with different problems, because I had to face different customers who had different asks. Second, the more working experience you have the easier you get a job in the future. In my process of finding jobs, most bosses don't like to hire employees who have no experience. In my viewpoint, accumulating the working experience as possible as you can is good for you in the future. Different jobs can let you learn something that not be taught at school. Even there are so many advantages for having part-time job, students shouldn't be affected the school life by the part-time job. We should make the perfect balance between part-time jobs and school life. Giving consideration to these two things makes your college life colorful. After all, it's a good experience for you and you will learn much things form your job. Part-time job is important to me, to you. So, to find one and start new life.",B1.2
"I am for that students do part-time jobs, for they have many chances that they spend money for mainly friends, lovers, parents and so on. As a result, they face shortage of money. Doing part-time jobs has another meaning for them. It is having social experiences gotten by working in social places not in schools or at home. They will help students when they work anywhere after they graduate from their school. Until they have part-time job even if they fail, they may be allowed with smile. But there are something's financial in social places, so they cannot be allowed at all if they fail. Even if they are allowed, next is nothing. Following this, students come to have large responsibility. Furthermore, money gotten by working may tell them ""real"" way of spending money. Not receiving from parents but earning personally may also tell them ""interesting of working"".  Finally, by working outside of schools their relationship is more extended and in the place where they do part-time jobs, many things taught by ""pre-runner of life"" enrich their life in the future. For all, doing part-time jobs will be something's that teach students many, many things that are important when they go through variable things and have their life lively. So I am for this.",A2
"I think it is not that important for college students to have a part-time job. If a student has to earn money for himself, it is okay to have a part-time job. For example, if a student has to earn his tuition fee because his parents cannot afford it, then having a part-time job is inevitable. However, unless students have any reason to have a part-time job, I don't suggest or recommend them to work. In the first place, the most important task for college students is studying. If a student has a part-time job, he will spend his time working, which means he will lose his time to study. Having a part-time job is waste of time for students. Some people might say that having a part-time job gives students valuable experience that cannot be got from studying. It is not true, though. If students have a part-time job, they might lose more valuable opportunities that are helpful for them. If they don't spend their time on a part-time job, they can attend internships or social activities. It is better for college students to spend their time improving their capabilities by studying or attending other activities than having a part-time job.",B2
"I agree with smoking should be completely banner at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is the bad thing. But now a lot of people in the world are still do it. I think the reasons that cannot stop people to smoking are for example, in the family if the sons or daughters still saw his/her father smoking cigarette since they was young so they don't think that it was wrong, and now some of people who walk hard or maybe they would like to relax so they smoking immediately. Now smoking is just a fashion. Smoking no t only harm for smoker but also another people. Moreover smoking is cause the cancer which is the big problem now. So I think if the government has a project to banner at all the restaurants in the country it is extreamly good thing to do. Smokers don't have place to buy the cigarette so they cannot smoke. Another thing that government can do is to tell the people about disadvantages of cigarette. I think if everyone help together to banned smoking. This problem will disappear. Everythings cannot doing by oneself so if you don't know that your lover is died because smoking you must tell the person that you know to break with smoking.",B1.2
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have had a part-time job ever since I was in high school, and this has made me a much more mature and contributing member of society that some of my friends. In the modern world, it is very hard to grow up and there are no real marks of whether or not you are a full adult, but having a part-time job in college is one of the ways which you can demonstrate your responsibility and also make some cash which you can use as you want. For myself and many other girls, we like to shop a lot, and so it is good to have a continuous flow of income so that we're not cutting into our savings or we want to go have a little shopping spree with the girlfriends. This is not to say that boys do not do the same thing, but they might be a little bit better at controlling their bank accounts and so they do not have to worry about it as much. Also, we have to buy a lot of makeup and other things too maintain our appearances, and a lot of this stuff is not cheap. Many people might think these are some stupid reasons to have a part-time job, but to me they're perfectly good, and so I will use them to state unequivocally that most college students can have a part-time job.",C2
"Smoking is one of those human activities that, in a way different from alcohol, has the potential to do considerable harm to others. It is also a big nuisance to people who do not smoke. Compared to drinking alcohol, another activity whose regulation has demanded countless hours of legislators' time, smoking is a ""harmless"" activity, at least in the sense that smoking a cigarette or three does not lead to an increased risk having a traffic accident. Yet the well-documented negative effects of second-hand smoke can pose serious health risks over a prolonged period of time to even completely healthy people, not to mention people who have respiratory conditions such as asthma. While there are few situations where a non-smoker must be nearby someone is smoking, the restaurant is probably the most common. In a closed space with poor ventilation, which describes most restaurants, second-hand smoke has a way of spreading throughout the entire place. This is often true even when a restaurant has designated-smoking areas. The big problem here is the fact that, while there are places to have a smoke outside of restaurants, there are few places other than restaurants where one can sit down, relax and have a bite to eat, other than of course one's home. For people whom cigarette smoke dulls the flavor of their food or aggravates their allergies, eating at a restaurant where smoking is allowed becomes something unenjoyable, and may cause them to not ever come back. This is why many restaurant owners do not need to fear any lost business: while they may lose customers who are smokers, they will gain new customers who prefer a smoke-free environment. Restaurants owners will also not have to replace their yellowed wallpaper every year, worry about supplying and emptying out ashtrays, and make more efficient use of the space in their restaurant thanks to being able to allocate all of it to non-smoking.",C2
"Smoking is the habit in which the smoker take the smoke inside the body and then pushed outside the body. This process is done with the help of breathing. In this process the main subject are the cigarette, cigar, hooqa etc. cigar is used by the elite class people. Cigarette is used by middle class. Hooqa is basically the source for rural people. About this the people have different views. Some says that it is a good but some are against it. I am against smoking. Generally it is a bad habit. It the cause of many diseases, when smoke enters into lungs it cause lung cancer. If a smoker smoke 20 or 25 cigarette daily he will be affected with lung cancer in only in the time beside of 25 years. The lungs cancer is a fatal disease also. It can cause coughing. It cause the mouth cancer he faces the dislikings of the people. In cigarette smoke nicotine is present which is a addictive drug it damages the brain tissues. The people become its addictive due to many reasons. I had mentioned some reasons that some people smoke due to fashion as they see it in the movies that heroes are smoking. Some people become addict due to their bad company of friends. Some people smoke for just little enjoyment and thus become the part of their life. One of its biggest reasons is tension. It has many adverse affects like wastage of money, damages health. Disliking of people. It is reduced by taking good measures by the governments. By advertisements ban smoking ceminars by NGOs. We have to reduce it.",B1.1

" In my opinion, part-time work has become more and more necessary for college students in recent years. And it has been a trend to take on a part-time job for college students. As we all know, everyone wants his college life to be full of colors and part-time work is one of those important colors. College life should not only be about study and activities but also conclude chances to walk into our society. Of course, there is no doubt that part-time work is a precious opportunity to walk out the campus to learn more about our society for college students. Only by part-time work can they get more precious experience which will be useful for them to find jobs after graduating. Besides, for some students coming form poor families the earned money can help them complete their college study. Moreover they can prove themselves by doing part-time work very well and become much more confident so that there will be more passion for them to study, work and live. As a result, college life will also become more colorful. To sum up, it is necessary for college students to spend some spare time doing some part-time work instead of some meaningless things like computer games.",B1.1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Ultimately, restaurants are the place to offer food. They need to supply fresh food and clean hall to customer. Of course, people who visit a restaurant want to have dishes in pleasant surroundings. Imagine, when you are eating a delicious meal at a restaurant, smokers are smoking at the next table. Smoke is getting to spread in the air. You should be upset and lose your appetite. It is absolutely bad behavior to smoke in most of places where many people visit. Person who smokes in these areas lacks consideration for others and has no manner. They must know their fault and correct the deformed posture. A mature sense of citizenship helps to grow a high country level. However, it is better to prepare smoking sections for smokers in a lot of restaurant because smokers have a right to respect their liberty and personality. If smoking is prohibited in the restaurants by the law, lots of smokers cannot accept obediently. Anyway, I am sure that it is a serious social problem. We have to find out the best policy to satisfy both non-smokers and smokers.",B1.2
"If talking about smoking may be a specific person only to do it. I think only a few smoking some people may be women but the majority will be men over. In smoking and smoking are not considered dangerous to yourself and the people around you. Smoking is one of the drugs contain nicotine, a substance harmful to health. People who smoke would regardless of their location, sometimes even smoking signs, but they are still a violation, such as smoking in restaurants. Some people may think it is normal for the average person, but he in fact, smoking is the restaurant. Those in the restaurant, whether a woman. Men and children get to check smoke smell very different to cause disease but he will know that it hurt the people around him indirectly though they do not even smoke a little matter so therefore I think. We should work together campaigning for tobacco in restaurants and public places. Describes the harm that drug abuse is in cigarettes that cause disease properties and how. But I want the best for the university in collaboration with the government that the restaurant is next to no-smoking signs and punishment to those who fail to comply.",B1.1
"I agree with this opinion. I have some reason. First of all, we simply have to earn money. Also as a college student we need a lot of money such as school fee, train fee and so on that we need in school life in college. I think it is very high but it is important to try to pay such money because such expenditure is not for other person but for myself. Relying on only our parents from the beginning is not so good. Secondly we can experience a lot of things through our part-time jobs that we have not learned in school life. I also have been learned through a part-time job. When I entered the college I also began part-time job. At that time I was thinking that part-time job was very fun because there many kind of people and I can earn money easily. But I changed such thoughts now. I understood that earning money is very hard. Working is not the entertainment that we fun and is needed a lot of responsibilities. So we must separate work and daily life. Some people think it is common sense but it is very important things. I experienced many thought more than money through part-time job. So we should have a part-time job.",A2
"I think that although smoking is bad for not only smokers but also someone around smokers, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for several reasons. First, restaurants are the places where people can rest and so they are able to smoke in the restaurants. Second, these days smorking areas have been too separeted, for example, in planes, in work places, in the Shinkansen. So if restraurants have a smoking area, people can smoke in the smoking area. Third, smoking is a kind of drug. This means that smokers cannot help smoke a lot of times a day. So we have to allow to hold smokin areas in the restaurants. Fourth, I think smoking should be rather completely banned at all the streets in Japan than restaurants. This is because in the restaurants people who do not smoke and are not in smoking area are not annoyed by smokers in smoking area, and smoking in the streets is very dangerous. For example, someone behind the smoker cannot help breathe smoke which the smoker exhale, someone who pass by the smoker can hurt his or her hands, or his or her clothes can burn. So smoking in the streets should be banned completely.",B1.2
"Many years ago, the European has claimed smoking should be banned in the public places. This law considers smoker's health and the people who don't smoke and the place making. There is an argument about whether smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. In my opinion, it should be banned. Firstly, we are aware about how bad smoking is for our health. Smoking causes cancer, and heart disease. It can shorten your life by 10 years or more. So, smoking too much is bad for your health. You should consider your health. Secondly, in the restaurant, there are a lot of people. It affects the health of others. Second hand smoke contains hundreds of bad chemicals. This also causes their health problem like cancer. Non smoker should not suffer this unfair treatment. For secondhand smoke cause more danger than the smoker. Finally, smoker also spends large numbers of money. The money in smoking can be used in many useful ways. It can not be just used in such way. Indeed, I don't agree with people can smoke at the restaurant. In the public place, you have the right to smoke, but you should consider other's felling. If you can't quit smoking, you should find a place belongs to you for smoking. Please don't smoke at the restaurant.",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The first reason is that smoking is not good for health. It is one of the cause of lung cancer and many people die because of it. Every time you smoke a cigarette, you may harm other people's health too. Other people who breath in smoke may die because of lung cancer and other diseases. The second reason is smoking can be addictive. When you smoke a cigarette, you will want to smoke more and more. You may use all your money to buy cigarettes and have a financial problem. Another reason is that when you smoke cigarette or tobacco, other people will not want to be your friends. Everybody knows that smoking cause bad smell and other bad things. So, they not want to be with persons who smoke and avoid talking with them. The final reason is that smoking can cause bad smell in restaurants. All customer in restaurant will not enjoy their eating and will not come to that restaurant again. So an owner will get less money and have to close a restaurant. In conclusion, for these reasons, I believe that banning smoking is a good idea.",B1.2
"I think cigarettes are bad in the body. But I am smoking. I tried everything trying to stop smoking failed. Difficult and painful, when i want a cigarette. It became a habit. I can stop for a while there should be a cigarette. I know now i can stop the tobacco that it is not. When the trial period is rather more smoking. When it became the first smoking were 20 years old. I regret that time. If I do not smoke then I would not have a cigarette is not. Give up smoking during the supposed decline of the difficult, but it is not difficult at first. Those who do not smoke I do not want to recommend. Because Cigarettes do not help anything. Also need to stop smoking is because of the money disappears. And most importantly, your body is not good. Of people who smoke and cause other people to see the damage can be. This situation will be bled. People who do not smoke are harmful to having a bad action. I've been smoking four years, but I'm trying to quit smoking. To stop smoking, my body healthy and I save the money. I'll try to do so.",B1.1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as it entails many benefits. These benefits include vocational experience, financial independence, and practicing time management. Such benefits are useful immediately upon graduation and for the rest of their lives. Firstly, part-time jobs bring about vocational experience to prepare college students for the workforce, where they will experience how it is like to work in different environments. They will also gain technical skills and experience for the particular vocation they are working at, which could be useful in their future employment or personal lives. Secondly, a part-time job might allow college students to be financially independent to some extent, in which they support themselves through college using their earnings. Consequently, college students would also learn to manage their finances, as they would have to set aside money for their education, personal expenses, and savings. Even if their earnings are not enough to cover the cost of their education, it would allow them to repay their tuition loans earlier or offset more expenses. Thus, students need not be in debt after their education or being entirely reliant on financing. Lastly, part-time jobs would necessarily help a college student pick up time-management skills as they would have to juggle both their education and their job. This could be disruptive in the short term, but if the student is able to juggle both effectively, he or she would be much more productive, and less likely to be sidetracked by distractions common in college life. In conclusion, part-time jobs would be beneficial to college students in a myriad of ways, allowing them to pick up soft skills while financing themselves for the later part of their lives. ",B2
"As you might have guessed from my other response, my mother is very protective of me, so smoking has always been a taboo subject in my household. One time I even just had a stupid Marlboro hat, and she was mad at me for a long time simply for having something that was related to cigarettes. I think that there are just as many Japanese moms out there who are very protective like my own, and they hate to see the fact that smoking is allowed in restaurants because they know how bad it is for their children. Also, they do not want their children to get involved in an activity that might lead to worse things such as drinking and gambling or even hard drugs. Although I do not appreciate my mother is strict control of me, I realize that she has my best interests in mind, and if the Japanese mothers have the best interests of their children in mind as well, they should seek to make this a more discussed issue so that they can ban smoking in the restaurants very soon. I hope that if I am never lucky enough to go to Japan that I did not have to worry about whether are not the restaurants are smoky.",C2
"Smoking should be banned in all restaurant in the country. Smoking in restaurants could affect other customers in the restaurant. This could cause discomfort for other customers. Some people lose their appetite in eating when they smell smoke of the cigarette. Other customers do not like the smell of tobacco thus smoking in restaurants could cause minor or major conflicts between the customers. Restaurants are considered as a sign of elegance and class, if people would smoke in restaurants, it would tarnish the image of a respectable restaurant. It could also destroy the sanitation in the restaurant since the smell of the smoke is not pleasant to the human nose. Improper sanitation of restaurant could lead to the closing of the particular restaurant. Originally, restaurant s are not the proper place for smokers to consume their cigars since, since restaurants are places where people could dine properly. Smoking is not considered as dining. Cigarettes are not counted as food or a substitute for a meal. Smoking should be allowed only in certain places and the restaurants are not included in those places. Smoking may be considered a meal for other Filipinos but they should not be done on places such as restaurants.",B1.2
"I agree this essay. I agree that people can't smoke at all the restaurants in the country. Although smoking is only one thing, it is between all people who live on the earth. So it means this is not one person's thing. If you don't care your health, it is okay, you enjoy the feeling that taking a smoke after meal makes you feel happy and free like a fairy, it is okay, you can smoke alone. Because one person smokes that is bad for everyone. Everyone feels uncomfortable because of only you; you must feel guilty for those people you hurt. I also consider that smoking should be banned in a public place besides at all the restaurants in country. There are many disadvantages for smoking. For example, girls smoke that are not very charming, smoking causes bad breathe that influence other people around you, smoking can hurt your lung that causes your family and friends worry about you, and it also causes air pollution. If you have kids, they may hate you. Because you can't be a healthy father or mother by their side. Don't smoking in a public place, because you hurt your health and others. Don't smoking is the best for everything.",B1.1
"I disagree with this statement. Because I think that college students are coming to the college to study advanced things that they don't know yet or that they need in the future, so they have to concentrate on studying that they to do. I worry that the part-time jobs prevent them from studying at college. I think if they start to do part-time jobs, they need more and more time than when they are high school students. Then they probably eliminate the time to study or sleep to do part-time jobs. I also think to do part-time jobs is good for them from the view of being the members of the society. But as you know less sleeping tires them and makes them sleepy always, but if you are tough guy or girl, it means nothing. If you are sleepy during the lessons at the college, it means nothing to do study at college. I think if they want to study difficult and advanced things that they don't know yet, they need mach time and power to study hard and the time to sleep that keeps them well. In this way, I think to do part-time jobs is not so good for college students.",A2
Smoking is curse. It is a very bad habit. It averts the person from right to wrong. No one can make its habit by itself but the circumstances around compels that person it is well said a man is known by the company he keeps. Their all our related person which for us in which we one totally helpless at we have no other way rather than to obey. In this world of hustle bustle everyone is searching for his own demands.

Youngsters adopt this as a fashion when some students do smoking other will become inferiority complex that why we are not doing this. People do smoking just to get rid off from their sorrows sufferings and grief's when they are hesitated from this wordy world they feel so happy in their life. Drug addict persons have no care for their children family act. They are just beggars having no moral values. They and their children adopt begging as their job.

Institutions students must be fined so that they become afraid of doing smoking we should make our grounds smoke free zone so that our environment is full of happiness,B1.1
"Sit in the elegant and clean restaurant, listen to some soft music, enjoy your yummy food, but what about some smoke in addition? Absolutely it is terrible! Smoking may let eaters who don't take cigarette choke. Let alone its harm to their bodies. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And the reasons why smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants may be listed as followings. To begin with, smoking can disturb the harmonious atmosphere. Imagine, in some high-level restaurant, some people are happily enjoying their dinners. Suddenly they smell the fog of smokers from nearby, they will immediately feel uncomfortable and cover their nose and mouth. Sometimes, if there are babies sit close to smokers, it is more terrible. Now let's come to its harm. Regarding the adults, children or teenagers have to tolerate second-hand smoking. Many people already know that second-hand smoking is more harmful that smoking. Let alone to the children. And many restaurants are often filled with the young, so it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants for young people health. To sum up, it is harmful for consumers in the restaurants to suffer second-hand smoking. And smoking in the restaurants should be banned without any doubts.",B1.1
"Smoking should be banned in any public areas, surely including restaurants, considered all the potential damages to the health of the smokers and the people around them. At the same time, restaurants are supposed to provide a pleasant dinning atmosphere to their customers so that they can enjoy their meal without annoyed by the terrible smell. It is universally accepted that smoking can lead to severe damage to respiratory system of smokers and even people who smell the smoke. Restaurants are usually crowded with people so that it is not practical to separate smokers with non-smoking customers. Nor is it possible to prevent the diffusion of the cancer-caused smoke. Therefore, it will be a public health issue to pose laws to ban smoking in restaurants. Moreover, it is the government's responsibility to ensure that everyone has the rights to enjoy their meals in a smoke-free environment. One might argue that smokers should also have their freedom to decide when and where to smoke. However, when they smoke in public, others are deprived of the freedom to choose their dinning environment. They are forced to intake the smoke while they are eating. If you consider the fact, smoking in public is just like any other forms of crime, to satisfy one's needs in sacrifice of others' legitimate rights.",B2
"I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I am one of the students who do this. I can archive more experiences than my friends who haven't done. I think having a part- time job could give and improve your skill. I do many part- time job such as teaching, to look after children, car washing, volunteer, waiter, delivery man. I do this because these job will give the experience that have more valuable than salary. Teaching give me an communication skills and kind for hope your student to be better. To look after children give me How to control and know children?. Car washing give me about cleaning that is important for working in every type of work. To be a waiter give me about How to control your emotion? and service skill. These are my experience that I think it is valuable and good. Students can use this time to try to work, like to warm yourself before play a match. And the university may help the students to introduce the part-time job and support them to do. Finally the students will learn by their experience.",B1.1
"I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants for the very fundamental argument that smoking involuntarily affects third parties (non smokers) and that third parties should not be forced to accept these negative health effects in a venue like a restaurant. It is important to draw a clear distinction before we delve deeper into the said argument. We are not advocating a ban on smoking completely --- but a ban of smoking at all restaurants. This is a distinction that should be always kept in mind for detractors who advocate smoking. The purpose of a restaurant, arguably, is for consumption of food, and by extension, one may argue, deriving additional benefits on top of food, for instance, time spent with friends and family at a restaurant. That said, it is ludicrous for a smoker, to start lighting up his cigarette just because he ""needs' it and affect other diners, especially non smokers. We do not even need to analysis the negative effects of smoking to make my argument valid. By smoking at a restaurant, it is indirectly imposing an obligation to the diners to be passive smokers. To further illustrate my point, I will use the example of talking and shouting loudly at a restaurant. Similar to smoking, it violates the ""fundamental"" purpose of being at a restaurant and by shouting loudly, it is causing a disturbance (in terms of noise level) to other diners. Like smoking, it imposes an obligation for other diners to tolerate this noise in the midst of a meal and family bonding time. ",B1.2
"Smoking is something that has a lot of disadvantage, especially for our health. Its smoke damaged our important part of our body, which causes a serious disease like lung cancer. Other than that, to buy a cigarette they will need money, Smoking is also addictive, and for the first time try people will sure try it again because smoking makes them feel happy and relaxed. In a public place smokers must respect the others that not smoke, by not smoking near them and smoking outside the place. For example in restaurants, the customer target was a whole family that contains parents and children, also their purpose in a restaurant is to eat something or drink something. Talking about food, food must be hygiene to be served and the area must be free from pollution, so the customer will be satisfied with the environment and they can enjoy their food. If in a restaurant there are people who smoke some of the customer that not smokes will complain to the manager. Some restaurants have the special separated place for smokers and not, so the people who are not smokers can enjoy their meal without worrying to smell the smoke from the other table. But that didn't solve the problem a lot, smoke is a gas that can move freely in the room, so it will disturb other people in that restaurant. So it is important to completely ban to smoke at the restaurants. Because, smokers will disturb others who didn't smoke, they can't enjoy their food because they are not comfortable in the place full of smoke.",B1.2
"Almost all of my friends in college have part time jobs and so I think it is very important to have one too. By having a part-time job, I have the freedom of disposable income, and that allows me to go shopping or go out to eat with my friends whenever I want to. Although my parents pay for college, I do not think they should have to pay for all my day to day expenses and so I'm trying to do them a favor by supporting myself a little bit. Also, I really don't like the rich kids whose parents do everything for them and I think it is important for us to learn how to live and be responsible adults so that we can go out into the world one day and know how to take care of ourselves. There are plenty of ways to find a part-time job that doesn't get too much in the way of studying or hanging out with friends and you can also make many new friends if you have a part-time job. Finally, in some cases a part-time job can get you experience that you can use after you graduate. For these reasons I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.",C2
"I agree with the statement. I have two reasons. First, I think they can learn a part of society. Of course, they can't learn it completely. But, it is important to know society. When they graduate university, without knowing it, they will confuse. They may make mistakes from it. Second, they can get some skills. For example, skill of communication, expert or general knowledge. Perhaps, the knowledge which they get to have a part time job are influenced their future. Especially, I think skill of communication is very important. Of course, there is difference of skill of it. But, in our life, we can't live without communication. It is base of life. And, it is sure that the person who has high ability of it is liked. I tell you two reasons I agree with this statement until now. But, I want to except a case. We are university students. We passed the hard entrance examination to study something. If they can not study because of part time job, I don't agree this statement. Part time job is said arbeit by Japanese. I think this word arbeit come from German. The word is arbeiten. This word means work in English. But, when students use this word, it means study in English. So, the work of students are studying. We enter this university to study. From this reason, I think studying is first priority and part time job is second. Therefore, in this case, I disagree with it.",B1.1

"Smoking is a personal right of each person and each person also has the right to not feel the smoke or even the danger and the consequence of smoking. Smoking in public places should not be allowed. The main reason is to make people who not smoking feel uncomfortable, although smoking is basically not good for your health then smoking is prohibited. Many people still smoke in public places, especially in restaurants. The restaurant is a place where people need comfort and nutrition for the body, but when there are people smoking, then comfort is reduced and many potential illnesses who come into the body. A restaurant is not possible to make full rules banning smoking in because they also do not want to lose their potential customers, so it would be nice if every restaurant had a special place for smokers who are already addicted in smoking, so that consumers who do not smoke will not feel disturbed and feel comfortable in restaurants and consumers who are comfortable with smoke billowing smoke in special rooms. but still better if we all do not smoke because the smoke we could not get any advantage, which we can only losses.

" Smoking is harmful to your health. Smoking is harmful to health, smoking is not only harmful to smokers themselves, but only harmful to others who are not smoking, and second hand smoking is more dangerous.

But suddenly you smelled something bad, something is poisonous, you would find it destroy everything, like atmosphere and tasty cakes, not to speak of your happiness. As I have mentioned above, smoking can do harm to every person around the cigarette, even there was a few surveys said that the one who is not smoke but only smell it can be more dangerous. Smoking is one behavior that harms others but bring no profit to itself either. Public places like museums, swimming pools, cinemas and some big restaurants say that NO SMOKING, because there are too many people, and I think there is just not any reason for smokers smoking in public places especially in the restaurants, all kinds of restaurants. Eating is one of the most important things in human's life, and for that reason we should have our breakfast, lunch and supper with a good mood, we must forbid smokers smoking at our eating time.

Also part time job can be continued as students' carrier when students are not sure about their future and feel that their part time jobs seem good for their carrier.

"I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let's discuss the restaurant first. So what dose restaurant mean? A restaurant means some place where you have a meal. After a lot of tiring work, you must be tired and hungry. You enter a restaurant and you feel better. You take a seat and figure out what you are going to eat, full of happy minds. However, God plays a joke. A big man with a rude face, sitting next to you, smokes as if there is only himself in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the sick dirty cloud drives towards to you. I promise you will get bad emotions back as soon as you sniff it and you will never want to meet the big man again unless you are this kind of impolite people. If smoking can just disturb your minds without other harmful effect, we needn't take pains to ban it. What's worse, smoking is consuming your life. You can google smoking & bad effect and there is no doubt that you will receive millions of results that tells you the deadly effect of smoking. The main cause is lung cancer. When you smoke, the smoke which contains thousands of harmful things goes into your lung and destroys your body from lung to every place in your body. Just imagine that your cells, your tissues and even your heart are damaged by cigarettes you happily smoke. You are killing yourself!

It is the responsibility of parents to provide their children with every facilities of life which they require at that age. But in our society due to financial pressure, they are compelled to do jobs. As a result they fail and cannot show better result in their studies. Some of these students are very talented students.

But in my side, if students can do the part-time job and manage their time together, it is great. Student can find some new experience outside the class. They will face the trouble and solve it by using their skill that they have met before. Moreover they will have to meet another people. Contacting with people, student have to respect to talker and intelligent to talk and Sociability, student should know what talker think or feel to do the best with him/her. So, Speaking skills and social skills is very important. Student will improve their thinking from the job, they will not only think to spend their life but they also think about their life and think about the people that they love. They can do many things by relying on themselves. If students do the job before, students will know before what job that they can do best or what job that they like. Everything have more than one part if you decide to doing something you have to make sure that you can do it.",B1.2
"I have never been a smoker and I usually don't go to restaurants where I encounter cigarette smoke, so I have to admit that I honestly have not given much thought to this idea. My parents have told me that smoking used to be pretty common in restaurants, and they also told me that it was pretty terrible. If this is true, then I would have to say that the restaurants in Japan should ban smoking, because I'm sure that there are parents just like mine who feel the same way. Also, I do have a few friends who are smokers, and they don't seem to mind that they cannot smoke in restaurants too much. All they have to do is go outside, and often it is nice to get a nice breath of fresh air while you are out there, they say. I really do hope that they will not smoke forever, and I think that banning smoking in restaurants has made at least a little bit of progress in encouraging people to quit smoking. If more countries ban smoking in restaurants, more people will be able to quit smoking, and everyone will become more healthy. I guess that this is a pretty good goal for the next few years.",C2
"In favor of smoking in restaurants. But even as personal preferences and eating space, people just do not smoke tobacco, and taking harsh actions too still I think.

Smoking in public places and other people's non-gentlemanly behavior frowned upon I think we better refrain from acting. Smokers are not that bad.

I don't think smoking is bad, smoking in restaurants is a bad. Non-smoker is damaged by smoker because of secondhand-smoking. I see a secondhand-smoking is hurter than smoking in news. Smoking in restaurants, is an expose other people to disease. The target cans your family. Image one case, today is a family eat out. Your sun seat next to you. You start smoking, your sun breathe smoke. Your sun is non-smoker. Your sun what think about you? Maybe he feels shame. Because he has a conscience.

"Smoking is bad to our health. It causes lung cancer and other kind of sickness that we can get from smoking. Many cases also are also from smoking that at early age they are starting smoking and dying also early. We have this mentality also that if we know someone is smoking we are telling that this person's life is short because of how he abuses his body with smoking. Banning the smoking in all restaurants in the country may help one person refrain from smoking. The smoke of the cigarette affects also the people around the person smoking. It can cause also some sickness to the person who inhaled the smoke. Being banned in the restaurants can minimal these cases. Somehow, it also helps our environment healthier. It will make the ambiance inside the restaurant greater. It will encourage more customers to eat in a particular restaurant. It makes healthier place to be in and enjoying the stay without any bad smell of the smoke of the cigarette. I do agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country because I hate the smell of it and I know it's not good for me. I hope also that smoking should minimize in our country or maybe should be gone in our daily living so we can have a healthier life.",B1.2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I would term a part-time job to include flexible casual event based jobs as well as regular weekly paid activities. The two main benefits of having a part-time job is earning money and learning life skills. I believe that having a part-time job would help a student to be more independent, as he would not depend completely on his parents for allowance money. He would also learn to better appreciate the value of money and how one must put in effort to earn a living. With a part-time job, the student will also learn about responsibility and management of time and activities. He will need to learn to prioritize his time and be diligent in his school work in order to keep up his grades while holding on to a job. However, though it is important and recommended for a college student to have a part-time job for the moulding of character, it is not an absolute must for every student to do so, especially if he is unable to manage both school and his part-time job. In this case he would be biting more off than he can chew and the end result would be disastrous, with the student achieving mediocre results in both aspects of his life. Ultimately a college student must fulfill the basic requirement of completing college. In sum, having a part-time job would be encouraged if circumstances allow, as it would offer a holistic environment for the student to learn life skills that will help him transition better into an adult working life. The student however should be competent enough to juggle both activities and place school as a priority. ",B2
"I agree that it is important but for some students, it might not be in their best interest to wok while they are trying to study. Perhaps in their case, they may be finding it too challenging to work and their studies are suffering because of it. In this situation and if money is not the only motivating factor, they may be able to stop working at their part-time jobs and get caught up or in control of their study time again. Quite frankly though, I genuinely believe that nearly all students would gain more value from college by leaving all the outside influences behind and just direct their efforts towards college only activities and studies. It is unrealistic to insist that these kinds of students need to work or that it is important for them, because clearly it would be unsuitable in their case and would be causing them hardships that could quite possibly be avoided. While there are a few benefits that could be gained from working part-time as in the previous case scenario, the negatives I that case would outweigh any positive gains and therefore, would not always be appropriate or important for them. Which is not to say that it wouldn't always be good for others.",C2
"As a college student of Adamson University, I think having a part time job for college students is necessary especially to those who have problems financially, is also necessary to have an experience or to afford something you like in other words for additional expenses. Having a part time job is a hard thing do if you are a college student, its more hard if you're already have a profession or a permanent job, a part time job is just temporary because, first, it is just a part time and not permanent, second and last, part time job is to solve your problems financially. Here in Adamson University there are many college students having a part time job as a Student assistant in a given department to them, in my observation, being an Student assistant is very hard part time job because, there is pressure and they are irregular students because they must have a time to do their job, considering it as a hard work, at least they can manage it with pressure, of course, they are Adamsonians and they can do it properly and successfully.

"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country in terms of the health of the customers and the benefit of the restaurants. First, smoking has a bad effect on the customers both physically and mentally. Even if smoking area and non-smoking area are divided, smoke can invade into the non-smoking area. As a result, customers who are in non-smoking area end up with receiving the second hand smoke. It is said that the second hand smoking is more harmful for the health of a man than first hand smoke. In addition, the bad smell of the smoke makes non-smoking customers feel uncomfortable. In other words, smoking in restaurants harm customers in a both physical and mental way. Second, smoking does harm to the benefit of the restaurant. There are some people who are unwilling to go to the restaurants where smoking is allowed whether completely or partially. In fact, when I chose a restaurant, I try not to enter the restaurant which does not ban smoking completely. I know that some of my friend and family behave in the same way. As a result of this, in the case where a restaurant does not ban smoking completely, it gathers less customers than if it banned smoking. This leads to the less benefit of the restaurant. In conclusion, in order to avoid these two bad effects of smoking which I discussed here, restaurants should ban smoking completely.",B2

At present, there are many places have some people smoking both private places and public places such as restaurants. In fact, the restaurant is a public place. There are many people in restaurant so that, should not smoking because it is not only harm to smoker itself but harm to other people in close by smoker. Moreover, it is to conceive a dislike for another else In this result, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.

"Nowadays, there are many people like smoking, not only man but also woman. Some of them fell nice and relax by smoking and also can raise many ideas. But, in the fact, smoking isn't good for our healthy; it causes many risks, such as blindness, stroke, heart attacks, osteoporosis, and cancer. The risk is caused by the ingredients of cigarette. They really dangerous for our healthy. That's way, I agree if the government ban smoking in common area such as restaurant. There are many reasons for this opinion, first is to keep the nutrition and the sterilize of food in the restaurant, because the smoke of cigarette causes air pollution in the restaurant, so it make the air isn't comfortable and the customer will fell disappointed. The second reason is not all people like smoking. Then, the smoker must respect to the other who does not like smoking, because both of active smoker and passive smoker is worse effect of passive smoker. Passive smoker who only inhale of smoke cigarette. The third reason is to decrease the high level of risk smoking, because as we know smoking causes many risks and can shorten our life. In the fact, smoking is right of every one and it does not always have bad effect. Some of people said that they are smoking to raise an idea and exercise their brain in imagination or studying. More over, who is addicted by cigarette, of course he/she can't left smoking although at once or moment.

"I think smoking is a bad activity that can disturb our body and another people around the smoker. Peoples usually smoke after they eat food or drink a cup of coffee. It is the reason why restaurant didn't banned smoking at the restaurant. But, many people who not smoker banned smoking because it give disadvantage to their body as the passive smoker. In my opinion, I disagree with statement that Smoking should be completely banned at all, the restaurant in the country because it disadvantages the restaurant. The most disadvantages for the restaurant is decreases number of costumers because it decrease revenue of the restaurant and the restaurant can be closed. But, if the restaurants do not banned smoking, they also decrease revenue of the restaurant. So, the resolve of this problem is the restaurant must make smoking area and rule to the costumer. Smoking area is important because people who smoking can enjoy their cigarette and people who not smoking do not get the effect of the smoke from the cigarette. The restaurant not only make smoking area but also make a rule because if there is not a rule the smoking area not useful. It is a simple rule. If the smokers want to smoke after eat or drink something, they must choose smoke area.",B1.2
"There are no complete agreements among the students about the view about whether we should take part-time job. Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, also there are a lot of them having a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can make preparations for the job in the future. Second, they can get money on their own, cultivating their independence and skill. Finally, they can contract a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in the school. But the people who take the second view don't think so, they think it's not suit for students to do part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being worsted in the knowledge which they should gain in the school; they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. So it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try part-time jobs but not putting all the time and energy on it.",B1.1
Part time job for college student is not essential. But in some respect it may be essential. Some student whose parent is not able to educate them because they are poor. Some student parent had died. So they do job after college time. It is bad because in this way they do not give time to their study. Which cause failed in collage? College should have opportunity to give them money and to teach them free on the basis of their previous result and also give money to fulfil their needs for books and their person needs. For this purpose government should take step. They should make college in which student which are poor can study and also give them daily work. Or in the other hand after school time in the school or college they do some and Government give them rupees to fulfil their needs. Some student do part time fob to busy them salve they should not do so because it destroy their future. They should give attention to their study and get success. Some student do this to fulfil their outstanding desire which they do not fulfil with their pocket money it only waste their time if they do so the do not give attention to study and if they also give attention to study they weak physically.

" I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country. I would like to first say that this opinion is made with self-interest because personally, I'm a non-smoker who absolutely DO NOT enjoy inhaling second-hand smoke when I'm dining in a restaurant, neighbourhood coffee shop - or while I'm waiting for a bus at the bus stop. I'm very aware of the carcinogens present in cigarettes and second hand smoke --- which is why I agree that such a ban should be imposed in all restaurants in Singapore to prevent smokers from imposing negative externalities on others. Currently, the ban we have for neighbourhood coffee houses are extremely superficial because while sections of the dining area are designated as ""smoking corner"" --- diners would all agree that such corners do not exist because smoke DIFFUSES and an invisible boundary marked by a ""non-smoking"" sign has no part in preventing the stench of smoke from spreading throughout the dining area from the ""smoking"" corner. With the ban, majority of local and foreign diners alike would be able to enjoy healthy dining even in neighbourhood districts. That said, I believe more should be done besides the ban because even a complete ban of smoking in all restaurants in the country may not be enough to prevent people from breaking the law and smoke in local coffeeshops. Owners of restaurants may close an eye simply because they want to keep frequent customers. ",B1.2
"I think every college student should have a least one part-time job in his college life. Because with part-time jobs, you can accumulate your working experience. You won't be nervous when you are finding job or talking with the managers. Take my sister for example; she did part-time jobs when she was a college student. And she was willing to share her experiences on her motivation letter. Therefore she gets a job as soon as she was graduated. She knows how to deal with the problems and makes many friends in her company. Doing part-tine job can not only accumulate your experiences but also gain some money to keep ends meet. Moreover you can have a long-term plan in stock market. You are no more a student who just study and get good grades. You become a person who starts to design his own future and a person who can afford himself. But while you try to find a part-time job, remember, it's just "" part-time "" not "" full -time.

"Smoking in public areas and restaurants should be banned in Japan. I have lived here on and off for a few years and one thing that really irks me is inhaling other people's filthy cigarette smoke against my will. I think that it is about time that smoking in public places and restaurants in Japan was prohibited once and for all. I refuse to sit in a restaurant with smokers and eat a meal because the last thing I want to do is chew my food combined with the flavour of someone's leftover smoke fumes. It is bad enough when I am walking down the street behind someone smoking a cigarette. Unless the wind is blowing the opposite way, the smoke always blows back in my face and I try to hold my breath as I quickly walk past them. I realize that they have the right to smoke but what about my rights not to smoke or breathe it in when I am walking down a public street. My exhaling is not going to hurt them but when they smoke and exhale, it could very well kill me or cause me to get ill if it happens enough times.",C2
"A cigarette is regarded as a favorite food so smoking that is enjoying the favorite food is not illegal behavior. However, there have been many countries which ban smoking in public places. I' also think smoking in public places should be banned especially in the restaurants. I want to talk about the reasons in two aspects. First reason is that not being exposed to smoking is definitely one's right like the right to smoke for the smokers. If we have to make order on what should be preceded by among the two rights, I think it is the first not to be exposed to smoke. Therefore, people can enjoy their meal without smelling cigarette smoke in restaurants as well as other public places. Second reason is that smokers should not make harm on other people to enjoy their favorite food. There are other more important things such as others' health and feeling than smoking. So smoker should keep enough distance from non-smokers when smoking. I don't mean everyone should stop smoking in every place. What I mean is non-smokers' right should be first, not the smokers'. To keep non-smokers' right and health, I think there should be restrictions on smoking in some public places.",B1.2
"Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. This is as all along the government has been taking measures to ensure that more places in Singapore are banned from smoking. Furthermore, at restaurants, we have gas and other equipment to process or cook the food. If smoking is allowed at such places, the chances of fire or an explosion will be higher if there were to be careless management of a lit cigarette butt. As the patrons of the restaurant vary, it is likely to have non-smokers as well and it is harmful to these people as well if they were to inhale smoke as they eat at restaurants. Besides, most restaurants in Singapore nowadays are air-conditioned; the air when mixed with smoke may end up becoming stale and uncomfortable for the people in the restaurant. Thus, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned from restaurants. Even though this may result in the smokers going to other places or resorting to other measures to curb their addiction to nicotine, this measure is necessary to protect the non-smokers and give them the chance to prevent themselves from taking in second-hand smoke which is extremely detrimental to one's health.

"Smoking is not nearly as socially acceptable as it once was. In days gone by, most men smoked in Japan. These days, however, smoking is becoming less and less acceptable as the risks involved with smoking become better understood. As a result of this, there has been much pressure to curb the amount of smoke that pollutes the air in public places. I agree that smoking should be severely restricted in restaurants. The reason for this is the danger of secondhand smoke. Smoking does not just hurt the person who is smoking a cigarette; it also pollutes the air and is inhaled by people around the smoker. Studies have shown that secondhand smoke can cause cancer. Therefore, you can get cancer from the smoking of other people even if you do not smoke yourself. The upshot of this is that whenever you go out in public and people are smoking around you, you run the risk of being exposed to secondhand smoke and therefore potentially developing cancer later in life. Thus you should be able to go to restaurants without being exposed to this danger. There are other reasons that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. The smoky atmosphere in a restaurant that allows smoking can make people inside the restaurant stank of cigarette smoke even if they don't smoke themselves. Also, some people are allergic to cigarette smoke and would have a bad reaction if they were to be exposed to it. Therefore, I definitely think that smoking in restaurants in Japan should be banned. People should be able to go to whatever restaurant they desire without having to worry about being exposed to secondhand smoke that could cause cancer, ending up speaking of cigarette smoke, or being exposed to the risk of suffering from an allergic reaction. Because of all these reasons, smoking should be eliminated from public restaurants in the country.",C2
"It shouldn't just be banned in restaurants, Japan and every country in the world should ban smoking everywhere forever. I can't understand what people or governments must be thinking sometimes because cigarettes contain poison and when the are lit up, the fumes contain poison which is just being freely released into the air that I and everybody else has to breathe. There was a big court case in Canada a few years ago about a factory that was releasing poisonous gas into the air through one of their chimney stacks. It took three years and a lot of money before the courts decided to shut them down. Three years during which time, they were still doing the same thing, releasing toxins into the air. Smokers can do it and get away with it freely and easily and yet, what's the difference? It is all poison and it is killing us and those we love every year with nothing really being done about it except to introduce a few bans here and there. What a waste of time that is because if they cannot light up in a restaurant or library, then they just go outside and do it anyway. If governments and Japan too, really care about the environment and the people, then prohibit its use everywhere, just like drugs and let the smokers go through the pain of kicking their habits. Might help to teach them a lesson.",C2
"A part-time job is a good way for a student to learn many things that they simply cannot learn in a classroom. For example, by having a part-time job, I was able to learn about how to manage my own money and how to plan my finances for the entire month so that I know how much I need to make for rent and for food as well as for other expenses like entertainment. Also, I feel that I've become more responsible as a result of working part time because it has taught me how to manage my time and taught me how to prioritize my tasks in order to complete them in the most efficient way I can. This is a good skill that I simply did not develop well from college alone, so for students like me that need some extra ways in which to learn, part-time work is great because a can help you see the world from a new perspective and help you approach the same issues from different ways that will help you learn a skill that you needed to but couldn't previously. In conclusion, I think that having a part-time job is a great way for students to learn things that they may not have encountered if they stick only to studying for their classes.",C2
"The number of tobacco smokers around the world is continuously and rapidly growing. It is extremely disturbing and dismaying. Currently, there are about 1. 1 billion smokers worldwide. At this rate, that number is expected to increase to about 1. 6 billion in 2015. Nevertheless, around 6 million people may die each year worldwide because of tobacco smoking and diseases related to it. How can one fathom in preventing these increasing figures to smoke in restaurants? A smoke-free dining is very ideal and delightful. Majority of the customers will feel comfortable in this kind of dining. But the smoke ban can greatly positively and/or negatively affect the food businesses. It all depends to the customer. People, mostly non-smokers usually lose their appetite when they sniffed a cigarette smoke nearby. The smell of cigarette smoke is not only displeasing but also unhealthy for a non-smoker and asthmatics. It is called secondhand smoke, which can cause various diseases worse than a smoker may get. However, smokers typically like their alcohols matched with cigarettes or smoke every after meals. It is a bad habit that is too hard to break. With these odds, most restaurant owners decided to make a smoking and non-smoking sections but alas, it is not always effective because smoke travels through the wind and can break through the barrier of these sections. The smoke ban will not only be beneficial for non-smokers but also to smokers as well. It will be discouraging smokers to light cigarette for a few hours in a day. It will help them cut down or even quit smoking. Regardless of how essential it may seem, smoke ban in all restaurants and food establishments is regrettably impossible and majority acknowledges that but unity can surely make the impossible possible. Therefore, is everyone ready for this mission?",B1.2
"I strongly agree that smoking should completely be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, the restaurant is the place that family including the children have a meal. Smoking harms the health of non-smoker through cigarette smoke. It is especially harmful to children. It negatively influences the health of children and developing of children's body. Second, cigarette gives unpleasant and uncomfort to non-smokers. Because it is difficult to completely separate the areas of smoking and non-smoking, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Though separating the areas, cigarette smoke comes from non-smoking area. Therefore the right of smokers could not be respected so much, the right of non-smokers is more important than the right of smoker at all the restaurant. Some people think that the right of smokers should be respected. But respecting the right of smokers gives the non-smokers including the children negative effects. So, the right of smokers should be limited at all the restaurants. These reasons are why I strongly agree that smoking should completely be banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"Being a non-smoker, the natural stand would tend to deviate towards a complete ban of smoking. However, a significant proportion of our country's taxes are derived from the tobacco industry. Banning only bring about revenue loss and generates unhappiness within the affected population. Smoking should be not entirely banned at all the restaurants in Singapore, lest the smoking corner. An isolated room could be allocated to provide smokers with an alternative, besides, smokers tend to show less concern with inhaling second-hand smoke as they are doing it concurrently while smoking. We achieve both objectives of creating a smoke-free environment for the health-conscious and a bother-free environment for the smokers. The basis behind the suggestion is to induce social-awkwardness within the smokers, quitting must start from within. While it may seem like an unfriendly proposal, we must realize that these smokers possess the ability to control their habit and stand align being considerate in a social manner. Non-smokers have to bite the bullet and tolerate their smoker friends and counterparts. We do not ban smoking completely in lieu of preventing social unrest, but we strive to create a more considerate society. An entire ban would also result inconvenience for the smokers, they are limited to few eateries and this creates a double-edged sword situation. Restaurants will lose business, which is undesirable, a majority of Malays are smokers, picking up smoking from young. Muslim restaurants will fold up in a matter of months, smokers would be forced to take-away their food and soon be irked by this practice. While banning smoking is beneficial for the general health in Singapore, social unrest stemming from a single race could result in conflicts due to multi-racial unhappiness. Quitting is from within, not condemning. ",B2
"Smoking is a practice in which a substance, most commonly tobacco or cannabis, is burned and the smoke is tasted or inhaled. This is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use, as combustion releases the active substances in drugs such as nicotine and makes them available for absorption through the lungs. It can also be done as a part of rituals, to induce trances and spiritual enlightenment smoking is one of the most common forms of recreational drug use. Tobacco smoking is today by far the most popular form of smoking and is practiced by over one billion people in the majority of all human societies (citation needed). Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as hard narcotics, like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are often not commercially available. The effect of smoking on human health are serious and in many cases, deadly. There are approximately 4000 chemicals in cigarettes hundreds of which are toxic. The ingredients in cigarettes affect everything from the internal functioning of organs to the efficiency of the body's immune system. The effects of cigarette smoking are destructive and widespread",B1.2
"I totally agree with the idea of Topic B (Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. ) Let's see some reasons. First of all, there are lots of people who don't like the smell of smoking. For example, a month ago, I went to a restaurant where is near mountain, on one hand, I like the place because of the air around it, on the other hand, I saw a person who was smoking in the restaurant that makes me feel uncomfortable. I really hate the smell of smoking and when I smell it, I feel headache, so it was terrible dinner due to the person. Secondly, secondhand smoking is fatal for people's health. As you know secondhand smoking is much worse than smoking. Therefore, smoking in public place affects other people who are in public place as well as the smoker Thirdly, there is a possibility of a fire. In this case, many people who are in the public place are going to die. Fourthly, smoking in the public place makes young people or children have curiosity about it or want to smoke. That's why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B1.2
"Smoking has become one of the most embarrassing and expulsive habit and problem all over the world. People use smoking as fashion in parties which engulf other people also to maintain their so call status or standard. If it creeps into a society then it makes people corrupt. It slowly spreads a poison in the society. Smoking is not a good habit because it spread pollution in environment or most important that it creates many kinds of diseases in human body like heart problem, paralysis, lungs problems and many more. If a man smokes then other people which existing around him also effects and destroy their health. In short people should avoid such kind of habits which destroy their physique or health. People have to aware about its harmful effects so that they maintain their health more easily and properly. Most important proverb is that sound mind is always in a sound body so if a person wants to lead healthy, wealthy and wise life so he must avoid such kind of bad habits to fulfill their good goals or wishes of luxurious life. If a man wants to achieve his good destiny so he should to manage his right way to achieve his destination.",B1.2
"Now that both smoking and second-hand smoking are well known as the major cause of lung cancer, all the smokers should try to quit smoking. Many people hate a smell of the tobaccos, and the smell gets some people to feel terrible. A friend of mine in Nagoya also gets stomachache just to smell the smoke. In fact, the case of me, I don't get bad feeling by smelling the tobaccos and it's not that I hate smoking. To tell the truth, I like a smell of smoking very well. But much of my friends don't like it and I know the news of lung cancer, so I will not smoke again forever. Besides, I think, smoking interrupts. For example, when you have a dinner time surrounding good smells, the nice meal will be destroyed and we will feel as if the taste of good meals will drop down because of the smell. Of course I want to eat the dinner at a good environment for having meals. Exactly it's up to us whether to smoke or not, but we have the duty to provide other people with the comfortable environment. We never annoy someone. This thinking is close to the concept negative externality in economics. In other words, just because a smoker has the time to smoke tobaccos outside the restaurant, people having the dinner inside the restaurant get the nice meal and smoker have the chance to smoke openly. So utility of all the people will maximize. Therefore smoking should be banned inside the restaurants, but should not be outside the restaurants.",B1.1
"Part time job is form of employment that works hours per week or month. There are many sort of work. For example, serve in restaurant, tutor students, work in cafe and so forth. Trough part time job, you experience new thing and job that want to work. You can experience that can't feel at school. Also you can make money yourself as an allowance or school expenses. Many university students do part time job for their tuition fees. I worked in pizzamaru 1 year ago. I worked 11 hours on weekends. I made pizza and worked in counter. I had to stand all day. Making pizza was difficult to me. I worked in cafe. I took an order and made coffee. It was easier than pizzamaru. I also worked in Amor pacific. In here, I packaged the products like shampoo, toothpaste and cosmetics and so on. I worked in 8 hours a day. I stood all day and took a break 15 minutes every 3 hours. I was really tired. I felt that making money is very hard and doing service industry is very stressful. I think part time job is should try for your experience. You have to experience more than once.",B1.1
"For a great variety of reasons, it is very important for college students to hold a part-time job while they complete their degrees. First, a part-time job can teach them how to be responsible, and they can also learn to work is just one small piece of a larger organization. Too many American youths do not seem to have any sense of punctuality and seem to come and go as they please. This is not such a big deal in high school or in their private lives, but when it comes time to find a fulltime job after graduation, it is very important to be punctual and be on time especially in meetings and other situations where other people are depending upon you to be there. Next, it has become apparent to me since my daughter was born that young kids and especially teenagers do not really understand the value of money or the meaning of a hard day of work. When they want something, they simply ask their parents for money, and most parents do not know how to say no. This leads to spoiled kids who will have a very difficult time adapting to the business world. Therefore, for these reasons and many more, having a part-time job can provide many benefits to the average college student.",C2
"In fact, there are many college schools in our country, even some campus are very famous over in China, over the world. It just has a famous name; some schools acquire students to hand on lots of money. As we all know that not all of our families have enough money to pay for our education, including me. So, in my eyes, it is important for us to have a part-time job, especially on campus. Study is the most important thing for us in today's society, and we should put it in the first place. But who think about it that when we have dinners every day, what support us. --the money. What I say is mainly about economic. For example, when we finish our homework or some activities in Students Union at weekends then we can find a part-time job in the school or around our own campus. And this not affects our studies at first. Just look back, when we have the money which we earn by ourselves, we must be so excited at that time and proud of ourselves. In my point, on campus we should work hard and do the best about it. But on the other hand we also find a part-time job so that when we enter into the society we have enough experience to deal with it!",B1.1
"I agree to this opinion. Some people say that college students have to study more if they have a time to do a part-time job. Of course, it is true that there are some students who remain in the same grade by playing all the time with their earned money. However, there are three reasons for my opinion. First, having a part-time job tells them a real society. Most college students have had little time to enter in a society. By working, they have a chance to know how to communicate with customers, how to speak formally, and so on. That is a very valuable experience. Second, they know the importance of money. They have been brought up preciously by their family, and use their allowance freely. So, they must know how hard earn money by working themselves. They would thank for their parents to raise them until now. Finally, they can challenge various things. Although college students have much free time, most of them can't do what they want to because they don't have enough money. By getting a lot of money, for example, they can watch a baseball game, go abroad to see a different world, and so on. They could enjoy their college life very much. Therefore, college students should do a part-time job. That is useful for their future.",B1.1
"College students were beginning to learn when they finished high school. A lot of them were younger about 17-18 years old. Truly, every student want to come to the university or college where have a famous section for guarantee their talent and guarantee them self about a good work on the future but the problem is a cost learning of a university so expensive, and many Thai family not rich so, some students must finding a good job for work at the same time when they learning at the college. That is a good thing for college students shall to do because a job will give you a work experience and a different social. They will be a stronger and endurance with any trouble on the future when their education are successful. A benefit when a college students have work are the salary what is matter thing for alive in the college. Actually, the most important when college students are working is they should to purpose and carefully to their study and don't forget to practice. They must to find a time for prepare and alert with misunderstand subject. If someone can do like the previous suggestion. You will got a perfect life in the college and successful at the end.",A2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In addition, I want that smoking should be banned at university. I don't smoke, so I don't like smells of smoke. And I dislike that my clothes smell like smoke. My mother hates smoke too. My father used to smoke before I born, but she made him give up smoking. Because, smoke gives a bad influence to health. Since I heard that, I made up my mind to never smoke. Smoke courses cancer. Especially lung cancer, and more lots of cancer. If I smoke every day, I will die due to cancer. But it can be avoided very easily, all of thing that I have to do is never smoking. I have friends who smoke, and they say that smoking is very comfortable, how about smoking little? But, I always remember my mother's talk and I reject. Sometimes I become to want to smoke, such a time I think that talk. Smoking doesn't have a bad influence only smoking people. They influence others. I think that smoking person will be bad is of course. But I can't allow that not smoking person gets bad. I often see smoking people in university, and that smell is very bad. And the smoke hurt my health. So, I think smoking should be completely banned.",B1.1
"It is important for college student to have a part-time job. They can help onself and parents earn some money. They might do it when they have free time. They may make new friends when they work at place together. They may make new friends when they work together. The work experience receive in the part-time job. They shell apply in the future. Besides they may study innovation of work. The part-time job can help they care develop oneself and grow is a adult. It is student's fantastic. They can use free time benefit in the good way, and it can help they have some money income. They can save money for buy like something by no disturb parents. The make money at present is usually many people nave to do it because it is help us have factor everyday life. Many student in college think of be ashamed then no do it but student someone do it because have to sue to learn. They not be ashamed do it because not ashamed and do not people be in trouble. College students are period have power for study, work and to good do everything. So college student to have a past-time job are good job.",A2
"In the past few years, I've gone through a few part time jobs. I've been through the buy and sell business, the stocks industry and even the supermarket area. And In all of these jobs that I have underwent, I can conclude one fact: that it is necessary for college students to have a certain amount of experience in working. First of all, part time jobs serve as practice and preparation for the future job of a person. Simple part time jobs may seem unimportant, useless even, but in the eyes of a company, all types of these is important. Next, it gives experience to the college student. After college, people usually find jobs. And in those job interviews, there is always going to be that one question: ""How much experience do you have?"" As a requirement in future job interviews, one must have a certain amount of job experience for them to get hired. Thus, having part time jobs gives college students the opportunity to see the way adults work, and experience the hardships and problems they go through. Lastly, it gives college students the opportunity to learn. Learning in this case wouldn't simply be learning how to do a certain task, but also learning as an individual. Having part time jobs not only helps college students in their resume, it also helps them grow as people. No matter how little a person works, they always learn that there is room for improving themselves as individuals. Overall, we can say that it is important for college students to find part time jobs because it helps them learn, gives them experience and helps them prepare for the real world in the future.",B1.2
"Now a day, we can see many adults are smoking in the streets, houses, restaurants and bars etc. even teenagers too. Teenagers learn to smoke because of the influenced of their friends. All we know that Smoking is a bad habit that can harm your health and will lead you to addiction. There are effects when your smoking: Lung cancer, Asthma and can cause many other cancers and illnesses because cigarettes contain chemicals and toxic substances that are harmful to the body. For me, Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because it is not advisable to smoke inside the restaurant, it can harm the health of the customers inside the restaurants because even if you're not smoking and you are prone to smoke once you inhale it the smoke can damage your respiratory system is what they call the secondhand smokers. Most especially for the children their respiratory system is weak so they can easily be affected by the smoke and can cause them to death. By this, it can lessen the people who are affected by the smoke of the cigarettes and there will be a lesser number of deaths and who have lung cancer. So the Customer can eat well and enjoy inside the restaurant. They will be comforted.",B1.2
"I don't support the idea of banning smoking completely in all the restaurants. Though I think it's necessary to set up some bans to limit the smokers properly. We all know that smoking is bad for health, not only for the smokers themselves, but also the innocent second-hand smokers, like me. For the health of us, the smokers should consider the non-smokers. And in return, should non-smokers also think for the smokers? If on some conditions, their smoking does not affect us much, why must we set up so inflexible bans. For example, not all the restaurants are crowded in all the time. Maybe sometimes, restricting people by moral is more efficiency and comprehensive than the law. I think smoking is a generation problem, and we can not carry the smoking bans too far and too widely. To some degree, smokers also have the right to smoke, isn't it? Maybe some of us are addicted to the computer games. I think what computers to us are what cigarettes to smokers. It's not hard to imagine how difficult it is to control smoking, let alone throwing it completely. My father is a smoker, too. And for my health, when being with me, he never smokes. Sometimes, when he really wants to smoke, he will go to a corner to smoke. All in all, I don't agree the idea to ban smokers smoking in all the restaurants.",A2
" Everybody needs a job, and someone need job. But what about having a part job? When we in university, did we need to and should have a part job My idea about this question is that it has to be decided after clearly know oneself. As we all know each people is different from others. Firstly, our dreams are different. Some examples, some want to be a normal worker, and some want to be a scientist. Secondly our experience is also different, some have known our society a lot, but some have not known our world will; some can communicate with others easily, but some can not. So we have to make our own decisions. Maybe someone around you has a good reason to get or not to do a part job, but you had better to think about yourself after know yourself really. On the other hand, we must know what a part job can bring to us. A part job can give you a place to work, can bring you some money. It also can let you have a good chance to improve your skill. And we also have to get an opinion that a part job would do harm to you at the same time. Having a part job, you would have less time to study, to play basketball, to read the books you like and you want to read and so on. To have a good knowledge of yourself and what you meet with is very important. A part job is a just a part job, do not let it bore you. And you only make your own decision. you should and have to do what you like.",A2
"I smoke, but I didn't really see the point in forcing the regulations on restaurants, which had smoking sections. Before I was a smoker, the smoking sections of restaurants were never an intrusion for me. And I was born with sensitive lungs, since my mother smoked during her pregnancy with me. Anyway, I don't like the regulations, but I could understand someone with worse problems than I have being affected worse, even if they're in the same room as smoke. So that's something to think about. But I do have a lot of friends who are waitresses, and they all agree that the regulations have caused a drop in their restaurants' business. And I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the government telling a business owner whether or not smoking can be permitted in their establishment. We have one guy here, who owns a pool hall, and he lets you smoke inside as long as you put a donation in the tip jar, to help him pay off the fines. Otherwise, I'm always doing my best to keep my smoke away from strangers. When I see children approaching the door to wherever I am, during my smoke breaks, I immediately hold my cigarettes away from them, and I don't take another drag until they're gone.",B1.1
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Universities have raised steadily the tuition. Some parents can no longer afford the fee. So. Students are working part-time to earn his pocket money. I think that the part-time job will be an invaluable experience before social life. And many college students are working for his school expenses. Students work several part-time a day. They work mostly at a convenience store and restaurant and cafe and parcel service. They work hard, and don't earn much. Because student receive unfair treatment to reason young. It cannot be justified any reason. They combine study and part-time. It's not easy to combining. I'm done it before. I'm too tired physically and emotionally. The part-time job demand too much time. Students sleep to catch up on his sleep in the class. So, students have become indifference from study. Part-time job is important to them. We are no telling that quit the part-time. Because par-time is maintain their existence. So, university should arrange ways that scholarship system increase etc. They have to help practically to students suffering from financial hardship. Therefore I consent that it is significant for university students to have a part-time job.",A2
"Part time job majority students will be to work. Someone to work for to look experience someone to work because with to look add revenue besides thing the parent. But someone to work for to self support because the position poor and can target to finish. In society of Thailand. There are many students must do part time job that occur several reason to do work. Why students must do part time job. First of all, For some student is poor status. They are usually borrow money from government to study that not enough money to study. So, students should do part time job. Second, they may be very experience from real job that teaching a lot. Such as, attempt, anger, honest and endure. It doesn't same study in the class room. Third, want money to buy books and food or something. Finally, they are use free time to be useful. This is very important reason because use free time for job better than shopping with their friend. Some people can thinking and understandable are most important. In my opinion student do part time job that is a good opportunity and most correct because part time job have useful a lot.",A2
"There is a phenomenon that college students often take part-time jobs. In my opinion, it is advised and necessary for college students to do part-time jobs. First and foremost, everyone have to start to go to work sooner or later. By doing part-time jobs, we can learn how to deal with relationships among colleagues, how to handle tough tasks asked by the boss, how to keep good moods when meeting unfriendly customers. We are certain to grow up and know the society better through part-time jobs. In addition, many people think that studying is the only burden that students should bear. Doing part-time jobs will probably waste limited time and make scores drop down. I strongly disagree on this view. Sitting at a desk for several hours and keeping reading and writing can not guarantee high scores in every test. College students can walk out the classroom to breathe fresh air and have a relax during part-time jobs. Last but not least, college students can use the extra money they have earned, other than given by parents, to buy things and entertain happily with a sense of achievement. In a word, doing part-time jobs is really a good and necessary way for college students to study outside class and know the society better. Come on, try it know!",B1.2
" In the university, there is a phenomenon that a large number of students are looking for a part-time job. And there are different purposes. Some students are in favor in taking a part-time job. They believe it can add up their experience and open up their mind. Some object to having a part-time job. They think it has the bad effect on their study. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the latter. Two main reasons may account for it. For one thing, working more outside campus means studying less in school. As a English major, we need much time on our specialized knowledge. We should spend spare time in practicing oral English, reading, writing, listening and so on. It takes up much more time to take a part-time job, so we cannot promise enough time to study. For another, taking a part-time job distracts us from our study. Since some students have done a part-time job, they pay less attention on study; even they cannot concentrate on listening in class. Gradually, those students lost the interest in study. It costs a huge price of neglecting study. In conclusion, having a part-time job has the downside on college students' study. Therefore we should focus on our study during the period of university; after all, we are students.",B1.1
"I agree this opinion. This is because, at first, smoking isn't good for our health. As we know well, smoking people can catch cancer of lung. Cancer is the most in the cause of death by disease. So, I think it's better not to smoke. Secondary, like restaurant, smoking is annoying to me. Especially, the smog of cigarette ""enter"" my body, and it damages my health. For example, in my case, only being in the smoking section, the frequency of my coughing becomes pretty high!! And in bad case, I come to have a headache, so I can't sleep well at night. (and very sleepy at school... ) In other words, including some same matters first reason, smoking damages not only people who are smoking, but also people who are around cigarettes, that is, none smoking people like me. So in the place which the window is closed, like restaurant, is easy to damage our body and health. Recently, what is called ""walking cigarette"" is taken in the news program. It also hurts the health of children. So, I am for the opinion. And, I want people who smoke, to pay attention to others around them.",B1.1
"I agree with the ban and would like to see it extended. By that I mean that it could be extended to include any public place. Since it is general public knowledge that smoking and passive smoking kill people and cause numerous degenerative disease and heart attacks and strokes, we are left to wonder as to the continued delays in introducing such a ban. Particularly when it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that these could be prevented and leading medical professionals advise that smoking related deaths are the number one preventable cause of death in the entire world. One can only hope and pray that such a ban would be introduced as quickly as possible. The public for their part can continue to lobby their local congressman or their local government representative whoever that may be on a daily basis. If the government is moving a t a glacial pace on this issue then it's time for the public to pick up the pace and call their local representative every day until the ban is in place not just in a test case scenario, but in place across the country. I am not sure how much warning the government is required to issue however, I would amuse that it would not be less than a month before implementation which is ample time for restaurants to prepare for such a ban.",C2
"I agree with this statement. I have three reasons for this. One of the reasons is that we can make a lot of friends in part-time job. For example, we can see another college students, housewives or free-lances. They bring us new and peasant experiences. They tell us interesting stories that we never have listened. People who we meet in part-time job will benefit us when we start working in the future. The second reason is that we can know the importance of money and the difficulty of working. Part-time job of college students are often teaching for high school students or staffs of restaurants. We work only after school. So we cannot earn many money. Until I enter college, I had gotten allowance from my parents. Now I start part-time job and appreciate their kindness. The third reason is that we can develop our own abilities: we can master politeness if we engage in service occupation or we can become wiser if we give lectures. We can develop abilities which we can't study in college. These abilities will help us in another occasion. For these reasons, I conclude that college student should have various part-time jobs and have a lot of experiences.",B1.1
"I don't agree because it comes down to a civil liberties case, I think. It should be left up to the marketplace to decide and not put in the hands of the government. Since restaurants are usually a free enterprise entity, then they will know soon enough what the majority of their customers' want, when they see their cash flow statements at the end of each month. The smart operators will go with the money as they say and adapt their policies to suit their client's wishes. Others will simply go out of business by trying to be all things to everybody which is an impossible way to run a business and almost guarantees that they will fail. Once the pros and cons have been weighed up by both restaurant owners and patrons, they will more than likely resolve the smoking/non-smoking issue themselves, without government interference. By allowing free enterprise to go with what the market dictates, governments would be following the wishes of the majority of citizens anyway. People are under the illusion that governments rule countries when in fact, it is and always has been, the marketplace that dictates policy. Most governments will then just blindly adhere to whatever the polls infer or ups and downs in the marketplace, which also includes restaurants.",C2
"I totally agree smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. The reasons why I agree are: The restaurants are supposed to be places where offer people great environment and services to have dishes. The smokers should stand in other peoples' shoes; the damage smoke is not they want. In the restaurants, there may be a lot of people including woman who pregnant. Smoking is really could be a damage to her and her baby. Besides, smoking could be a serious damage to our health and the people around you. If you are think you are a great father, you support your family and let your family have a smooth life, you have two little cute children, you have a beautiful wife and she is pregnant... etc, but you have a bad habit---smoking!!! Then you should think much deeper. You possibly get lung cancer after years, the damage of cancer make you have to stay on bed and couldn't work... last, you have no money to afford your family to have a normal life. Next, the second-smoke full of your house, your children, pregnant wife, are all influenced by it. And it cause a serious damage to their body... After picturing your future life, do you really want to smoke now? Finally, the restaurants are public places; the smokers should learn to stop smoking in pubic places. Or there are some pubic places have set a special space for smokers, they should follow the rules.",B1.1
"I agree, but only in the sense that it would really be good for those who have had no real job or work experience before and to get one before they graduate and of course it is a must for the students that need an extra financial resource. On a reality check level, it's a good thing and might also serve to knock the chip off the shoulders of one or two students who could do with a good dose of attitude correctional therapy. For the students that must have a job, it goes without saying that they usually have a better mental approach to working and college. They are more thorough with their work and studies and certainly better organised than most of the others. Partly because they have to be, and partly because they have a clearer understanding of what they need to do and have solid schedule in place to keep them on track. A part-time job can be a blessing or a curse, depending upon each student's emotional maturity levels, outcomes, purpose and actions. Quite often the only difference between those who combine work and college successfully and those who don't is mind set. If the get that part right then students are well on their way and quite likely to achieve their goals.",C2
"Introduced more than one hundred years before, tobacco is playing a more and more important role in people's life than ever before. And now in the modern society, they just seem to be everywhere. A group of people even should smoke in the public place, which I can never ever tolerate. I do hate people smoke in public, because I can not stand the terrible smell. I believe the majority of the non-smokers are the same with me. Those who smoke in the public place don't care about the feelings of the people around them. To that extent, they are not considerate and even uncivilized! I don't think they have the right to put us in the dirty air, which is tatally not fair to us. What's more? The smoke is poisonous. Hundreds of thousands of scientific findings have already showed that the cigarettes contain much harmful substances to human body. We, people who do not smoke, are innocent, when some people tend to have a good time at the cost of the health of the people standby, aren't we? To be critical, they are murdering. In addition, as civilized citizens, they should at least obey the rules and regulations in a certain place. In many public places, there are obvious signs read No smoking. But they just ignore. It's a shame, isn't it. To sum up, from my stand point, smoking in public should be banned strictly. I appeal to all the non-smokers to stand out, make their voice and fight for the rights of us own, the rights to live in the clean healthy air.",B1.2
"If you are a student what will you do when you have time in school Students can find a part time job if they can when they are in university or collage because it can give you a lot exercise and you can get a lot of success from that, not just money but friends, you can do something better when you do part time job, friends is the best way when you do something, If you get hard you can ask help from them no matter where you are, no matter what will you do, no matter who you are, this is a very unforgettable value you own, if you are old you can think about that time you do these things, you can find it is very beautiful, now parents is very hard to do the job and for our family, so do part time job is a good way to do something to relax and help our family.

"I strongly agree with a complete ban on smoking in all restaurants throughout Japan. There are four reasons for this. Firstly, smoking is bad for health. It is now commonly accepted throughout the world that smoking is bad for health. Smoking is not only extremely detrimental to the health of the actual smoker, but more importantly it is now generally agreed that the effects of passive smoking are equally damaging. A meal in a good restaurant should be a leisurely experience, and can often last for two or three hours. Non-smokers dining in restaurants or bars should not have to endure the effects of breathing other people's smoke for long periods. In addition, staff at restaurants work long hours, sometimes in very enclosed spaces. Being able to work in a healthy environment is a basic right. Secondly, children should not be unnecessarily exposed to the bad habits of adults. Children are a regular sight at popular restaurants throughout Japan, especially on weekends. Tobacco is not only unhealthy, but it is also an age-restricted product. Having smokers sitting at the next table sends the wrong signal to children. Thirdly, smoking affects the taste of one's food. One of the pleasures of dining out is experiencing tastes and smells of foods that one might not otherwise eat. When we'taste' food, we are experiencing a combination of sensory signals from both the mouth and nose. The smell of cigarette smoke can change the taste of some foods. Many restaurant managers worry that banning smoking will affect business, however statistics from cities in Europe and the US reveal that there has been no significant loss of business since a blanket ban on smoking was introduced. For these reasons, I fully support a ban on smoking in restaurants.",C2
"Although I am not a smoker myself, I understand that many smokers feel we have gone too far in restricting their right to enjoy tobacco. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. First, Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. But Passive smokers do choose to breathe in other people's smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public. Second, in many places, there are no non-smoking restaurants. These days It's banned in Korea, in restaurants, pubs and inside in all public places, that more than enough, banning it outside is going way too far. However All people have rights, and we cannot limit them. Because smoking is the own choice of every man, it would be very intolerant behavior if people against smoking will limit them. But there is some decision in such hard situation. In restaurants it should be smoking parts, where smokers can smoke and do not disturb others. Its good way for all people. In summary, smokers may know well that their smoking in public places and restaurants leads to a flood of complaints from nonsmokers. Everyone has the right to be safe and healthy in their restaurants, but this basic right can be infringed by smoking. Because of these, smokers must accept the fact that they do not have the right to pollute the air other people inhale, and that restrictions must be placed on their right to smoke",B1.2
" Now, quite a lot of college students take an active part in part-time jobs. They think part-time job can have many advantages. On the one hand, they are eager to develop their ability and broaden their horizon in face of the pressure of employment. One the other hand, with a large portion of their living expense and tuition covered by their parents, they want to earn some money to decrease the pressure their parents are shouldering on. In addition, if they take part-time job, they can get many experiences from them. However, there are still many college students who have never take a part-time job. They are unwilling to challenge themselves and reluctant to do it. They think their first task is to study rather than a part-time job. What's more, some students say that they are busy. I believe that the so-called busy is just an excuse. Personally speaking, a part-time job is quite necessary for a college student. College is no longer like the high school. It's a place whose purpose is to cultivate independent and intelligent person. So if you have more time after you classroom time, try to take your chance to find a good part-time job. You will have many benefits.",A2
"It is common knowledge that smoking is detrimental to health. Although smoking is a personal choice, it can become a public affair especially when the smoke is inhaled as second-hand smoke, which is equally harmful as smoking directly. This reason in itself is substantial enough to call for a ban of smoking in public areas. In Singapore, the prohibition of smoking has gradually been extended from hawker centers to void decks. However, there still remain areas that the law does not cover. One of these areas is the bus stop, especially when it is crowded, one person smoking can easily cause irritation to all the other people waiting for the bus. Of course, one may say that it is unethical to ban smoking in public places. After all, smoking is a personal choice, and by placing a ban, it is tantamount to infringing upon the personal rights of that person. However, it must be noted that in this case, the right of choosing to smoke is not infringed. The smoker still can smoke; just that he is limited to smoking only on his own property. Smoking in restaurants not only causes health hazards, but also poses a risk to the cleanliness of the food served as well as the general ambience of the restaurant. Surely no one wants to eat in a restaurant that has smoke all round? Thus, it is not unethical to ban smoking in restaurants. In fact, it is ethical, because only then can the good of the majority by maximized. ",B1.2
"It is important for college students to have a part-time job. These days, university fee is very expensive. So, my parents is very difficult in financial. Having a Part-time job is helping my parents. And part-time job have a variety experience. I think Part-time job is small society. So we learn about society. I have a part-time job, too. Every weekend, I go to the Spaghetti house, Piatto. In fact, serving is tired and get a stress. But, I have a pride in Piatto and make some friends. And I earn some money. So, I'm happy to work at Piatto. Part-time job gives fun and interesting. College students should not be studying. I think that college students are has variety experience is important. We will have a job. Part-time job give an elementary to get a job in my future. We earn some money that gives me economic Concepts. I think that is important for college students to have a part-time job. It gives me pleasure and experience. Part-time job has a lot of benefits. I want many students have a part-time job. And I want work in Piatto manager. Part-time job gives future dream. I want much part-time job experience.",B1.1
"To achieve a milestone of having a smoke-free environment and a healthier population, the country has imposed bans on several public places, including restaurants. Smokers are only allowed to smoke at demarcated areas in some restaurants where it would be prohibited elsewhere within the restaurant premises. Most restaurants also ban smoking within their entire premises. This is considerably attributed to take into consideration the non-smokers who would not appreciate, feel unpleasant or even be irritated at the presence of cigarette smoke while they are consuming food and/or beverages in the restaurant. Besides being a health hazard, smoking in the restaurant could also pose a hygiene hazard if the food or beverage is contaminated with cigarette content while being consumed, even if the consumer is not smoking. Restaurants may not be willing to impose a smoking ban (unless the authorities say so) because it may drive some of their customers away from patronising them, since the smokers may be able to find alternatives where smoking is allowed within the premises (or a certain portion thereof). These will discourage restaurants from imposing a smoking ban, and instead encourage restaurants who allow smoking with potentially more customers. To really discourage smokers from smoking, smoking bans should become more stringent to include all restaurants in the country banning smoking. This should actually encourage smokers to quit smoking, instead of being succumbed to temptation by finding another spot where they are actually allowed to smoke. Eventually the country should aim for its people to lead a healthy lifestyle, which should have been the real purpose of banning smoking in so many public places. ",B1.2
"Recently, smoking has been banned at many places such as planes, buses, trains and so on. That is because smoking troubles many people. Tobacco has many toxic chemicals. Smokers sometimes suffer from serious diseases, such as lung cancer. Besides, smoking does harm not only to smokers but also to non-smokers. Non-smokers can breathe smoke and fall sick if they are near smokers. It is called passive smoking. Some non-smokers will know this and hate tobacco. Especially, in the restaurant, many people will enjoy eating and talking with friends or families. If some people smoke, the restaurant is filled with smoke and people feel unpleasant. Then, they can no longer enjoy talking and taste dishes. It is very unhappy. Restaurant is the place where many people relax and enjoy dining. Customers go to restaurant for the purpose of it. They should not be offended by smoking. Smoking should be strictly banned at the restaurant. However, some non-smokers may argue that they cannot enjoy eating in the restaurant if smoking is banned there. But restaurant is the special places. Smokers can smoke in private places, such as their home but customers can enjoy eating better than usual only at the restaurant. Non-smokers should be respected.",A2
"I agree that there should be measures to deal with smoking in restaurants whether big or small. Because of smoke in a restaurant disturb the person at the table and others to eat in a restaurant. It is bad manners, if we smoke while dining with others. Cigarette smokes interfere with other people. It also has a foul odor. It makes eating food are not happy. Most restaurants and the room are closed. And some of the open air, it will make spreading smoke across the room and can not drain out. It affects everyone eating in a restaurant. In which it has both children and the elderly, pregnant women may have. Cigarette smoke may result in a lot with these people. If you get it into the large volume may cause an effect on health. If the restaurant has a severe allergy is a serious danger. Therefore, measures should be apart of the smoking ban in restaurants and possibly to the public. We should create a society that should not smoke in public places. Everyone together on this campaign seriously, through cooperation from the private sector, including operators and the media. And more importantly who smoke should be aware of the consequences. If you are smoking, it should be in place where appropriate. Do not create trouble for others.",B1.2
"I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job. Since college students must learn relation of society, common sences, And communication skills. They are needed incredibly after graduation Of the colleges. To explain his or her company's production or ideas To cooperative companies, communication skill is absolutely needed. On the other hand, common sences is needed whether students will Work on company or not. No one can live alone. So, needless to say, communication and common sences are very important to all the people. But I think they are learned more in worker's relations than in college Student's relations. For example, when I worked on IZAKAYA--Japanese bar--, I missed The form of cooking, then co-worker who is older than I became angry, But thaught me the correct form of cooking kindly. On the one hand, When I came there lately, the owner came to me and told me the importance Of keep a time in society. And I still remember the words. In college students relation, It is difficult to say the miss and to tell the Caution. But in worker's relation, one can say the misses and caution him or her. So I agree with the idea that college students should have a part-time job.",B1.1
"I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at restaurants in Japan and I have many reasons for this opinion. First, I think that smoking is very dirty and is very bad for all the people who do it. It would be a nice gift to smokers to give them a good motivation an opportunity to quit smoking, as people who smoke often have a very difficult time quitting on their own due to the addictive effects of nicotine and other chemicals contained within cigarettes. Next, it is not fair to nonsmokers to have to eat in a restaurant that is filled with cigarette smoke because they have to breathe that in and it is worse for their health than it is for the smokers. Secondhand smoke really can kill people, and I did have one friend who grew up in a household in which his parents smoked very heavily, and he had health problems for a long time. Once he moved out of that house, he became much more healthy and vibrant. Smoking is bad for you no matter where you are in the world, so I think that Japan should ban smoking at the restaurants in the same way that the U. S. is beginning to ban smoking at the restaurants here too.",C2
"I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two reasons for me to agree it. First, college students need much money because we have to buy expensive text books, clothes, food, and so on. We cannot cover these expenses with only remittance from our parents. Moreover if we travel abroad, we will need much money. But it is not good to ask our parents to pay travelling expenses. I have lived alone since this April, and I realize that I do not have enough money to enjoy myself. Recently, I swear not to buy sweets because they are very expensive, although I like sweets very much. Without money, I can buy nothing. So we should have a part-time job to get money. Second, we can learn a lot of thing from a part-time job. For example, we can learn human relationships in society and we can really realize how hard work is. We can develop as a person through a part-time job. Now, I work at a bread shop as a part-time clerk. And there, I could become acquaintance with various generations and I could learn manners in society and importance of responsibility. I think I could become mature person than before. From these points of view, I think that a part-time job is very important for college students.",B1.1
"There are many benefits of having a part-time job for college students, so I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. By having a part-time job, students are able to expand their set of skills and to expand the set of talents that they will use when they one day find a career. This is very important because if students cannot become skilled enough to find a fulltime job after they graduate, they will have wasted part of their lives in college. I agree that it is very important for college students to spend a lot of their time studying, but a few hours of part-time work every week shouldn't be so bad that students start to fail their classes and start cutting classes too. Therefore, any student who thinks that having a part-time job is a bad idea is simply afraid of having to work a little bit hard or to do some great things for himself. Many people have some strange psychological fear of success, and they allow this to impact their career and life choices as well as their level of happiness. So, buck up, find a part-time job, and start working your way to happiness today.",C2
"I disagree with the above statement for several reasons. First, we (thankfully) live not in a communist or fascist nation, but in a democratic one. The underlying pillar of a democracy is the right to choose how to live. This right of choice must extend to restaurants. Ownership should have the right to permit smoking on their premises. Ownership must, however, be clear in letting both their employees and customers know that smoking is permitted. I think signage outside the restaurant should be mandatory, clearly stating the smoking situation. In this manner, both future employees and patrons can exercise their right of choice. If they wish to accept the harm that smoking related illnesses cause, it is indeed their right. Must government regulate all lifestyle choices that harm people? Should Big-Mac sales be regulated, because over indulgence leads to obesity? Should alcohol sales be banned, because over indulgence/reliance leads to innumerable problems? No and No. People have the core right to choose how to live their lives regardless of our agreement. I personally loathe smoking. I find it a foul smelling and disgusting habit. For this reason, I am a big fan of Starbucks, who ban smoking in their stores worldwide.",C2
"It is of no doubts that smoking causes health problems and other social issues. Thus, I strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. The problems brought about by smoking far exceeds the economical or other benefits it brings to the country. Firstly, and most importantly, smoking not only harms the individual, but also harms the people around. As one might know, second hand smoke are more toxic than first hand smoke. Hence, the smoker bring harm to other people who are not smoking at all. This is definitely an inconsiderate act. Additionally, the harmful effects that smoking brings about is not just some simple seasonal flu or random coughs. Here, we are talking about lung cancers, nasal cancers and many other associated diseases associated with smoking. One might also know that the treatment cost for cancers are extremely high, and it can be a burden even to the people with middle high income group. Besides that, smoking usually cause cancers after many years, hence, when the individual is old, the amount of pain the individual is going to suffer will be greater as he or she will be more susceptible to other diseases due to smoking dampening his or her immune system. Besides that, restaurants are usually closed environment. Hence, the smoke which gets exhaled out from the smoker will be circulated in the restaurant for many cycles. This will lead to many serious health problems as mentioned. Consequently, the staff working in the restaurant will suffer the most. The consequences compounds when the restaurant staff is the breadwinner of the family or if he or she is a student. This will lead to social and health issues. Thus, it's evident that smoking should be banned in all restaurants. ",B1.2
"At recently, there is a heated view whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. With the development of the society, Smoking has became a world problem. there are more and more people to smoke. Many people think pressure of family, work, life lead to smoke. Though smoker have many reasons to smoke. they think smoking is own thing. But in my opinion, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. On the one hand, Smoking will be effect people's health and life. People will have a bad effects. Some people start to smoke when they are young. When they stop to smoke they feel terrible. They will feel headache. Whatever they do, they don't have no action. On the other hand, when you smoke in restaurants, you will be effect other people's health. It have worse effects. it will destroy restaurants environment. And non-smoker will be terrible. So smoker effect another. They maybe do not find their action will hurt anther people. Though analysis of above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The government could make law to forbid smoking in restaurants. And it warn smoking will effect yourself and another people's health. It will many good aspects to life. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China.",B1.1
"The purpose of a ban may be to create a healthier eating environment, and when combined with other measures the ultimate goal of a smoke-free country may be fulfilled. The bans in restaurants may be successful if it is imposed well. In Singapore, just as how smoking is disallowed in air-conditioned malls, public transport and other public amenities, the ban is only effective if the general society, including smokers, is agreeable to adhering to the ban. In many local food establishments, sections of outdoor areas have been marked out for smoking customers to limit the extent of smoke circulation. The immediate benefit of the complete ban appears to be to non-smokers. However, this further compounds the problems that smokers face. Previously met with the limited choice of restaurants which offer smoking areas or to settle for a smoke-free one, they now no longer have any restaurants at which to smoke and dine at the same time. The ban will not go down well with the smoking community. The sole fact that cigarette smoke is harmful to health does not seem to qualify a complete clampdown on smokers at restaurants. It is likely that the ban is also meant to create a cleaner society and send out a strong signal of deterrence to smokers by making smoking highly inconvenient. The ban may be part of greater plans to encourage smokers to quit and discourage other from picking up the habit. The observable situation in my country is that the demarcation of smoking areas in restaurants seems to be effective at providing for both smokers and non-smokers. An extreme and complete ban on smoking at all restaurants will not serve to dissuade smokers as much as it will cause great unhappiness among smokers, who should deserve their right to smoke and dine.

"I am strongly agree about Student to have a part time job is important because student the get money and I am disagree with college student to have a part job because disturb the other activity. The student have many necessary. Example student needs some necessary out days. And student help our parent too. necessary is our parent is very much. College student have in come money, so we are needs family condition. for college students to have a part time job. We are have cheer up about work hard. It is important for college students to have a part time job choose job is we are anything that can. And because if we have a part time job, we will get good job. And to reset a lot of money. When we have a part of job, we must seriously doing to work and we will learn to manage our time specifically student who has a tight schedule. They can study how to be business. It is not important for college student to have a part time job because disturb the other activity. Work to student only study. So we must focus in the study. So, we must to manage for time. Student don't needs a part time job because student really don't need a job. They don't burden to is with their job on their responsibility is study because the student should study.",A2
"In this time, many college students already have a job. Actually it is an part time job. Part time job is a Job that have a reduced work time almost half from the normal work time. And the salary its not as much as salary of the full worker job. The salary of the part time worker is about from Rp500. 000(about fifty dollars) to Rp 2. 000. 000, 00 (about two hundred dollars). It can exceed two hundred dollars depends on what part time job do you take and how many hours the job or how difficult the work. I say it was important, because college students can get more experience before he feel the reality world of the business world. College students can feel how hard it takes to make some money, so he become more mature naturally. Part time work can increase students skill ( if the part time job he takes is the same with his major). It can train a skill of managing time from the student. If he take a part time job, the student must arrange his or her part time schedule with his college schedule. So, it will train the college student discipline. That's why I believe part time job is important for college student.",B1.2
"I agree to have a part-time job by college students. Firstly, it is important for college students to earn money by themselves. If they worked, they were realized that money is valuable. Secondly, they can know the real society. And, this experience is sure to help your working in the company. Finally there are many people and they are several ages. So you speak senior people or younger people and you can know the way to respect older people. To be sure, you careful of your phrase. These experiences are inevitable for us to survive. Indeed part-time job spare they their time and they can not study hard. I also think that college student's work is studying. But it is more important for human to enjoy with friends than only studying. In case of friends is including colleague. Nowadays, most young people hardly communicate their opinion for other people. Because they spend all of time in their home. I strongly suggest that to go to anywhere and to speak many people. So I think that to have a part-time job is important for college students.",B1.1
"From my personal point of view, college students should have a part-time job. It will bring more advantages to their lives especially financial and social skill. For financial, it is good for students that they can earn money by themselves without bothering money from their parents, so that students might bother their parents' money only for tuition. Beside, they could gain more social skill from their works. For example, they might meet more people from many backgrounds, so I think it is good for students to learn about other people and they could lean how to live with different people. So, students will have more living skill to live in the society of variation. Moreover, doing a part-time job might widen students' worldview. For instance, some student might be very shy in the class, but when they live in the outside society, they might not be shy anymore. On the other hand, having a part-time job also has some problem; it might interrupt students' class hour sometimes. In my opinion, I think it is not a big deal for students who do want to have a part-time job. It is because they should know their limit to do a part-time job. So, part-time job will not waste their study. Anyway, having a part-time job of college students brings them more advantages though.",B1.1
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, although it takes time to have a part-time job, you can learn different experience that you can not learn from class. For example, you can learn how to associate with colleague who is older or younger than you. Because being a student for over ten years we always get along to someone who has same age as you when we get into the society we have to work with many people who have very different life experience or age. If you have a part-time job when college you can get along with colleague better. Second, you will know that it is hard to earn money and you will use your money well. Being a college student you have much more free time than being a junior or senior high school student. In other words, you will have a lot of time to hang out with your friend, it takes money. If you have a part-time job, you will have additional money to hang out with your friends and you will feel less sorry for spend money which parents give you. Last of all, you will learn some professional knowledge from your work. Take me for example I have a part-time job in our department office for about one and half years. During these time, I have learned how to send governmental, how to operate machines in our office and many rule of our school. Although it is tired to have a part-time job, I learn many things from working. Therefore I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons about my opinion. Firstly, it is bad for us to smoke, though this is not only problem in the restaurants. And smoking does not only harm the smokers, but also harm the nonsmokers. I think that this is a strange story. Smoking not only harms the customers who come to a restaurant but also harms the workers who work on a restaurant. If we work on restaurant from morning till night everyday, the passive smoking will harm our health. Passive smoking is the act of breathing in smoke from other people's cigarettes. The passive smoking more harms our health than the active smoking. So if we make our health care hard, it may be bad for us to work on a restaurant. I think that we should keep our offices clean, when we consider the worker's health. Secondly, smoking makes the taste of a delicious meal bad. And smoking also spoils a cheerful mood of the meal. We do not come to enjoy at all for this. I had had a hot time with my friends, when I went to a restaurant with friends. But I got out of the restaurant, for I hated next customer to smoke. Therefore, I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"Do you need any part time jobs? It is source of income to support your life. Different people may have different values on the part time job. In my point of view, part time job can bring some income to me to support my life. Therefore, I don't think whether the part time job is good or bad. I will take it and do my best to earn much money as I can. Although I may feel unhappy when the job is so tough. I would be willing to do the part time job for my free time out of college. Also, I look at it as a good opportunity for me to gain work experience. It may be beneficial to my next job search. It also provide me with an environment to learning the communication skills and understanding more about the career culture. I think it will be a meaningful experience. However, many parents may think that doing part time job is a waste of time. It is because the part time job greatly consume your time and you cannot achieve a good result when you are doing part time job. In conclusion, I can gain the working experience and money from doing part time job. It is necessary and should be more important than my study.",B1.1
"The Toss of the Coin If one side of the coin can brand you, which side would you be? In a world where almost every little thing is given attention and judged, it is not hard to imagine how even people themselves, are classified into small groups and niches. No matter how much equality is empowered and believed in, there will always be differences between culture, status, religion, nationality, race, colour, and possibly, every characteristic a person can be grouped into. There is always this barrier of contrasts and somehow, it has even reached and now resides within the four walls of each and every school. Students are easily categorized into twoâ€” the elite and rich kids, and the scholars. The wealthy ones are usually in good schools and can afford not only their needs but also their luxuries in life. They are dependent on their parents so they don't really have to work too hard to finish school. All they have to focus on are their studies. On the other hand, there are those students who hardly even have enough money for all the things they need. They are those who have to work their way up to graduation and yet things won't still be enough. Most often than not, they need to take part time jobs just so they can continue with their studies and finish college. It is not important whether one is rich or one is poor. No one should be branded. Whether a student finishes college because of working part time or not is not the real question to ask. What truly matters is that he attains his goals, reaches his dreams, and makes a difference. So whether you choose tails or heads, it doesn't really count much. Question is do you win the game?",B1.2
"I find it hard to make a generalisation on whether it's important or not for college students to have a part-time job, because this seems like something very individual and highly dependent on the individual student and their circumstances. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job to be more important for them than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond the merely academic, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisure, rather than on a job. A final hypothetical student might meanwhile be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardise their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all of them. ",B2
Usually there is two types of jobs. One is main job that is All time job and the other is part time which is done in extra time. Part time job is a short period job. Some people do part time job in Morning and some do in the evening and some do at night. Some do this job due to extra time and wants to keep them busy. The prices of every things is sky high people do this job to low the burden of expenses this job helps the needy people. This is usually done by the students in foreign country to afford the expenses. In morning student went to colleges and at night they went for part time job. This gives benefits to the students. Some of the student do this job because their family background is not strong to bear their expenses. And they do this job for their self support. So in this way part time job is very necessary for them. Usually this job is done by common man as a source of extra income. Part time job is also done by students to bear their study expenses and also to support their family. Woman also do this part time job as a source of income or have extra time.,B1.1
"Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for the sake of everyone's health. Restaurants are for eating not for smoking. Most of non-smoker people don't like the smell of the cigarettes. I heard from the television that it is more dangerous if you inhale the smoke from the cigarette than smoking the cigarette. Restaurant is a public place where many people come and go to eat and to respect them, smokers should not smoke inside the restaurant, in the bathroom of the restaurant and near the door or exit place of the restaurant because we don't know if there is a person who have a disease in the lungs or if it's not good for them to smell cigarette smoke. If smokers still continue to smoke in public, people who do not smoke will suffer from fume and smell. Another thing, there are a lot of children in public places and restaurants. It is not good for them if they see an adult smoking because they can learn from it and they will imitate and try to smoke too even at their young age. Most especially, smoking is very bad for the health of a person. Even we live in a democratic country, where it is free to do anything you like, we must remeber that we need to respect other people in our surroundings. We, non-smokers doesn't disturb or prohibit your individual freedom and selection. In exchange of that, you should also respect people who don't smoke and don't like the smell of the cigarettes.",B1.2
"What nutrient you get from smoking? I see nothing good for my health from smoking. Those who smoke are very unhealthy and are banned from people who don't smoke. Whoever is good looking always looks bad when smoking. Nowadays smoking is banned in many places such as at schools, hospital s especially at restaurants. And I strongly agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants because of two reasons. First, restaurants should be places for meal time not for smoking time. Everyone would like to enjoy meals without smoking. We all want to smell delicious food rather than cigarette's smell. Is the cigarette more delicious than food? If someone thinks it is, please get out off restaurants and enjoy smoking. Second, smoking destroys good atmosphere at restaurants and very bad for people's health especially people who don't smoke. They smell cigarette's smoke which is a second hand effect and cigarette's smoke affects people's health. If those who smoke use their money they spend on buying cigarette to buy healthy food, how healthy they are and how longer their lives will be. In short, there should be serious rules to control people who smoke. If they want to smoke, please get away from healthy people and enjoy their smoky world. People can be good looking without smoking. So, better give up right now. You will be one of charming people.",B1.2
"As far as I can remember, I haven't thought about the thing that called a part-time job yet. But, I know only the thing that called 'hobby', which I find it more interesting than anything containing the word 'job'. Furthermore, there're way more fun if I don't think about anything as some kinds of job; I always think about anything I have to do as some kinds of games or puzzles that needed to be solved instead, which is more, well, fun and exciting! All I can say that it's IMPORTANT! Especially for those who don't have much allowance for the budget, and having a part-time job is the way to keep their budget affordable to many kinds of expenses. Do you want some further supporting reasons? Then let me talk like this; you may get some tip if you've done a good job on your work. Most employers love those diligent, honest and skillful fellows, you know? And of course, they'll gladly pay you more and looking forward to assign you to be one of their staff if you can keep up with your outstanding performance. And that'll be all of what I have to talk about how important of the part-time job. It's just a short recap from my whole thought of this thing because a part-time job can teach you so many things, especially things like diligence, honesty and sometimes, courage; you may bump into such serious situation and you have to carry out that thing no matter how hard it is, that's the reason why it can teach you to be courageous, too. So, if you have a spare time, then go find a job. It's simple as it is, but keep up your good work!",B1.2
"I agree with this statement. This is because college students need to know what working is like. First of all, I talk about my example. When I was the first grade at university, I didn't have a part-time job. But now, I am the second grade and have a part-time job, because I want to learn what working is like before I graduate from university. At first I was worried and tired, but now I am used to my job. And I can know how difficult communicating with many people is and know making money is not easy, and so on. I cannot learn those things from a lecture in university. Then, I explain why you have to know how working is while you are college student. Some people say that college students should not have a part-time job because they work too hard to study in a lecture. Of course, studying is very important. However, will you really need only an academic skill in the future? You'll work with many people such as co-workers, bosses or customers. And you have to communicate with them. Even if you sufficiently have an academic skill, you can't work alone. Recently, people who don't have a job have been increasing. Some people don't work though they graduate from a college. After they graduate from their college, they have a job. But, they bother about human relations and resign their job. Therefore, you should be used to communicating with many people while you are college student. In university, you mainly talk to your friend. But, if you have a part-time job, you have to contact with many people. You can learn from a part-time job how to communicate with many people. So to conclude, college students need to have a part-time job.",B1.1
"College students should have part time jobs. First of all, part time jobs can help student to be an independent person financially. Having a part time job during a school time can help student to reduce their parents' expenses. Students can make their own money to get all their needs. They won't ask any loan from their friends and they won't depend on their parents anymore in fulfilling some of their needs. For example, they can make their own account at the bank while they're still study at college so they can ease to fulfill their needs. Besides, part time jobs not only give advantages in their financial condition but also give them new skills to learn about Time Management and Communication skills. Once you begin work, you will have different environment between school and work. They may be having several works or projects while they're working and it can help them to learn how to manage their time between school and work. They will learn to organize their activities in such a good time order so that they will be able to know when is the right time to do either their school projects or their working-projects. Therefore, they will indirectly get skills to manage their time. It can also help them to learn about soft communication skills. Not only they can make a deal with many different people at work but they can also know how to behave this kind of people and how to behave that kind of people. So, for all of these reasons I believe that college students should have part time jobs since it gives advantages for the students' life before and after graduate.",B1.2
"I strongly support the banning of smoking at all the restaurants in the country. When I go on the street, I saw some people who smoke. Smokers have freedom to smoke. So outside of the public room, non-smokers cannot criticize them. But I dislike smoke very much. In spite of the moment of walking on the street for the short time, I feel very uncomfortable and hateful to that smoke. This is the reason why at that time I run fast stuffing my nose and mouth. In the reastant the smoke can be much more sensitive. Because smoking can interefere the clear environment of restaurant where we have a good time eating the delicious food. On top of that, the food can be polluted by the smoke chemicals. Therefore, smokers have to keep the public courtesy in the restaurant. If we have to respect the smokers in the restaurant, it is good idea to make the smoke-room in there. Smoke-room is only the place where smokers can be in. On the reason that they smoke one another, they can not be careful of smoke, Smoking is allowed in that space. In this way, smoke-room can be solution to respect the smokers in the restaurant. Were it not for that smoke-room, smokers can rigidly follow the rule that they must not smoke. The scientific research shows that indirect smoke are harmful to the health. Smokers can have a bad influence of the nonsmokers as well as themselves. They have to be careful because we are the member of the community.",B2
" Smoking is a kind of annoyed behavior in the eyes of the people who don't smoke. Why are people smoke? I think some people find tobacco can let him or her excited after smoking, Other people think smoking stands for cool and wealthy, there is an another reason, the people who was under the great pressure want to find a way to reduce it. However, Smoking is an unhealth behavior which bring a lot harmful not only smoker itself but other people stay nearby. When I smell the smoke I feels headache, so, I hate someone smokes besides me. I think there are lots of people feel strongly annoyed when someone smoking in public. Nowadays, many countries have set the law to prevent the rights of people who doesn't smoke. The law says no smoking in public, if you wants to smoke, you must be alone without anyone nearby or go to the smoking zoom. I think this law indicate that more and more people desire a clean environment. One more rules between human being is when you do something yourself you can't make trouble to other people, otherwise the society would turn into upset&down. Do not smoke in the public I think is important both to society and citizens, which could made great process to the civilization of human being.",B1.2
"Part time job is a must for college students. Yes, it may be a burden but it also has lots of benefits. Here are some reasons why college students should engage theirselves in part time jobs. First of all. Due to extensive poverty and high tuition fees, not every parents can afford to send their sons and daughters to college. Inorder to solve the said problem, students may get a part time job to lessen thei parent's burden and for them to be able to go to college. Secondly. Students don't just earn money, But also experience which could be of a benefit for them. Involving theirselves in part time jobs helps them improve the following: Their communal skill/ social skills. Their time management strategies. And mostly their accountability. Lastly. Part time jobs are fun. You'll met new peers and you'll even know yourself better. It wont just help you get ready to face the real world, instead It'll also help you face the world with others. You'll meet different persons with different attitudes and point of views, through this you'll be able to adjust yourself towards others and you'll learn how to work with others who are different from you. You'll also be able to know your strenghts and weakness. And the career you 'd like to have after you graduate. So for me, college student must engage/ involve theirselves in part time jobs. For It wont just be of a help for them financially, but also personally and socially.",B1.2
"In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. As you know, restaurants are public places; the government in our country recently has published the policy that cigarette smoking is not allowed in public places. Smoking is just a personal preference. As a citizen, we cannot interfere with other people just because of your own selfish. After all, people who smoke are only in the minority. But some people who like smoking insist that smoking should not be banned in the restaurant. As to them, smoking is part of their life. They rely on cigarette, and they think that smoking give them inspirations and power, it also can relieve their innate anxiety. As far as I am concerned, smoking still should not be allowed in the restaurants. First of all, smoking is harm to our health; there are a lot of evidences and information showing that many diseases are caused by smoking. Such as lung cancer, heart trouble, and so on. What's worse, the harm do to the nonsmokers who breathe in the smoke is more serious than smokers. Second, there have been lots of accident fires causing by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the burning cigarette here and there. Their behavior may cause fire. It will not only cause great loss, but also destroy the environment. It really does harm to our society and security Third, smoking in the restaurant is uncivil. It leaves others an impression that these people who smoke in the restaurant are selfish and immoral.",B1.2
"I am strongly agree. Because smoking will do you and people in the restaurants bad healthy. Besides inside the restaurant have bad smell. When a lot of people in the restaurant receive bad smell, it was done yours bad healthy. Perhaps I think, should have regulation for restaurant. Or when have person smoking in the restaurant, the owner fine person. And smoking has pollution in the restaurant. Cigarette was done people bad healthy. The owner of the restaurants should put a big sign in front of the restaurants that no smoking in this place. If all the restaurant bane smoking, it reduce people to smoke because no one welcome. I go to the restaurant and someone smoke, I ask him to stop smoking and he ignore so I ask the owner to change my table. I still smell the cigarettes so I ask them to check my table and I go out. If the restaurants don't allow smokers, they won't lost a customer who don't like smoking. Smoking make people have lung cancer and mouth cancer. It's very suffering when dying. I see many pictures about people who have cancer from smoking. It's very dangerous and disgusting. I really hope that it will be completely banned soon.",A2
"Balancing school and work is the hardest job a part-time worker college student has to face everyday. It may be ridiculous for some that a college student will go to work after school but for some, everything depends on these part-time jobs. Truthfully, the world is becoming inhuman. Putting money first before human lives is becoming typical. The same goes for college students working their lives off while studying at the same time. They spend 4-6 hours after school in their own respective part-time jobs. It is a common trend in today's world. To achieve a decent life and a prosperous future, one should acquire a suitable amount of money for a good education. Making money while in college is ideal for students. It becomes a priority for most students to get a part-time job to support their own studies. A working student drains the energy allotted for studying at work and sadly, not all companies or business establishments give considerations for these unfortunate students. Examples of these considerations are giving a flexible schedule and/or awarding a good salary for working students. If administered properly, part-time jobs can be an advantage for college students. It is all about the experience of working even before graduating. Some employers would love to hire fresh graduates who undergo deeper job training through part-time jobs in their college years. There is also a possibility that part-time jobs can also help college students in maintaining a healthy social life even under the heavy pressure of their studies through having both college friends and co-workers. A part-time job plays an important role to most college students nowadays. Even though some may not be in need of money, it is an essential experience that is worth all the hardships. It all depends on the student handling it.",B1.2
"The experience gained from a part-time job is priceless. My first job was being a waitress at my parent's friend's restaurant. I thought being a waitress was to just be friendly and take orders and then the customers would leave you a generous tip for writing down their order so well. I had a positive outlook and attitude on my first day at work; however, things did not go as I had hoped for. First, I did not make myself clear enough to the cook when I asked him not to add garlic to a customer's dish. He mistakenly thought I said to add extra garlic to the dish and the customer was obviously not happy. Then, I spilled a cup of soda on a customer's blouse. To make things worse, one of the restaurant's most loyal customers demanded to speak with my manager because she accused me of spitting in her drink. Just from this one day of working, I learned that being a waitress meant much more than taking orders. You must live by the ""customers are always right"" motto and good communication is a must. I obviously was not a waitress for very long. My next job was a cashier at a supermarket. The ability to communicate well with patrons here was a very vital part of my job. Currently, I am a nail technician where my development of communication skills is very useful when working with my clients. Through my part-time jobs, I have come across many real world situations that I now have knowledge of.",B1.1
"The division of the eating out. Be considered a brief rest with the people you love. In addition to the already relaxed. Also to release emotional stress as well.

"As with my last response, I feel that it is much easier to rely on numbers than it is to make qualitative arguments that have no real basis. I have to admit that I am not as well educated on the subject of smoking and I have not recently read any news about the subject, but I would venture to say that an overwhelming majority of people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants. That's it. No more discussion. We live in a democratic society, and I am not sure if Japan as a democratic society as well, but if the majority of people there think smoking should be banned in restaurants too, then they should just do it. By living in a democratic society, we have agreed to support the idea that the majority rules. One thing that makes this difficult, however, is that most democratic societies also put a strong emphasis on freedom of speech and action. No one should be persecuted for their beliefs or for their actions, and so in some ways it is difficult to approach this object in a completely satisfactory way. Nonetheless, if the majority of Japanese people think that smoking should be banned in restaurants, it should.",C2
"I think that college students have a part-time jab before graduating from university. Because they didn't have any experience about a part-time job, they will be embarrassed in society. In my case when I was a fresh man, I worked Lotto Riau as a part time worker for one year. And my parents recommended me to have a part-time job before going to army. I think it was good experience for me to meet various people and got little money. Even though I got living money from my parents, that was not enough to live. But since I had a part-time job, I could live better than I didn't have it. There is a bad aspect. It means I couldn't concentrate on my study. After working for 6 months, I thought whether I stop working or not. My choice was keep it going. At that time, I was young. So I had many chance in future and I had to go to army. Now I don't regret it. If I turn a fresh man, I would work also. Some people think having a part-time job is spent time in their life. Otherwise people who would have a part-time job, they will be succeed than no having experience. If you are living in Korea, I want you to have a part-time job when you are young.",B2
"Smoking is a serious addition. It is the start of all crimes. Smoking is the first step toward heavy drug addiction. Once a person falls victim of this habit it difficult to take him out from it. Now days it has become a popular habit of the youngsters too. It contains the ingredients nicotine, tea carcinogens and the smoke produce carbon monoxide which blocks the respiratory track and causes difficulty in breathing. It causes cancer and lungs, mouth disease, carcinogens reproduce. It's very difficult to get out from this situation. No country of the world has survived from this worse. This situation can be esteemed for this present nation that in 1999 world bangle estimated cigarette sales in south Asia where 175million and Pakistan which is 10% of south Asia shakes 32% cigarette sales. Now the situation has become out of control. If we will not take the responsibilities we will be destroyed. Islam provides us the best environment in which we can live peacefully so Islam has prohibited us from such activities and the Prophet Muhammad (PUBH) said that every drug that intoxicates the mind is a case. It is sorrowful to say that even the well-known people of the country are not of the present situation and the government is taking no steps and is to paying attention towards the wretched weds that have faith victim of this curse disease. Now if we will not take the responsibility we cannot stop it until every one of us will step forward to save the people. Restaurants are the place where people sit together with their families and enjoy their free time peacefully. Restaurants have great importance in the whole society but now days they have also been awarded by smokers and are showing a bad effect on the whole society. So, we should try to remove this from the society and make it a peaceful place for living.",B1.2
"Nowadays many college students in Indonesia have a part-time job with different purpose. College student is brave to take a part-time job, because they have free time at every day. We know if college student enter to campus only 2-4 hour in one day. And they think if have a part-time, so he can help her parents in administration, have add pocket money in one month, etc I disagree with the statement, if college student to have a part-time job is important, because that activity have bad effect for college student. College student is must always healthy and concentration, so can get all knowledge from lecture easily. But if have a part-time job we hardly to manage our body, because we more focus with the job and we forget to eat and drink, so make we sick and no present in the campus. No present in the campus make we have bad score and no understand in every lesson. Not only that, if have a part time job, we will more long time to graduate and we must pay more. So we useless have a part-time job because have many negative effects more than positive effects. I will give suggestion for reader, if you do something you must ready with consequences. So you must prepare at now and you must look in all side. And you must always have positive thinking about all that you do if you want positive value.",B1.1
"When I see someone smoking, I always walk to the other side from that person. I think it's really bad to be nearly because the smoke from cigarette can't make me feel relax or good. So I feel that smoking in the restaurant can be dangerous for people. In smoke there is carbon monoxide or ammonium which could make the problems for the earth. Perhaps it can make the fire when smoking persons aren't careful. And the smoke can increase the earth temperature. That leads to be the global warming. Because in our earth there aren't enough trees to absorb the toxic gas and recycle them to be the fresh air. Furthermore, smoking is bad for people who smoke and people who surrounded by them because they can get all smoke into their body and smoke can cause lots of disease such as cancer, lung, stomach, liver, spleen and cardiovascular diseases. Then their health will get down and their life periods will be shorter than they can hope. In the other hand, if the restaurants want to have spaces for smoking, I think they should separate this part far from non-smoking persons. And they should have a system to clean and clear the air to be fresh air. There are many ways to do like that and the restaurant owners should have ideas. For me, I think the trees can do it. So I think we shouldn't smoke in the restaurant because we have to think about other persons around us and don't make them have bad health.",B1.2
"I don't like smoke. So I think smoking should be completely banned at the all restaurant in Japan. There are some reasons. First, people who smoke bother other people who don't smoke. For example, when I went to the restaurant with my friend, there were some people who smoked. Then, our pleasant dinner was over. We were tired of smoke. And when we got out the restaurant, our clothes smelled bad. I felt bad. Like this, smoking bother people. Second, smoking is no good for health. I hear that not smoking people's lungs are clean, but smoking people's lungs are black. Once you begin to smoke, it takes several years to return to healthy lung again. And generally speaking, people who smoke tend to become lung cancer. To make matters worse, not smoking people may become disease by passive smoking. Especially, it is not good for children's health. That is to say, smoking is bad for not only smoking people bad also not smoking people. That is why, smoking is banned at the all restaurant. Smoking people should consider people who hate smoke. I think that all people, from children to old people, enjoy dinner and talking at the restaurant.",B1.1
" In the context of Singapore, smoking is still considered a taboo because of the negative side effects it brings --- health problems and second-hand smoke. Non-smokers typically resent the presence of unpleasant smell of smoke possibly containing carcinogens. Smoking in enclosed areas such as restaurants destroys the ambience of the restaurant and dining becomes a chore. In order to not exclude smokers, some restaurants have allocated designated open-air corners so that smokers can still smoke and dine at the restaurant without polluting the air within the air-conditioned place. Bearing this concept in mind, smoking should not be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. However, we must note that the concept of having a non-smoking area is only possible if there is space for one. Smoking in enclosed restaurants will probably deter the non-smoking majority from dining there. Therefore, smoking should be banned for restaurants without smoking corners. On the other hand, smoking can be completely banned at all restaurants as a scheme the government can consider in order to reducing the number of smokers in the country. With reduced areas for smoking, smokers will find it more constrained and difficult to smoke as and when they like. In a totally utopian point of view, perhaps completely banning smoking at all restaurants could mark the start of a smoke-free country. (220 words) ",B1.2
"It is a caution written on every packet of cigarette by the ministry of health. Almost every person knows how much a cigarette is injurious for health and in a long run how much it is going to effect a smoker physically. Even then almost 30% of world's population is addicted of this bad habit which is a big ratio. Today, when smoking is becoming a status symbol for the college students and teenagers they use to smoke outside in their private parties. On the other hand today parents are very well aware of after effects of this addiction and they restricts their children to do any this type of activity very strictly. As the result of this condition from the parents side youngsters use to go out and smoke in privacy with their friends in restaurants or cafe's where they could not be spotted by their elders, this trend is very common today. It is very famous saying that' nature cannot be changed' and it is also understood that a habit leads to one's nature. That means if today's child do smoke and not stopped will undoubtedly remain with this habit whole his life, at the end conclusion is that smoking of a person is not the problem of an individual but national or global so it should be banned every where outside like hotels and restaurants. In this way we can get rid of this very serious problem.",B1.1
"I think it shouldn't be completely banned. It should not completely but selectively banned. Above all, I am also a person who likes smoking after having some meals, finishing something, and having some coffee, but it is usually banned in most of restaurants except for pubs, or bar. It is certain that non-smokers don't want to be with smokers who are smoking, and indirect smoking is more harmful than direct smoking. I understand it as well. However, smoker's rights of smoking in public area also exist. Because cigarettes are also products which tobacco company wants to sell customer, and customers want to use it anywhere despite of in public area. Additionally, governments should provide them some smoking districts in public area, because taxes of cigarettes are so high. In other words, Heavy smokers are very sincere large taxpayer. So I'll suggest a solution. We divide the restaurants into two areas such as smoking area and non-smoking area. When smokers are with smokers in smoking area, they would feel comfortable if they smoke. It is the possible situation smokers don't like the smoking smell; however, they are more understandable than non-smokers. If we do like that, we didn't argue about this topic again. I think it is the best solution which is considering both smoker and non-smoker.",B2
Part time job is very common now a days. It is very beneficial for us In many way. The expenses of now a days is going very high. No can survive a good life a good or a charming life without money. Money is very useful and important for us. We can fulfill of desires without money so the person who has money in present he successful. The person who has money can get anything in the world. So the earning is very important for us. So part time job is very useful for us in many ways. If a student is doing part job can reduce their burden by earning money. They escape by wasting their time by doing their job. They used their positive efforts in a good task. From this way they can be independent. In this way we can also help our parents. We can reduce our financial problem in this way. Although it is very beneficial for everyone. But it is also have an disadvantage. Like student cannot give their proper concentration to their studies. In this way the burden of students become very high. Which can also cause their health disorders.

"The statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants is a good policy in theory, but in reality there are many people who go to restaurants to enjoy smoking and drinking while eating. Theses people make up a significant customer base for the food and beverage industry. I think that what law makers should do is pass the responsibility of protecting nonsmoking customers onto the restaurant owners. One way to do this is by charging higher taxes to restaurants with poor ventilation systems or without a barrier separation between smoking and nonsmoking sections. I believe that if the restaurant has taken reasonable steps to separate the smokers from non-smokers, then they have done their job to make sure that all customers have a comfortable dining experience. Instead of banning smoking, another way to stem the smoking vs. nonsmoking controversy is to increase in the number of non-smoking restaurants and cafes. At this time many popular cafes, such as Starbucks have had tremendous success with promoting a smoke free environment inside the cafe. As the nonsmoking culture becomes increasingly popular, smokers will find a ways to curb their smoking appetites while dining. Overall, the best way to solve this situation is to give customers a choice.",C2
"I agree with this opinion. At first, smoking is harmful for people. Passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking. So smokers bother many non-smokers. Secondly, the smell of tobacco is very strong. And once clothes absorb the smell, it is difficult to remove the smell. It is an offensive smell for non-smokers. When I went a restaurant and sat down smoking seats, my clothes absorb the smell in spite of nobody smoking. The other day, I had another terrible experience. I sat down no-smoking seats, but smoke came from smoking seats. And I felt very bad. Smoke spoiled dishes and clothes. I went back home and wash my clothes immediately. It was very unfortunate day. Regardless of the separation of smoking seats and no smoking seats, smoke bothers people. So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. There is no merit of smoking. Smoke spoils tastes of foods. Cook don't want this result. In order to enjoy meals, smoking should be banned. I don't understand significance of smoking. Do smokers smoke for relaxation? It is better to find an alternative way of relaxation. Nobody benefits from smoking. Smoking should be banned at not only restaurant but also all public space in Japan.",B1.1

Returant is a place where people for some time relax and make themselves fresh but now a days smoking has created very bad effect on restaurant that instead of feeling good people sometime gets irritate in the pollutant atmosphere due to smokers so smoking should be banned everywhere especially at all students. First Government should take steps for solution of this problem and then and then restaurant owner should make their effort and people individiualy should avoid from smoking that is creat many harmful disease like cancer etc. Becauce of the government action restrants can be free from smoking to some extent because when people themselves do not put effort Government cannot do something. Returant should banned smokers there because this is not fear for their buseniss apart from visitors. With the combination of every individual a society is formal. So people should remove this bad habit that is very dangerous for their future and family. Smoking creat pollution and make the environment dirt for other person as well.

"Working part time in college is very important for many college students, I think. I think this because I have worked part time since I came to college, and it has given me a variety of good things. For example, I have been able to make a little bit of money for the weekends and other times. I can also use this money to help pay for my text books which my parents do not want to pay for. Next, I have been able to become smarter by working at my current part-time job. I have learned how to manage and maintain a computer system through my internship, and this is valuable experience that I could definitely use to help me find a real time job. This is just what I would like to be doing when I graduate, so unlike some students who work their part-time jobs at restaurants or other places, I am definitely not wasting my time. The one bad thing, however, is that as expected, I do sometimes have some problems balancing my school and work life. Really the biggest problem is that you meet new people at work and you can develop a new social circle there as well, and it is hard to have two main activities that you need to be doing (school and work) as well as two social circles which need your attention.",C2
"As a college student, we have more time which we can totally handle on our own than before. It is maybe the first time they live without their parent and have the own power of their own life. Some may want to get a part-time job to earn more money for luxury items or something else they want. To my perspective, it is great to get more life experience through the job. What's more. If students have their career experience when they are still young, they will be more skillful for the future time. And they will know how hard it is to earn life; it will be time to appreciate what they get from their parents. To the perspective of a corporation, they will get a more mature staff compared to who do not have any work experience. People who love work and strive during the working time will be fine. But for students, learning is what they should put on the first priority. If they just work all the time and abandon their study, it is like put the cart before the horse. No enterprise will hire a college student who did not finish his education. Students can only have a part-time job when they have free time.",B1.1
"It is very popular habit through out the world. People of every corner of the world like it, smoke it and even chew it. Even men, women and even children are addicted to it. The history of smoking was started as early as 5000 BC in shamanistic rituals. With the arrivals of the Europeans in the 16th century, the consumption, cultivation, and trading of tobacco was quickly spread. Tobacco is most commonly used for smoking. It is smoked, inhaled and even chewed. Initially it was used for medical purposes in the form of hookah. For gas troubling patients, Doctor suggest them hookah. But the passage of time it spread and the other people also strat using it in the form of cigarette Smoking has many dangerous effects on human health. It produce different disease in the smoker such as heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cancer (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer). Cigarette smoking is also the number one cause of bladder cancer. It is said that daily about 3, 900 kids between the ages 12 and 17 start smoking. The number of smokers is increasing daily due to large advertisement by cigarette producing companies. The world Health organization (WHO) should took step of it and should banned on all cigarette producing companies.",B1.2
"In the Philippines, almost one-third of the population is composed of marginalized citizens. This group of people live in the slums and they don't have sufficient income to pay off their living expenses such as food and even the education of their youth. As a result, marginalized children only had the opportunity to complete their primary education in public schools. These children don't have the chance to pursue their dreams further because there are only a few public universities or colleges in the country. That's why it is significant for these students to have a part-time job. Part-time jobs offer a number of benefits to college students. On one hand, college is considered to have the priciest cost in terms of tuition fees in the country. Thus, in order to help lessen the expenses of the supporter of the student, this undergraduate should engage in part-time jobs. Even though part-time workers don't earn a lot of money, at least there's a reasonable amount that can subsidize the student's expenses such as school projects. On the other hand, part-time jobs give college students experience. Since college is supposedly the preparatory period before engaging in a profession, the experience that the students get from part-time jobs help them visualize the different workloads they might encounter after they graduate. Therefore, these students gain more knowledge hands-on. Some students might regard part-time jobs as a waste of time and a hindrance from concentrating in their studies, but in reality, part-time jobs are just what college students need in order to be prepared on the kind of labour that awaits them after they graduate.",B1.2
"Part time job is becoming the need of the peoples because of the raising prices of every thing which is needed to a human. Specially country like Pakistan part time job is becoming the need of peoples to fight against the poverty. An average worker of any organization which have a big family can't survive in the society without of part time job. In our country man is supposed to fulfill the needs of his family, and it is commonly observed that if there is five to six members in a family there is only one person who is working to fulfill the needs of whole family, so it is not easy to a person who have salary ten to fifteen thousand to fulfill the basic needs of his family members with out having a part time job. On the other hand students also do it, to pay there fee and to manage their selves. Part time job affects a lot. Part time job is need based. It is physically and mentally extortion. Tuitions create a lot of mental tension for students, while other clerical work creates also tension physically and mentally. Part time job should be done as one needs it.",A2
"In modern sociaty, more and more people go to the restaurants instead of having meals at home. So it is important for us to choice the restaurants. For example, the hygience of restaurants and price, distance... so on. Most importantly to me is that smoking should be banned in restaurants or the restaurants have no smoking region. Smoking in the restaurants is very impolite and disrespect to people who eat in the restaurants. Everyone knows smoking is unhealthy to body. The restaurants are public areas so smoking should be banned completely. Smoke will through air condition spread in all the restaurant. Second-hand smoke is also unhealthy to people. If people want to smoking in the restaurants, we should suggest them not to do it and thy can smoking in outside. Smoking people have to respect other people in the restaurants. I think our government must promote not smoking in the restaurants and make law to ban smoking in the restaurants. If some people are illegal, we should punish them by fined. After all, smoking brins out second-hand smoke and unconfortance to people and teir health. Even though, I eat at restaurants beside smoking people, I'll feel not good and unhappy. Most people don't like smoke so it is essencial to ban smoking in the restaurants. All I want is have good time in the restaurants",B1.1
" It is not compulsory for college students to take a part-time job but I think if possible, the school should encourages its students to actively search for internship opportunities and prepare themselves for their career. It is true that study is the basic task of a college student, but there is certain knowledge and skills that can only be learned better through the real working experiences. All these skills will prepare the students better for their future career. If the part-time job is related to the field of study of the students, then the hands-on experience will reinforce the knowledge learned in the textbook. So with proper time management, the college students should be encouraged to take a part-time job. However, the scope and time requirement of the part-time job have to be taken into consideration when the students choose their part-time jobs. The purpose of doing part-time job is to help students gain working experience; if by doing part-time job, students are not able to manage their academy well, then doing part-time job perhaps is not the best choice for the students at this moment. It is best that the college supports this working scheme by actively sourcing suitable employers and companies to provide jobs for students. Not only the students will gain from the working experience, the school would also be more socially involved as an education institution. ",B1.2
"I feel that having a part-time job for college students can have both its benefits and disadvantages. For example, having a part-time job trains the student to manage his or her time well, as well as to prioritise his or her duties. The student can also learn how to multi-task, a skill which can be advantageous when he or she starts to work. In addition, the part-time job may be relevant to the field of work that the student is interested in when he or she graduates. Internships will be an example. It allows the student to learn and apply his knowledge according to what has been taught in school. In addition, having a part-time job also means that the student is able to earn extra allowance and learn how to appreciate money instead of depending on the allowance given by parents. There are drawbacks for college students to have a part-time job as well. Firstly, the student may not be good in managing his or her time well. If the student cannot juggle between studies and the part-time job at the same time, he or she will end up doing badly in both the job and school. It is important to note that not all college students are bad in managing their time. Perhaps, having a part-time job will train the student to learn how to juggle his time well and this will not lead to an imbalance between studies and work. To conclude, I feel that having a part-time job is not necessarily important for college students. It has its advantages and disadvantages but it all boils down to how the student is able to manage his or her time well. ",B2
"Recently, more and more college students have a part time job when their time is vacant. I partly support that it is important for college students to have a part time job. In my opinion, college students become more independent and have more free time. Some college students spend a lot of time in online games. Instead of this, students could look for a part time job. It can make most use of their time and their lives could be more interesting. Finding a part time job can also let us know the difficulties from employment and adapt ourselves to society. And when we are working, we can learn some special skills and knowledge which we are not able to get access to in our college. We could develop our ability through the part-time job. For example, we can become considerable and careful if we take a job as a waiter or waitress. Personally speaking, as college students, we should try to get into the society around us, because we become adults at the same time. So there is no doubt that taking a part job is a shortcut. We can gain some unforgettable experience form it. So if you have time, try to look for a part-time job.",B1.1
"Yes, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. At the first place smoking must be forbidden or banned in the country. Smoking doesn't help, smoking cannot bear benefits instead it causes danger to health or in other worse case scenarios death to the smoker. It has become fashionable in the world today to condemn smoking. However, smoking is still dangerous to one's health and people around them, the smoker. I admit that cigarettes companies are the major contributors or large tax payers it helps our country but we suffer worse than we benefit. As 15 years old non smoker college student I have the perspective of a bad side of smoking. I am not fascinated by the benefit of smoking which is relaxation, how would you relax if your body is collapsing due to harmful or dangerous substances inside a single stick of cigarette. Smoking kills, Smoking causes cancer, second hand smoke is dangerous. Now, is there any major reason to contradict my allegations towards this smoking ban topic? Thus, Smoking must be banned at all restaurants in the country. It must be banned due to dangerous fruits to the people who use it and people around a smoker.",B1.2
"There are two types of jobs. One a full time and other is part time job. A man who is doing full time job do his duty all the day but a man who is doing part time job his duty is for the short time. A part time worker can do his job in the morning or in the evening or some time in the night. Most of the people do it in the night. In this world every thing is very much costly. Prices of every thing is sky high. The rent of houses and the bill of electricity, and telephone and gas is very high amount. In this world every one needs extra money. For this purpose they do part time job, they reduce and relax the burden of the whole family. The relax the burden of the only one family member who is the earner of the family. Students do part time job because they want to share their income with their father so that he may easily pay the fee of his son. The low backward area is also factor of the part time job. So those people who have low income monthly or daily they part time doing mostly. It is a good thing but Pakistan is not its roger.",B1.1
"I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job, but I think it is important for some college students whose bursary is not enough. For someone who want to have a lot of experience of doing jobs I think it is good idea to have a part-time job because it get both experience and money, but it is not good idea to so serious with part-time that it effects studying. If whatever reason make you have part-time jobs, the important thing that you should remind yourself is My present main job is studying and you should divide your time properly. You should select the part-time jobs that don't make you more tire. The part-time jobs that you select should be in your free time and your time must transcend for studying outside class. Moreover, it is good if you get a part-time job that is compatible with your major. For me it is not important to have a part-time job. Because I think that the most important thing that I must pay most of my attention now is studying and I should my best with my studying to get a great job in the future. In term of experience, college let students have a period to practice the job when the students are in year 4 of studying. I will get the experience when I reach that time.",B1.2
"As is known to us all, many college students choose to take a part-time job in their spare time and this is a common phenomenon in our life. But here we need to talk about whether part-time job could actually do good to our college students. As far as I am concerned, I believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. First of all, when we take a job, we could get a chance to learn to be independent. In the same time, we can use this chance to try to get along with others. What is more, as result, we can also get our financial reward and work experience as well which may be helpful in our future life. Furthermore, to take a part-time job provides us with an important opportunity to put what we have learnt from books into practice. However, every coin has two sides. There are also some disadvantages. Firstly, some students may spend a lot of time doing part-time jobs so that they just neglect their studies and this will affect their studies as a result. Secondly, some students may be cheated by others, because they don't know how to take good care of themselves and how to distinguish between right and wrong. In a word, I agree that students should try to get a part-time job which could help them to know something about society, but they should keep a balance between job and study.",B1.1
" NO SMOKING, you can almost see it everywhere. As the technology develops smoking has been hated by more and more people. It has not been a simple of fashion but a enemy. Smoking is bad to your health, which I need not say. However, many people agree this point. But they have another idea that just smoke once will not make a big different to their health. I have to say that is true. But if you smoke once everyday, or even every half day, it can destroy your body easily and many people can not stop when they have smoked once. Keep away from cigarettes is not very hard if you have not smoked. But it is not easy to do so if you have smoked for a long time. But I hope that they can control themselves because it will also be bad for other people who do not smoke. Even they do not care about themselves, for other people, they should stop smoking. Wherever you are, smoking is not a good thing. Not only for yourself, but also for other people. I believe you can get a strong body and more friends if you do not smoke.",A2
"Yes, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs as extra income would be beneficial for the student as part of allowance or payment of school fees. In addition, at college, it is good that the student learns to become more independent and start to step out into the society to have a feel of what it is like to work in the society in future. Besides, the timetables of college students are planned and organised by them and they are able to plan and manage when they have the capacity and time to work. Also, college students have a long break before the start of each academic year, such a time would be wise to work and get extra income. However, if the student requires more attention at school, it is best that the student focuses at college as after all, the completion of a college degree holds an even higher importance than the part-time job. Also, if the college student is well-to-do and does not require extra income or allowance, he or she may choose not to do it. In addition, using the free time that they have at work, he or she may not be able to have their social interaction time with their family and friends which could be detrimental as family and contacts are both important. Then again, I still believe that having a part-time job is a good idea as there is no harm in acquiring more experience in life. ",B1.2
"Recently, in Japan many people got to know the risk and unnecessariness of smoking in society. Thus, I think it is necessary to ban from smoking at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons why I think so. Firstly, smell of dishes-sweet smell, sour smell and so on- is very important in restaurants. And the cigarette spoils a smell of the cooking. It is true that there is some person who wants to smoke while eating a dish or drinking liquor, but the smoking should be prohibited at the restaurant if we think about many other people. Secondly, the smoke of the cigarette may spoil equipment: for example, wallpaper or ornament in the restaurant. It is very wasteful if these things are very precious valuable things. Thirdly, the prohibition of smoking is a flow of the modern society. It becomes natural on a train and the platform. Or there are many places that you cannot smoke in the workplace. So it is thought that it is a matter of course to prohibit smoking at a restaurant. In conclusion, the smoking should be banned in all Japanese restaurants.",A2
"Is important for college students to have a part-time job? What the part-time job is so important for most college student? These are good questions for nowadays college students. In my opinion, I think the part-time job is very important for the college student for the following reasons. The first reason is that the student can learn the job experiences. About eighty to ninety percent of college in Taiwan when they graduated they should be find out their job. If they had the job experiences, it will be better than other who didn't have any job experience. And when the college student in the part-time job, they also learn something that don't teach in the class. I thought the second reason is that the college student can find out which job is suitable for him in his part-time job. Most students who didn't worked before after they graduated they will spend long time to find out what kind of job is suitable for him or whether they can have interest in the job. I think this is a very important, because most people just work for work or the money. If they are no interest in the job, not only is very tough for him, it also make lower the job appearance. And the college student if they have the part-time job, they will know which job is more suitable for them and it is also save the time to looking for the job when they graduate. In conclusion, I think the part-time job is so important for the college student for these two reasons, to get the experience and find out the job interest. For these two reasons, I strongly believe that the part-time job is benefit for the college student, and is good for their future job.",B1.1
"I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be banned at all of the restaurants because of following reasons: Banning smoking at all of the restaurants cannot stop people smoking at the public place which has more serious problems; the owner of the restaurant might have difficulties when customer smokes at the restaurant. Firstly, smoking at the restaurant shouldn't be banned because if smoking at the restaurant is banned, they would smoke the outside of the restaurant which has serious problems such as indirect harm toward people who don't smoke as much as smoking inside of the restaurant. Therefore it's no use banning smoking at all of the restaurants. The other reason for being disagree with the idea that smoking at the restaurant should be banned is that the owner of the restaurant would encounter difficulties if the customer smokes at the restaurant. Even if smoking at the restaurant is banned, some people might smoke at the restaurant. This situation would make the owner as well as other customers uncomfortable and persuading not to smoke would be difficult to the owner. Therefore it would be not beneficial to ban smoking for the owner of the restaurant. To conclude, I completely disagree with people who claim that smoking at all the restaurant should be banned due to Banning smoking at all of the restaurant cannot stop people smoking at the public place which has more serious problems; The owner of the restaurant might have difficulties when customer smoke at the restaurant. Some people would disagree with my opinion because smoking at the restaurant is harmful for people's health. It could be. But it would be better if the restaurants make sections for non-smoke people and for smoking people instead of banning. Therefore smoking at the restaurant shouldn't be banned.",B1.2
" From my point of view, I partly agree with the point that college student should have a part?time job. College is a very important step before enter the society. University and the society is very similar, you must learn some practical life skills in the university. But the fact is that you can't learn such skills in the textbooks in the university. I think in the university, we have more time to do something we really want to do, so why not try to seek for the chance, and do a part?time job? That will really benefit to us. Though a part?time job is not a official wok, it still quite difficult for those unexperienced. You will learn how to treat people, how to deal with the problems, also some troubles we have never met before. For us, it means enter the society ahead of time. It is beneficial. But everything has two sides, do a part?time job also has its disadvantage, if you can't balance the relation between study and work, it will influence your study After all, I think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages. So the college students should have a part?time job.",B1.1
"Probably each of us has experienced a situation, when we were sitting in a restaurant and someone near started to smoke a cigarette. We became unwillingly second-hand smokers. This is happening to me very often and every time I wish smoking would be banned in public places. Restaurant is a place for rest and not gets disturbed physically and mentally. If it got banned we can save ourselves from a number of diseases, can have a reasonable environment which is suitable for families in restaurants. Smoking in restaurants is a disruption to everyone's meal, not just the smokers. The dividers that restaurants owners provide do not keep the smoke from spreading to non-smoking areas. Ventilation along with dividers may be a way to solve the smoke problem. A lot of people argue that smokers have their rights and that we live in a democratic country, where everyone can do whatever he wants as far as he does not break the laws. According to these people legalization of a law, which prohibits smoking in public places is against the personal rights of the smokers. After all, they are not violating the rights of the others, because the non-smokers can leave whenever they want. But would it not be more reasonable for the smoker to leave when they want to smoke a cigarette? In my opinion it would, because the smoker wants to do something that limits the people around him and not vice versa. It is known that smoking is unhealthy and causes cancer. But not many people try to stop the spreading of it. In conclusion I would say that many smokers gradually give up smoking if they have to overcome complex obstacles each time when they want to light a cigarette. Consequently, banning smoking in public places leads to decrease of smoking generally and especially of young generation. Better health and lower medical cost are the results.",B1.1

We often find many people who do not have a job, they will be difficult to find something to eat for their life and maybe for their families. That is why job is the most important thing to have for someone who wants to continue the life. I agree strongly for the college students to have a part time job, because it will make the students be theirselves and will not depend on their parents, their families, and the others, at least they can help their parents in finding the money. Beside of this, if the college students had have the job, they will get more experiences. Because the college students will get more experiences and sciences not in the class, but out of the class. In the class we just get the formula or the manner. But the main point is that we can apply what we have got from the lecture.

"When teenagers were high school students, they have less responsibility, less self-dependency, and they are still living in their comfort zone. Therefore, as soon as they step into college life, they have stepped into adulthood as well. As an adult, they have to be independent, able to take care of themselves, and take bigger responsibility for their own life. That is why college students should have a part time job. There are three reasons why they should have a part time job; to learn to not be dependent on one's parents, to be able to work, and to learn to have their responsibility as an adult. First of all, by taking a part time job, high school students who just turned into college students can be independent and learn to not lean on their parents anymore since they will part from them later on. Second, by taking a part time job, they can learn about working and earning money. Although part time job is a small job, but it can give them a picture of how working world is and how they make a living through it so that later when they are working in a company or starting their own business, they already know how to adapt and what to do. Lastly, through the part time job, they can learn on how to be responsible to themselves, by doing their work properly, and to others who are related to the part time job, the costumers, the managers, and co-workers.

"I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. If they want to make a law about smoking, it should not be way to ban smoking in all restaurants. Maybe it is better to ban smoking places but not in restaurants. What's the point of it? It is normal for some people to smoke after eating. Smoking is normal for many people nowadays I also mean that it is a free will to smoke or not. No one can stop a person for being being a smoker especially if it is his or her choice. I know that smoking is bad for one's health but who do you think you are to reprimand a person who smokes, right? It's none of your business anymore. You can do whatever you want but you should always be ready for the consequences. Smoking can cause a lot of complication to a person especially if that person is a heavy smoker. For me, you should always think twice in making every decision in your life. If you choose to smoke then be it, but be ready for what will happen to you. But just to clarify, I am not an anti-smoking person. Every person has their own life which cannot be controlled by any person except for their own-self. 220",B1.2

"Now a considerable number of people(including some teenages)smoke, and many smoke heavily although they admit smoking do harm to their health. And it's bad not only for themselves, but everyone around them----According to a research, only 20% of harmful substance is taken up by smokers, and the other 80% is absorbed by individuals around them, thus an interesting noun is created: second hand smoking, meaning that people absorb smokes although they don't actually smoke. It is unfair indeed, and more than that, when you smell someone smoke in a restaurant, the unpleasant feeling may reduce your eppetite heavily----the restaurant manage won't be happy, too. Because they sell less food!Also, it's bad for smokers:they get more chances to smoke, and the more they smoke, the worse their health will be, and the greater desire they will have, making it more difficult to quit smoking. Some restaurants set a smoking area which is used by smokers only, but the problem is that smoke isn't solid standing stablely at one place, thus the situation won't change radically. So it's high time to ban smoking, especially in restaurants. Scientists tell us it's possible to quit smoking, all the smokers need is a strong mind and supervision. If all restaurants banned smoking with a firm hand, the number of smokers would be sharply reduced, and benefits would be amazing:an ocean of money would be saved, and the saved money could be invested to more meaningful areas such as education and health care;people would be heathier, and public health system would have lighter burden;air condition would change better as well as rubbish would be less; there would be less robbers and our society would be more harmonious....

"I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is bad for the health. Smoking harms not only smoker's health but also another person's health. So the Japanese government is beginning to prohibit smoking. For example, school teachers are prohibited smoking inside an elementary school and a junior high school. When I was a junior high school student, school teachers are prohibited smoking not only inside buildings of school but also inside the others. In America, the state governments imposed a high tax on the cigarettes so that smokers try to give up smoking. As a result, the price of cigarettes rose and was more than 1, 000 yen, but the policy was effective in giving up smoking. Therefore smoking is considered to be bad for the health in a lot of countries and many governments begin to adopt a policy to smoking. There is another reason why I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In Japan, there are seats in the smoking section and nonsmoking seats in restaurants. But each seat doesn't completely be divided because we can't separate the air in seats in the smoking section from the air in nonsmoking seats. So people who sit a nonsmoking seat breathe in smoke of cigarette. Therefore I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",A2
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smokers should not smoke in the restaurant because restaurants are public places, and at the same time to show respect to people who do not smoke. The smoke produced from cigarettes not only smells bad but also hurts other people's health. What's worse, it is difficult for non-smokers to not inhale the smoke produced from smoking since the smoke is all in the air as soon as it is produced. Even if there are smoking areas or rooms in the restaurants, the smoke may still come outside the areas or rooms and be inhaled by other people. Moreover, since there are more non-smokers than smokers, I think it is not reasonable to ask non-smokers to wear masks. So the smokers should take the responsibility to protect non-smokers from inhaling the smoke and stop smoking in public. Besides, banning smoking at all restaurants may help smokers quit smoking, which can help reducing smoking population and somehow prevent diseases related to smoking. Therefore, I think it is a good idea to ban smoking at all restaurants in the country to protect non-smokers from possible health damages caused by smoke.",B1.2
"All of people hope to get a good job in the future. Of course, I think this topic may depend on people aptitudes. From my point of view, there are many aptitudes for people to get the good job, especially ""Is a part-time job important for college students?"" the first reason that is important for college students, because some families have a few budget to support their children to school and university. So the college students have to work for getting more money to support themselves. The second reason is, whenever students have to use more money, but they would not like to disturb their parents they can earn some money by themselves by taking part-time job. The third reason, if the would like to pay their time effectively they can take apart-time job. Beside they pay their times efficiently, they also fun with their job. The fourth reason, part-time job makes students being really proud to gain new experience and earn much money by themselves. For the last reason, part time job can be a thing that makes students have great responsibilities, such as punctuality, being honest and relationship with other people. To sum up, I would not like to focus on ""part time job is important or unimportant for college students, but if students take a part time job while they are studying, they can learn the true meaning of responsibilities.",A2
"Smoking in restaurants must be banned because banned for many reasons despite that it makes you look more sociable and more elite, then it is not a good reason for letting you smoke in a restaurant. It should also be banned because they are being selfish because it's not only their air but also our air. The owner of the restaurant must have his or her own foresight about the restaurant he or she wants to have, from ones satisfaction to one's pleasure and desires. Also, based on my research, the article directly says, However, new evidence shows that second hand smoke is more dangerous to smokers than first thought. A new study was done by the Environmental Health on smokers, who had to smoke in enclosed places. (Source: http://voices. yahoo. com/second-hand-smoke-more-dangerous-smokers-than-5442447. html (11/10/12; 17:02)) They are not just harming themselves, but they're also harming the people around them. Smoking may make you look more sociable and elite, but has it ever come to your ind that there are also other people around you? Smoking may be just for yourself, but have you wondered or crossed your mind about the harm you are bringing to your dear non-smoking companions when you smoke with them? I think smoking must not only be banned in restaurants, but it should also have a high tax around 110% of its original price because despite that it is not healthy, it is also contributing to the worlds litters, pollution and additional destruction of the Philippine streets and environment.",B1.2
" In many public places, you can see signs of ""no smoking on the wall. Because restaurants are one of the public places too, of course, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants.

We stand pain when we fall ill, apart from this, in order to treat the illness; we spend money like water. It adds to the mental strain and financial burden on our family. When you smoke in the restaurants, people who don't like smoking have to bear the terrible smoke around you. Their health will be affected too by the smoke. You have no right to do so. In addition, smoking is one of the reasons that cause fire. There are many cases about fire disaster in restaurants every year. A part of the cases are caused by smoker. They throw cigarette ends and ash inappropriately. At last, by coincidence, fire breaks out. In the accidental there are the results of inevitable. If every smoker is careful enough and obeys the rules, fire disaster would reduce. In a word, smoking should be banned at restaurants as well as in other public places. It's good for everyone!

"It shouldn't be banned, but it should be controlled. Banning smoking in all restaurants in Japan would be over-regulating in my opinion. Governments already have too much control over what citizens do all around the world. You have to draw the line somewhere or all democracies will deteriorate into communist states which would be detrimental to all. Let business owners and private citizens decide as far as the restaurants go and allow the people to have some free will and a say in how they run their lives and businesses. Most of the restaurants that I have been in do smell a bit smoky because of crappy ventilation. If they could divide the customers into different, partitioned sections with good extraction fans, I think that would be enough for most non smokers. I am not a smoker and as much as I don't like the smell, I don't believe that I should be enforcing my will on to everybody else and no government should either. I think that they would be really stepping over the line if they want to discriminate in the so called interests of everyone's health. Keep it fair for all I say and just have a bunch of good extraction fans.",C2

Smoking not only causes problems to smoker but also to innocence people. Many people die every year because of smoking. However, smoking still becomes popular until today. Today, the rate of smokers is increasing. We can find them anywhere even in restaurants. They are harming people's life. They can't stop because smoking is like a drug addict. In restaurant, people want fresh air to breathe when they eat. Person that smokes in restaurant has no manner. We can only hope that there will be a decreasing of smokers. Stop-smoking campaigns as we see today can decrease a little. If we want to decrease the amount of smokers, we should help together. Smoking should be banned at every place not only restaurants. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is impossible to make people stop smoking. This world will be better and many people will be healthier if we can decrease the amount of smokers. Finally, smoking will harm yourself and other people if you don't stop now.",B1.2

Many college students do because they need money or income to fill the void of activity, employment in accordance with the hobby. For the student, obviously the answer is to revenues during the lecture, students do not want to overburden parents with only ask for money from parents.

We realize that we should use the money for what we really need. And we use things which we bought with our own money long and safety. Second, we can meet a lot of people regardless of age and sex to have a part-time job. At work place, there are many people who have various kinds of back ground.

"Earning while studying is a good thing but not all students are capable of working while exploring and developing their knowledge. There are advantages and disadvantages, some barriers that hinder us and of course there are some factors to be considered before deciding to have a part time job.

Having a part time job while you're in college will lessen your parents ' expenses, to be independent in an early age, to gain unforgettable experiences while working and also it will help you to be competitive. Those are some of the advantages of working while studying. When there are benefits that you can get from something of course there are also some disadvantages and those are as follows: you'll probably had a conflict with your schedule and time, there are also possibilities that you cannot study well after work because you are tired and it might cause you to be prone in accidents or robbery especially when you are working on the night time. Before entering into a work, still, you are a student so you must have the consent of your parents, they must agree. That's one of the reasons why college student that likes to have a part time job cannot do what they want. We must also think first if we can really do two things at the same time, if we really like what we are doing and if that we make us a better person.

Many student at my college have a cigarette, and when I connect wi-fi at the ground floor they whiff their cigarette. What can I doing? I just sit and play music from my notebook and absolutely start to collect information from the internet. Cigarette is number one industry that made money in Indonesia, many people in Indonesia like cigarette, their mind is like full of'cigarette', after they do something, they always 'turn on' their cigarette.

"As far as I'm concerned, doing part-time jobs is not only important but necessary for college students. The reasons are as followed. First of all, most college students are not teenagers but adults, therefore, they shouldn't depend all on their parents. On the other hand, the expenses of studying in colleges are much larger than that of studying in high schools. Don't you think that we should do something to reduce the burden on our parents? Doing part-time jobs is a good way to help us. Then, considering that the experiences of real society will benefit the college students a lot when hunting for jobs, part-time jobs, and part-time jobs is important. By taking a major-related part-time job, students can not only improve their academic studied but gain much experience that they will never get from the textbooks. The students who do part-time jobs have more opportunities to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced up with a wider variety of problems to solve, which will teach the students a lot about the real society. As we all know, the life is the best teacher in our life. At last, some people say that the students may have the enough time to do study and jobs at the same time. In fact, take my experience for example; the college students have a lot of time after the study and many people kill the time by playing computer games. Why don't we spend the time doing some jobs? To conclude, I think that doing part-jobs is very important for college students. There is no doubt that the jobs will bring us many benefits in many ways.",A2

Secondhand smoking enforces a law and if someone smoking will be punished by law. But Restaurant and public places make smoking room for smoker. Smoking was banned in public areas mostly because of passive smoking affecting others. The city already holds designated smoking zones to separate smokers in some public spaces. If I am near a smoker, it's like I am smoking, too Also, if anyone smokes cigarettes, try to stay away from them while they are smoking. Smoking damages your health.

"I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. Because there are some faults. I would like to write about them. Firstly it ignores human rights of smokers. Smoking surely causes harm to people in surround. But smokers have right of smoking. It is no good that we one-sidedly force our opinions. Secondly managers of restaurants lose the revenue by ban the smoking. Because banning the smoking prevent guests of smoker go to the restaurant. So the number of guests decreases and the revenue also decreases. Thirdly restaurant is precisely the place where guest comfortably enjoys eating. For smokers it is necessary to smoking to have a good time. Therefore banning smoking is equal with disturbing smokers' right of enjoying. Finally banning smoking treats nonsmoker well and treats smokers coldly. This is a kind of discrimination. Even kids know that discrimination is bad. It pays attention to only nonsmokers. For such reason, I oppose banning smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. But I agree with placing some nonsmoking seats, because it reflects nonsmokers' rights. This way brings equality between smoker and nonsmoker. However, it is not probably best way. I would like to study deeply and find the better way.",A2
"I strongly agree with this statement. Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. I have reasons to support why it should be banned. Firstly, smoking is not good for smoker's health. Moreover, it is not either good for people who are around smoker. Smoking can cause cancer such as lung cancer, many diseases and it will make you look older than it should be. There are many people in restaurant, and they can smell smoke from smoker. Second, smoke is smelly. Its smell could trouble another people who do not smoke. When they are eating food, they should be eating happily, but when they smell smoking, it could make them cannot eat anymore. Therefore, it is not good to smoke in restaurant. It is dangerous for smoker's health and another people who around smoker. It is cause of cancer. Smoking can disturb another people who are eating food and make them do not want to eat any food. Therefore, if you want to smoke you should smoke in another place not in restaurant. The restaurant is not the place for smoking. It is a place for eating and enjoys meal. Therefore, it is better if smoking in restaurant is completely banned.",B1.1

For many college students, there are much more time for them to spare. Having a part-time is a good choice. College students can get experience and information about employment by having different jobs. For example, if you have a part-time job as a waiter, you may meet different kinds of people, you can learn the best way of communicating with people surrounding you.

Beyond paying for schooling itself, it is important for people to have spending money for activities and entertainment so that one can stay sane when the pressures of education become heavy. College student part time jobs offer one both a way to stay ahead of the bills that add up during the school year as well as help maintain a healthy social life. There are a number of different options for college student part time jobs, many of which offer great options for earning extra cash while still providing flexible schedules. According to Next Path, an educational news resource, these range in hourly pay from just above minimum wage to three times as much. Plus, some offer extra downtime with which students can catch up on school work. Examples of the top part time jobs for college students include computer lab assistants, technology support specialists, administrative assistants, aerobic instructors, print center attendants, library assistants, bank tellers, hotel desk clerks and babysitters One of the best options for a part time job while someone is in college is a student worker program. Most colleges and universities offer opportunities for students to make money while working for a specific department or program on campus. Besides the financial benefit this provides to the student, it also has the extra bonus of allowing certain individuals the chance to learn additional facets of their chosen career path. Funding for student worker programs comes either from the federal government or the school itself, meaning students who get these opportunities generally have guaranteed employment through school",B1.2

"I think that a part-time job is important to university students. The reason why a part-time job is important is that we can experience various things and learn our view of life through experience of working. For example, I have a part-time job tutoring a high school student who is my friend's sister in mathematics and science. At first I thought it easy to teach her their subject because I was good at mathematics and science when I was a high school student. In addition, I was not serious since my student is my friend's sister. But I realized that I was wrong to think it easy to teach her when I visited my friend's home and taught her. I did not realize that thinking is different from real teaching until I taught her in practice. After I realized my mistakes, I learned difficulty of teaching others and responsibility to work through this experience. Other part-time job gives us valuable experience, too. That is why I think that we take responsibility for our action as a number of society through part-time jobs. And I think that studying is important when we are university student, but I think that having a part-time job may be important and valuable more than studying. So I want to go on trying to have a part-time job.",A2

These experiences will help us in the future for example it will be good weapons in job hunting. These experiences may also help us find new interests. It is said that today's Japanese college students are not able to find things which they want to do in the future so they may find that things if they do a part-time job. Second, in Japan it is said that college students have less lessons than junior high school students and high school students and have much more vacations, so they have a lot of spare time. It is chance to do a part-time job and earn much money. Then during the vacation, they are able to go a lot of places with their friends.

"I personally agree and find it distasteful to tolerate smoke when I am dining out and I am also fully conversant with the medical implications of all forms of smoking and all of the pros and cons. However on the surface, it would appear to be detrimental financially. The figures don't lie and there is bound to be some initial financial impact. Japan may appear to be better off by continuing to allow smoking in restaurants however, as I will point out later, this is not in fact the case at all. With Japan being one of the world's leading smoking nations, a ban would most definitely impact the economy and also restaurant profits. While studies have shown that initially, numbers increased when bans were introduced, over a longer period of time, there was an overall decrease in net profit right across the board. Be that as it may though and personal opinions and tastes aside, if Japan were to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the economy, they would discover that with the rising costs of health care and insurance, the cost of not banning smoking in both human value and financial value, would be far greater than not banning smoking.",C2
"About students have a part time job? University student have a part time job is not only important but also necessity. Most of the Korean University student have part time job, because the tuition is very expensive. They paid amount of money for the tuition.

"Smoking has been a serious problem for too long a period. In the whole countries, measures have been carried to prohibit smoking in many public places, such as restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, I'm definitely in favor of this rule. What has been taken into consideration in this rule is first and foremost the health of people. Smoking has been criticized for decades. As is so often pointed out, smoking for a long time is likely to resulted in lung cancer. However, there are certain quantities of people who just cannot give up the ""terrific"" feeling of taking a cigarette, even though they are clearly aware that they are risking their health. It's not other people's business if they only smoke alone, but when they're smoking in public places, especially restaurants, more concerns should be taken in. Numerous statistic shows that ""second-hand"" smoking is more harmful than smoking directly. Therefore, when a person is enjoying his cigarette in restaurants, where people may not able to stay away the smoking immediately, s/he is putting the people around her/him into danger, including those who never lay their hands on the cigarette. So, it is reasonable to ban this behavior which is in no regard of other people. In the second place, the smog and smell produced by the cigarette may make people feel uncomfortable. Usually, a popular restaurant is crowded with people, which has already declined the quality of the atmosphere in these places. If the smog given out by cigarettes adds to it, many people can barely step enjoy their dishes. Besides, the smell is also not pleasant to those who don't smoke at all. Take myself as an example, I can't help sneezing even by a slight smell of the burning cigarette. It's definitely a catastrophe to me if I have to put up with the smog during my dinner. In conclusion, I'm fully convinced that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the countries.",B2

"As an accountant, I believe that this is important and would go a long way towards improving student's financial education. Students can learn first hand, valuable financial skills such as budgeting, basic assets and liabilities assessment and the dollar value of compounding, as well as the implications that this can have on their financial futures. It is a great opportunity indeed, if they learn it, understand it and most importantly, apply it. I believe that students need to take a broader perspective when assessing the value of part-time jobs simply because it is more than just a little extra cash or immediate financial relief. I know from experience that while most colleges and financial institutions do teach sound financial basics, there are still many students who fail to understand the true power of numbers in the dollar sense. Further, I would say that there are many people who do learn sound money management but fail to develop true financial acumen which is more than just adding numbers, it is about investing prudently and having their investments work for them rather than them working for their investments. If students were taught true financial acumen and then learned to apply it much like'on the job training' with their earnings from part-time work, they would not only improve the quality of their own lives but if everyone also applied those principles, then it would surely give the economy a much needed boost.",C2

I think that studying hard is more important for students, but they need money even if they do not want which a part time job The student Does not appropriate the own allowance For University life In addition to university students in school will require a lot of things. There are two reasons why do I think a need part-time job First, the part-time jobs for students living a life support. For example, buying books and buying clothes, paying room rental, to enjoy leisure activities with friends will need to. Second, the social life in order is required. Get a lot of social knowledge and will learn how to live. And you have better major skills; you will probably have a perfect part time job. As a result, All the People are not equal but I recommend part time jobs for a University student. While doing part-time jobs, you will not waste your time. And fortunately you use major skills then you found part time job that increase your skills. It's a very good for your studying, knowledge and you earn the money. That's why we should have a part time job",B1.1
"I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking is a killer of the human. The killer is terrible not only because it will slowly take your live away but also you can not easily let it leave you alone. Many young man thought that smoking is a cool thing. Smoking let them feel like that they are adult and they can handle everything. But they don't know smoking is just a fast way to hurt their health! It is not wise to smoke because they want to be looked like they are brilliant. Another reason that I thought smoking is bad because the people who are hurt the most are not the smoker but people around the smoker. There is a study show that the family of the smoker is more easily to get cancer. This study tell us a fact that the things which would harm human's health are mostly be taken by people who around the smoker. Due to the reason above, especially the second reason, smoking not only harm yorself but also people around you. I think that is why at public places the smoker are banned to smoke, not to mention at the restaurants.",B1.1
"Smoking is a bad habit. The smokers not only ruin their lives but also of those around him. Smoking is injurious to health, we all hear that. But no one pay attention. Although the trend is reduind but still is a serious problem. The smokers, at restaurants smoke like the way they do usually. But they do not care about those sitting around. The people who dislike smoking and consider its hazards, when go to restaurant all their carefulness goes mvain. They protect their children from these hazards all their life. But at such public places like restaurants they do not know what to do. The smokers just tags if with them. They, being shy, can't request him to stop. The smoke spread by smoking contains a lot of harmful chemicals like nicotine. When someone breathes in such environment these chemicals are also in haled. Thus, who don't smoke but dislike it are also affected by its hazards. More ever, it is an immoral art on the whole. One should behave sansably at public places. He has his domain to rule. But he can't be permitted to play with the lives of others. Thus, smoking should be banned at public places especially at restaurants.",B1.2
"Restaurant are good place for people to take peace and happy. Restaurant is public place, people of ever mode earn went to restaurant to eat meal and enjoy. Pass time with happy from fore routine of every day life. But anywhere smoking is bad thing. It contain many disease like cancer etc. in restaurant people smoke and disturb the other people which have allergic with smoking. They pollutant the environment of restaurant. On other hand smoking cause serious problem for restaurant. For example there are laws in garden which are well decorated with light in high in one burn the smoke and threw the stick with fire on electricity which many cause serious damage. Smoking should be banned in restaurant. In many restaurant there are poster on which cigarettes is smoking is banned but people do not obey it and smoking continue. Now in these days smoking becomes a fashion. The boy of college makes party at restaurant. And smoking is good fun for them to enjoy this party. It not only disturbs the enjoyment of other family but the people of restaurant. And damage the restaurant. The people which disturb from this activity should not come again and in this way the level of restaurant become low and it became famous for smoking.",B1.2
"Smoking make human more relax and can forget his all problem temporary. But smoking have many negative effects for our body, for example related to cancer, lung disease, impotence, etc. and in the cigarette have a nicotine which make we always to try or consumption it. Advantage if we smoking, we can get or make good decided at we have a problem, because we have cold head. The statement about smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country is not solve the problem. That statement is confusing, because have not real action about smoking problem. I disagree with that statement, but I agree in other side. I disagree because I am smoking, and I agree because I am looking in healthy side. Government must make a smoking area, so if people want to smoke must in the smoking area. That is good solve about this problem. Nothing who is disadvantage with the solve from the government. Because we know that negative effect for passive smoker is more danger more than active smoker. For passive smoker you don't try smoking forever, because if you smoke at the first time, you will be active smoker. For active smoker if you want smoke don't smoking in universal place or you can smoke in the smoking area.",B1.1
"Nowadays, more and more college students choose to get a part-time job. Some students take a part-time job to enrich their college life. Some other students have a part-time job just because they want to get some money. Is it important for college students to have a part-time job?Personally, I think taking a part-time job is a good way to enrich our college life. We can learn a lot by doing this. And the working experience in turn will have great influence on us. Besides, we can also become independent by taking a part time job because we can earn money from doing part-time job. At the same time, we can reduce some family burden from our parents. But on the other hand, taking a part-time job may have bad effects on our study. Some students spend too much time doing part-time job and they don't have enough time for their study. So it is not very good for them. After all, study is the most important thing for us students. Having a part-time job has its advantages and disadvantages. And in my opinion, we can take a part-time job if it has little influence on our studying. So if you can keep the balance between your part-time job and your study, try to find a part-time job now.",B1.1
As many as forty percent man and eight percent women smoke regularly. Smoking is today to be the biggest dieses. The life of smoker is cut short 10-12 years and more then half of all Smokers die from smoking is a slow killer. It has become fashionable in the world today to condemns smoking so I do not thing it should be banned completely. A further point is that government's thought the world make huge pacifist from taxes of cigarettes. You can go for laser therapies or consume herbal tea. you must take carefully after your quit smoking. If you have any element you must meat to your physician and check if it because of quit smoking. For many year governments have tired to reduce smoking. but it not be successful to ban it completely. While there is no doubt smoking is very bad for you some are happy to continue. I don't think it should be banned through the legal system. it should be the choice of the restaurant go non smoking but at least a few would still keep on the tables. Some says that better yet the market at the very least there should be a Ban on all tobacco.,B1.1
"One day, every person in the world will facing the reality that they should go to work and earn some money to keep living. Even Money is not everything, People still need it for their own life. It is important for college students to have a part time job. It can help them to explore their own talent and make them ready to facing the business world. It could be any job, such as a restaurant waiter, salesman, even as an entrepreneur. Part time job is not like a full time job. Part time job have a shorter work time and also have less of money than full time job. Although they are not earn a lot of money, but they get an experience of a life time. It can make them become more mature and understand how hard working is. So they will never get easily spend their own money from now. Part time job also can help their parents to educate their character. Because every success person in the world start their successful from their own life character. Without any good Character, some one will easily fall down, even they are already in the top. So the best lesson from part time job is not how to earn a money, but an Experience of life that can make them tough, strong, and ready to facing the world.",B1.2
"I disagree with that statement. Of course I don't smoke because I am now still 19 and don't like smoking. I think recently, the number of the people smoking in a public place like load, station and so on. In a restaurant, there are often two rooms, smoking room and not smoking room. I really appreciate it and use not smoking room because I don't smoke. I think there are some troubles, but if smoking is banned more over, the people who smoke cannot go outside with smoking. But when I go to a restaurant with friends of mine who smoke, there occurs a trouble. I have to put up with smoking or they have to bear smoking. I think restraints should make a room where both of people who smoke and people not smoke can eat. For example, they make the machine which takes all smoke. It may cost a lot, but I hope it to be made. Also, the restaurant which all the rooms is for the people who smoke should be made because the room where people can smoke is restricted and the room where people can smoke without any hesitation is necessary. I understand that smoking is harmful, but people can choose whether to smoke or not smoke. As long as people can smoke, the room for smoking is necessary for smokers.",B1.1
"A part-time job is very important for the college students because studying only in the college doesn't enough for your life. You go to study for have a good job in the future when you graduated from the college. When you apply for the job, you should have many experiences and you are considered from the committees before who doesn't have many experiences same you. The experiences are many jobs that you do when you study in the college. Although, you will get money or not. The part-time jobs have inside and outside the college. When you do it, you will know and have many friends that inside or outside the college. You will have a big social.

Sometime you can save your money for buy something that you want to get. And save your money for the future. I agree with the part-time job is very important for the college students because it makes you have money for save or buy something and pay for study. And it very important when you apply for the job. You have many experiences with the jobs that you do when you study. You should to make your portfolio that performance your information and your works that you do. And finally, you should to find the part-time jobs to do and you will get many benefits from it.",B1.1
" University is filled with various of opportunities and students should grasp as many as possible chances to experience themselves and enrich themselves. So I can't agree more on that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, not only should college students gain knowledge from books and teachers, but also should abolish a lot from society. At the same time, they can gain much experience in many expects, from which they can benefits a lot for their future career. A part-time job makes a preparation for college students. Secondly, a part-time job can earn students a lot of money. During the course, college students can make a better understanding of that it is not easy to make a living alone. Also, they will understand their parents' hard work and learn to appreciate their happy life. At last, a part-time job can help students make a lot of friends, during which they can learn how to help others and experience the importance of teamwork. What's more ? Their friends may help them in the future. In brief, a part-time job can gain students a lot and help them harvest so much.",B1.1
"In Indonesia smoking is not forbidden for most of people and most place. People can smoke wherever they want in public. But in certain place, such as malls, restaurants, hospitals, and school forbid people to smoking. In my opinion, smoking in public places must be prohibited because of the disturbance they cause to others. The research says that passive smokers are 80% likely to suffer cancer than active smoker. After knowing the fact, people start to think how to overcome this kind of problems. For example, shopping centre usually provides smoking area for the smokers. Hospitals are strictly forbid smoking inside the hospital because can cause unfriendly environment and cause more bacterium and virus. Next the restaurant which will be explained more. I will divide the restaurant into three levels, the small scale, middle scale, and large scale restaurants. Small scale restaurants usually allow the customer to smoke inside the restaurant. They didn't separate the place for the customer who is smoking and who is not smoking. Middle scale restaurant such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds sometimes give the smoking area for the customer. For the example, they provide the outdoor seat for the customer who smokes. In this scale, usually after the customers enter the restaurant, they will be asked whether they smoke or not and will direct them to the smoking area if they smoke. For large scale restaurants, usually already forbid the smoking. They don't have the smoking area to prevent disturbance for other customer.",B1.2
"I think that we do not need smoking, but I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in Japan. First, if we ban to smoke at the restaurant, I think that people who like smoking will be poor. Though people who do not like smoking be poor too, I think that it is not a problem if restaurants make seats in the smoking section or a smoking room. For people who always smoke, if restaurants suddenly ban to smoke, they cannot deal with this opinion. Second, I think that the proceeds of restaurants will decrease if restaurants ban smoking. This is because all of the smokers do not want to go to the restaurants. I think that the number of smokers is not few, so they should not ban to smoking. Of course, needless to say, they must protest the location which people who do not smoke have. It is OK if we think both people. This is why, though we have to take people who do not like smoking into consideration, I think that we do not need to ban to smoke at the restaurants in Japan. We should protect the right of smoking there.",B1.1
"In our modern society, all too often we observe that a large number of people get into the habit of smoking at the restaurant; some of them are even students. And whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country? The answer varies greatly. Some people suppose, in some cases, it's very necessary and unavoidable to smoke at a restaurant, especially among business men when they do business. And many people think that smoking can also make people feel refreshed and relaxed after a long day at work. So they want to smoke when they are eating their meals in the restaurants. However, most people believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. One of the most common reasons is that smoking does harm to the health of both the smokers and nonsmokers, worst of all, it may cause the cancer and heart disease. And an individual who smokes a lot may not be popular among people around him just because of the unpleasant smell from his body. I am personally in favor of the ban of the smoking. Because it not only benefit our physical capacity but also save us a large amount of money.",B1.2
"Everyone must have known that smoking is very dangerous. It has given many bad effects to the smokers and people around them. Smoking could give both active smokers and passive smokers many diseases. It can grow cancer, and many other health problems. Smoking inside the room is very dangerous for passive smokers. Usually, passive smokers cover their nose or get out from that room as fast as possible. But, in some places like restaurant, we can't get out directly when there are people smoking near us. We eat in restaurant usually for a long time. If people near us smoking, it gives many people bad smoke. Smoke that produced from smoking is very dangerous for our health. If we inhale them in a long period, we could get serious health problems. People should think about others. They shouldn't smoke in front of other because it could give both active smokers and passive smokers many diseases. It can grow cancer, and many other health problems. If they themselves can't stop smoking in front others, I think restaurant should ban smoking for the sake of all people. Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. So, people who eat in that restaurant eat calmly.",B1.2
"I think smoking should be completely banned at all public places such as a restaurant, station, theater and college because cigarette smoke includes poison which is dangerous for people's health. And the people near smokers are also harmed by the poison of the cigarette smoke. I think there are three important things when the smoking problems are discussed. First, passive smoking has bad influence on our health. Moreover, it's more dangerous than smoking directly. Smokers might be prepared for the bad smoking influence and give up the idea of keeping their health. But passive smokers never think so. Most of them probably want to keep their health and enjoy their life for a long time. If a woman is pregnant, she should not smoke without question. And the people near her should pay attention to the situation of smoking. It is also dangerous for a baby to breath in the cigarette smoke. Second, habitual smoking needs a lot of money. So stopping smoking will solve the problem of a family budget. Now, the government in Japan plans a large increase in some kinds of taxes. If habitual smoking is improved, we might overcome such severe situation of a family budget. I think that stopping smoking is to family advantage. Third, heavy smokers, the people who smoke a lot every day, always have the risk of lung cancer. I have seen the picture of a lung suffered from nicotine. It showed that the lug turned from vivid pink to black by the influence of nicotine. The picture really shocked me. So, I don't smoke now and won't do in the future. After all, it doesn't profit us to smoke. Smoking harms both smokers and nonsmokers seriously. That is why smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants.",A2
"I always wonder that as smoking becomes a kind of food for some people, as cigarette is allowed in the country, why don't we set a smoking restaurant for such kind of people, in this way, they can enjoy their great meal every day, we can not be poisoned then. But in the real world, this doesn't happen, so smoking can't be some kind of food, or it is something that really does harm to us all. But why it isn't banned nowadays, and even there are so many no smoking signs in public places, some times we can still find so many cigarettes scatted and smoke flying everywhere, I can still that there isn't a god of cigarette, right? So that's not some kind of relief, just some addicted people. Smoking does no good to smokers, as well as people around him. The profile that so many cigarette companies and government get makes them by no means let this big cake fly away. No matter how far the way we still have to go to forbid smoking, at least, smoking should be banned in the restaurant now. However, smoking in the restaurant is not only harmful to people eating there, but also a worst significant, for if in a country, smoking can enjoy the same position as eating, smoking tumor will exit forever. I can't image that what may happen to the family happily eating there in the future. Maybe some time afterwards, another family will be damaged by smoking again. So for a better future, smoking should be banned in the restaurant, NOW!",B1.1
"Now part time job is one of the undivided part of college students. Many of college student take the part time job. They have so many reason to do the part time job. Some said that they want to be independent, not depend to their parents, especially to fulfill their needs in college. Some said that they want to have work experiences before they must work after graduation. In my personal opinion as a college student, what we must think first is our duty as a student. There are many of my friend that can't handle their duty as a college student. When they got income, they suddenly forget about their college. And it's affect to their scores, late to graduate, and spend a lot money. Most of them forget about their duty as a college student. But, am I really say that college student not allow to do part time job ? of course not. As I wrote above part time job also have benefits to the college student, work experience, become independent, etc. which is good. Part time job is also good solution for students that don't have enough money from their parents. But everything must in balance. We must know our duty first, as college student, so no question that you must do your task as college student very well. You can use part job as your advantage but not the most important. Do not let the trend to do part time job among your friends make you doubt, struggle, and in the end you'll make wrong decision.",B1.2
"Smoking is a habit. In which peoples take cigarette, hooka, and its smoke is inhaled in the body. And after some time exhaled from mouth or some time through the nose. And it is very dangerous.

It cause health problem and mental problem. It is also a wastage of money. Through smoking environment is also pollute. It is very dangerous. Many people dislike this habit. If the person smoke one time then it becomes its addictive. It causes very fatal disease. We should away from smoking. If we see the people who smoking then we should advise him to stop this and also tell him about its danger. Government is also play an important role for stopping this bad habit. They should also play some important advertisement for television on television for this.",B1.1

"In today's society, more and more college students have part time job after school. In my opinion, I support that teenagers have part time jobs in their free time and the reasons are as follows. First, I think that having a part time job can train the teenagers how to earn money and let them know that it is not an easy thing to make money. Then they will use their money more and more carefully. The second reason is that having a part time job, we will have the working experience. Having the working experience can help teenagers find their ideal job more easily in the future. And the teenagers can also learn how to deal with the problems that may happen in their future working circumstance. Third, teenagers can also expand their interpersonal relationship by having a part time job. In the recent year, interpersonal relationship has become the most important factor in our working environment. If we have a good relationship with our colleagues or friends, when we have problems or want other people to help us, they will try their best to help us. In summary, perhaps many people will think that having a part time job may affect our study, but I really think that having the part time job can help teenagers' future become much better.",B1.2
"To claim that something is important, it means to say that the thing is a priority in the individual's life. However, I feel that the main responsibility of a college student is to study, and not to earn money. Hence, I would refrain from saying that having a part-time job is necessarily important. Having a part-time job is only important in some scenarios. As college tuition can be very expensive, some students find themselves having to work part-time in order to pay for their college tuition. In this case, having a part-time job would be a priority to the individual, as without the salary earned from the part-time job, the individual would be unable to pay college tuition and attend college. However, while not important in most other cases, having a part-time job can still be beneficial. The salary earned from part-time jobs allows college students a certain amount of financial autonomy and teaches them independence. Besides, earning a little extra pocket money never hurts. College students who have to juggle both studies and part-time work are also trained to have good time management. This is a useful skill to learn in life. In addition, the part-time job contributes to the individual's work experience, and is a good chance for the individual to learn about workforce etiquette. In conclusion, having a part-time job is only important in some situations, not all. But even if not important, the individual might still want to consider taking up part-time work so long as one can cope with the demands of both studies and work due to the various benefits that one might stand to gain.

"Millions have died from smoking every year and it is a well-known fact. It is long proved that smoking not only harm themselves, but to others around them too. Exposing to second-hand smoke instead is more damaging than smoking itself. In Singapore, smoking in restaurants has already being banned. Not just restaurants, even in hawker centres and shopping centres only a designated area is allowed to smoke. Smokers on the other hand, think that this is against their rights and freedom. In my opinion however, yes, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants. Primary reason people visit the restaurants is to eat, not to smoke. We have to consider the various health issues. In a setting like restaurants with air-conditioning, smoke can plague and stink the whole place. Smoke can also trigger asthma and irritate throats. Food can become bland and smells from the smoke nearby. It is self-explanatory that restaurants can lose non-smoking customers as a result. Smoking in the public has already influence and encourage the young to smoke. If places such as restaurants and hawker centres also allow smoking to take place, the young will undoubtedly learn to smoke from the adults. Hence, in my honest opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and hawker centres. ",B2
"Smoking should be banned at all restaurant in the country because can make other people mood about food lose. If some people lose their mood about food they can't eat their food normally. After that they will not come to that restaurant some day if they meet the smoker in that place. The other reason is because the smoker can make other people sick some day. In fact the other people whose breath the smoke from the smoker has a big chance to have sick because of smoke. The sick because of smoke is like cancer, impotent, infect the lung, and the other kind if sick. Usually the restaurant which have smoker is little people will come. Or only the smokers will come to that restaurant. Because usually people will get out from the smoker when they eat something. Usually if the smoker come to restaurant they just drink and not eat that reduce the income of the restaurant. To make the smoker will not come to the restaurant they must give some notice that say no smoking area. Or they can give some notice about how dangerous of the smoking and the effect to other people importantly if they eat in the restaurant.",B1.2
"At the moment, many cities around world ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The new ban causes an intense debate among people. Some people especially the smoker protest the ban very much. They said that smoking is their own business, the ban influence their private right. They should smoke is their choice. Many smokers think smoke after dinner is very happy. So they don't like to stop smoke in the restaurants. Other people support the ban. They think that smoking is not only bad for smokers, but also harm to the other people around them. People want to have a clean place in the restaurant. They hate smell of smoke. Smoke will harm their health if sit very close to the smokers. From my perspective, smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. As we all know, there are many poisonous things in cigarettes. Many people find that these things can cause cancer and some other illnesses. When someone smoking it the restaurant, the people around them breathe the poisonous gas too, it can also cause cancer. It is true that smoking is people's own business, but they don't have the right to have effect on other people's health. In short, I support the ban for people's health.",B1.1

In my opinion, I think college should have a part-time job because when you get a job you will have a money then you could use the money by not disturb parent too much. When you do a part-time job you will get the many experiences that it will make you to be a good worker in the future. When you gradate and get the job.

If someone smokes in public area, people can be sick because of his or her cigarette, and, you know, second-hand smoking is more dangerous than voluntary smoking. Government must transfer expensive penalty to a person who smoke in public place. No smoking in public place is common sense in Europe. Therefore, is enforcing policy that transfer penalty in the Europe several countries. This policy can may reduce greatly the smoking rate in public place.",B1.1
"In my opinion, I agree that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country. There are many disadvantages of smoking. There are three reasons that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First, smoking destroys the lung. Second, smoking makes you have bad looking. Finally, smoking affects the bad effect to others. First, smoking destroys the lung. There is a nicotin that is included in the cigarettes. If you smoke everyday, the nicotin can be collected into your body. It can destroy your lung. Moreover, you will be cancer. Second, smoking makes you have bad looking. For example, if you always smoke everyday, you will have bad looking. You will have dark lip. You will have bad smell. Your skin will become yellow skin. There are many effects from smoking that make you have bad looking. Finally, smoking affects the bad effect to others. For example, if you smoke in your home everyday, the bad effects will not affect to only you. The bad effects will affect to your lover person such as your father and mother, your lover, or your son. They can be cancer although they do not smoke. Therefore, I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking has a lot of disadvantages to the smoker and others.",B1.1
"""Do not smoke in this area"" we often saw the message about this in every public place. For example in hospitals, schools, Univesity, resturants etc. It is a good banner way to stop the person who usually smoke in public area. I think the place that should be banned smoking is restaurants. Because it is a place that many people go there for relaxed. For example the older people, childent etc. the owner of erery restaurants should be taking care about this. This essay I would like to disscuse about should be banned smoke in restaurants or not. The restaurants is a public plase the everyone usually go ther. It dose not good if some person smoking in restaurants durring another people are eating food. Some people think restaurants is a relaxed place, everyone can do everything we want. But I think smoking in restaurants is a bad behavior. The person who smoke should be in smoking area. It is better than inside restaurants. Some restaurants also self cigarette for the customer. That way some people often smoke in restaurants that they have to go. The owen should pay respected with law banned smoking. If in the restaurants have no smoking area I think the owner should control the guest that want to smoke to go out side. because some women allergiy the tobacco smoke. Everyone will be happy and enjoy eating if the restaurant wihtout tobacco smoke. The restaurants owner should be serious about this. Because it is a service job and the customer go there for spending their relaxed time.",B1.1
"These days, as the zeal for children's education is getting higher, the interest in where to raise their children is increasing, too. However, I strongly believe that it is better for children to grow up in a big city. The city will benefit children with building their goals through diverse experiences and generous attitude toward others by friends from various backgrounds. First of all, children can set more specified dream through plenty of experiences. For example, there are a lot of exhibitions or cultural events held in the city. Due to the excellent transformation system which the city boasts of, they can go to those facilities without any burden. The easier approach to them will help the city's children broaden their knowledge and consequently, children can find their real interests earlier and easier. This is not just good for the children themselves. This also brings positive effect on the country. After the children in the city grow up, they can be socially important person. Second, due to the feature of the city, children can meet friends from diverse backgrounds which can lead the children to develop the flexibility in their social relationships. Originally, cities are made of people from all around the country. There are diverse kinds of person who has different life values and thinking styles. Growing up with them will naturally make the children more generous to the people who have different value and a broad minded person. In conclusion, I highly believe that a big city is better for children to be raised. Not only is it good for the educational aspect, but also it is beneficial for the personal aspect. Therefore, these are the most convincing reasons for my belief.",B1.2
"I agree with banning smoking in restaurants because it might negatively impact of the atmosphere in the restaurant. Besides, cigarette smoke makes no harm to the body that are the ones who smoke and those around. Causing many diseases have come followed such as cancer, heart attract. The shop should be held the policy or campaign for banning smoking. If all restaurants cooperate with each other, the number of smokers will drop down and all is gone at the end. In school, there should be a campaign also to teach students to not try to smoke. The teachers may show the pictures about people who got effects from smoking. Students may discuss how smoking is dangerous or how it harms people. They may discuss about advantages and disadvantages. Then they may see the results how less advantages they can think of smoking and how amount of effects from smoking they found. It is not only restaurants to decide to ban the smoking, the country should support them too. If the government support, it will be stronger and people will follow without argument. It is another suggestion to promote banning smoking in all restaurants. Someone should start this campaign as soon as possible.",A2
"Part time job for college students is somewhat sounds good for the students. One of the advantages is you are trained to manage your time as efficient as possible. You can also make an additional income for your needs, buy gadgets / things you like, or even pay your tuition fees yourself without the help of your parents. However, working part time is also has disadvantages. One of them is your time for studying or for doing the other teen's thing is decreased. As a student, you must prior your studies. Don't let working part time as your number one priority. You'll make your parents disappointed if your grades are bad. The affectivity of working part time is also depends on the motivation of the students, whether the part time job is related with their studying or not. Nowadays, most of the students are working part time only for find an income. They don't mind if the job doesn't related with their studies or not. As long as they got a lot of money and the job is quite easy, they'll take it. But, it is okay if they can manage their time. As a conclusion, I think that having part time job for college students is good, but I will more agree if the job is related with the studies because it gives us experience. In our teen's life, I think that gaining experience is much more important than gaining income.",B1.2
"Nowadays, there still exist many uncivilized behaviors in the public such as smoking, spitting, littering. Especially, I believe that smoking recklessly in the public both does harm to the health of people and to the environment. So, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in the public. The following reasons can be figured out to support the argument. Undoubtedly, banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there are less second hand smoking released into the air, so people have less chance to be exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, no smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good mood. This will obviously promote cultural and ideological progress by forbidding bad manners and developing good ones. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to the society, why not take it?All mentioned above tell us the advantages of the banning. It is time to take the advice of banning and to put special emphasis on the improvement public environment though it is a litter harsh to the smokers.",B1.1
"We all are living in a competitive world. The modern society requires us to be more experienced, more talented, and more professional. As stated in Darwin's theory of natural selection, the survival of the fittest still applies to our lives, no matter of our age or gender. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job at any time of their academic career, if they can, in order for them to experience as many things as possible. A part-time job allows one to be exposed to the environment of a real workplace. Students working as a cashier of a tiny bookstore or a waitress of a fancy restaurant have more knowledge about the working system in the bigger picture than students who are only regular customers. For instance, they can become familiar with the hierarchical structure of the workplace, manufacture and transportation of the goods and services, and most importantly, the value of earning money -- along with economic concepts, independence. Part-time jobs let college students learn many aspects of a working person, as mature adults. Moreover, people who work as students will be more prepared when any abrupt situations come up. One never knows how his or her life will turn out to be. It is always better to have experienced something previously because the chances of making the same mistake next time are slimmer and one can plan ahead for the next step. Besides, part-time jobs can provide valuable friendships; the people you meet as a college student part-time worker may be a great help in the future. In conclusion, the experience and social connections together are the best advantages that a student can get from part-time job. Learning a new thing is always a good thing. As young adults, college students should be encouraged to take any available part-time job opportunities, so that they will be more prepared for the competitive real society.",B1.2
"I agree with this statement that students in college should have a part-time job. However, I think that a college student should only have a part-time job if they can find one that relates to their major. It is kind of a waste of time to do anything that wouldn't really help you in graduating from college, and the fact of the matter is that if you can find a part-time job that is related to your major, you'll gain valuable experience and probably also make more money than you would at a job that is completely unrelated to your major. A part-time job gives you the opportunity to develop crucial skills like responsibility and money management while you're still young so that you will not have to worry about these after you graduate. You already have developed the skills to a point where they are nearly second nature, so you'll be miles ahead of the other students who are just beginning to discover these problems after they graduate. Lastly, a part-time job is a good thing to list on your resume because it shows that you were good enough at school to have enough time to engage in another pursuit.",C2
"Nowadays, more and more college students have a part-time job. Some work as tutors, some work as waiters or waitress in the restaurants; still others work at the convenience stores. They keep part-time jobs not only because it's a good opportunity to prepare for their future career plans but also help them save more money, and they can help their family or be financially independent from their family. In my opinion, however, I don't think it is important for college students to have a part time job. I don't mean that keep a job when they are still students is a bad thing, but I think it is not really necessary and primary. College is such a wonderful place where can preserve the students the advanced information, the diverse knowledge, and the rich learning resources. There are also many college activities which are as important as study that students must not miss. The knowledge, the ability, and the experience of joining activities are the invisible fortune that will help the students a lot in the future. If the college students have a part-time job, maybe they'll too busy to deal with their college stuffs. Keeping a part time job may gain some experience and money, but it possibly make the students lose the time to develop their knowledge and ability, which are more important for a student. For the reason, I think it is not really important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"There is not benefit. Ads for cigarettes were all over the place. Today we're more aware about how bad smoking is for our health. Smoking is restricted or banned in almost all public places and cigarette companies are no longer allowed to advertise on TV, radio, and in many magazines. Almost everyone knows that smoking causes cancer, emphysema, and heart disease; that it can shorten your life by 10 years or more; and that the habit can cost a smoker thousands of dollars a year. So how come people are still lighting up? The answer, in a word, is addiction. The consequences of this poisoning happen gradually. Over the long term, smoking leads people to develop health problems like heart disease, stroke, and many types of cancer. Smoking is a hard habit to break because tobacco contains nicotine, which is highly addictive. Like heroin or other addictive drugs, the body and mind quickly become so used to the nicotine in cigarettes that a person needs to have it just to feel normal. Why smoke? I can understand. Especially I hate people smoking in the street. Smoke on the road is one thing that is harmful to the people around you. Although all people do not quit smoking. Smokers need some kind of etiquette training.",A2
"I agree this statement. Because restaurant is place where people eat food. Smoker can smoke other place except restaurants. So, smoking in restaurant is should be banned. I don't smoke now sure. And, I won't smoke. Smoking is very bud for our body sure. But, it is good taste for us. So, we can't patient smoke. And, I claim that smoking should be banned in all public places. Sure, people who are smoking have power that they can smoke. But, people who are not smoking have also power that they can avoid bud smoke. Setting boundary line is difficult. All people wished that they want to be comfortable. Smoker must patient their dream that they can smoke everywhere for that. And, smoking is very bud for our body I said again. So, all people should stop smoking. If nothing smoke in the world, everyone is comfortable. But it is only dream. So, smoker should have manner in the least. I and people who are not smoking wish that public place contain restaurants is all banned smoking. It never is that we are all comfortable. But more people is careful, more people is comfortable. We should act for public. We should act for other people",B2
"WARNING: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health. I hate this statement that advertisers had been included in their advertisements. It is so foolish of them to sell these kinds of products and yet in the end of their advertisement, they affirm this piece of fact. Well, at least they gave a warning. But still, I am not in favor of this mere action. I agree with the decision that smoking should be banned in all of the restaurants in the Philippines. I am simply stating that I strongly agree. There are two main reasons why non-smokers hate it when they're with smokers: first of all, non-smokers hate that smell --- that smell which makes them expel air from our lungs by coughing; and second, they are aware with the fact that the ones who smell the smoke are more prone to having respiratory or lung diseases compared to the ones who are actually smoking cigarettes. I insist that it is really unfair to allow people to smoke inside the restaurants. There are a lot of disadvantages in this situation with regards to the health of the people. Add to that, it can be a distraction for people who are dealing with their own matters. I think that smokers can smoke in some other places and rather than in restaurants. Lastly, instead of smoking in the restaurant, they should be eating and spending time with their friends or family --- the reason why in the first place, they came in such place.",B1.2
"I am a non smoker. And I very, very, very hate a smell of the smoke. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also I love to cook. If someone smoke in my beside when I cooking, I will kick his face. I specially think that cooking is very holy. If smoke invades cooking Oh, no! That is vet terrible. Today smokers are very many. High school students, middle school students, girls and woman even my dog too? I feel to the many smokers. Clearly I do not hate them. Just I don't understand them and I curse a smoking. But finally I have to admit to them. Because many various people exist in the world. But I tell that it is need to another smoking place for the both of smoker and non smoker. The restaurants are too. I imagine that smoking place out of restaurants. Then smoking is not damage for cooking. I can't oppose the smoking completely. Because I don't understand every people in the society. Someone also does not understand me. Society will to try to understand with each other. For happy life of everybody. I think that is the heaven in the earth.",A2
"Many people believe that both having a meal and cigarette is the way of social life and doing business. However, while it is well known that smoking is bad for human's health, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, under the second-hand smoke environment is worse than smoking by them. Restaurant is a place for family, any kind of people even kids and pregnant women to have a nice meal. If you allow people smoke during the meal, it's not only very rude to other guest having meal with you but also hurtful to other customers sitting in the same restaurant. Second, all those customers who don't smoke might stop coming to the restaurants which reduce the income of the restaurants and make them shot down easier. The taste of food would be destroyed by having smoke at the same moment as well. It is not a really proper way for enjoying a nice lunch/ dinner. Last but not least, smoking is not a requirement during the meal. Normally people want to smoke after the meal instead of during the eating process. If people want to have a more relaxing conversation by having a cigarette, they can also go outside or some other places such as lounge bar. Smoking in a restaurant is not only an impolite behavior but also cause other customer's bad influence on their health. To sum up, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.",B2
"Yes, I totally agree with that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, restaurants are public areas. Indeed, each one of us has freedom to choose what we can do. But we have no choice to refuse when we smell the second-hand smoke. Since we're in the society, we have the responsibilities to respect others. In a public area, there must be some people who are not interested in smoke, not to mention there's no other way to hide from the open area. Second, restaurants are the place where we dining, which means we would take a long time to chat and eat. When there's someone smoke, the atmosphere and mood of the meal must be affected, and what's worse, a meal often takes an hour or even longer. It is definitely a disaster to be polluted in such a long time. The last but not the least, the ban of no smoking in public areas is already announced. Officially, smoking in public is no doubt an illegal act. It is also a right for us to protect ourselves from second-hand smoke. To my conclusion, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, no matter emotionally or officially, to reach the balance between personal free will and the mass advantages.",B2
"Part time job are some work that we pick for finding some money or used for experience. I think it is called Part time job because the job is not our main job; it is only for extra time we have, and we got some money for it. I think there are two meanings of part time job, first is the job that you pick because you don't have money for looking a real job, it can be your time are used for your school or college, maybe you have some practice to do, in my country, some college have the night class that called Kelas malam, that night class is used for students that don't have time for studying in regular class, maybe the students have some work to do, and that work I called part time job. The second meaning is job that you picked second, and of course the job are not your main job. Let me tell you example, if someone have started a job, it can be he work as a employee in office, and he realize that the salary that he got is not enough for his family life, he will find some money again, and he find a job that called a part time job that I mean.",A2
"I agree with this statement, and I actually do a part-time job after my classes. I think it necessary to do a part-time job. First, we learn many things in working. I think that the part-time job is a chance of learning to fit into society. College students will become a member of society in the near future, so it is very important for us to learn the society. The most important thing I have learned is that many kinds of people live in the world and I have to broaden my outlook. Besides, college student is a grown-up, though he studies in university. So we have to take care of ourselves little by little. When I began to do a part-time job, I know for the first time the difficulty of earning my living. And I realized how much I owe my parents. Moreover, college students need money to enjoy their campus life. We have a lot of time to spare in our school days. So we often want to enjoy traveling with our friends. We also want to enjoy our hobby. In either case, we need a lot of money. So we have to keep on working to earn more. Therefore, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.",B1.2
"The cigarettes is not permitted to enter the restaurant, i agree with this opinion, because almost everyone know that cigarette smoking, is not good for our healthy. A restaurant is a public facility, where there are so many people who not at all of them are smoker. Many people go to the restaurant for their meals. Smoking is one of bad habit in our country, they called it as culture. After having lunch or dinner, they have to smoke one, two or more the cigarettes. In fact, they have to spend much money on cigarettes every day. We know there are so many effect if we are smokers, bad effect surely. First, the most effect is disturbing the breathing, disturbing the lung, and the most scream is cancer of lung, and so on. So this is one of reason, why the smoking is not allowed in restaurant. But i think, this is not only for restaurant as public facility, but also in other public places Some of the solutions is the owner of restaurant provide a special place for smoker, where at that place only for they who have a smoke. But at sometime, this rule is not followed by some people, they feel lazy to go to the box smoke. So, next time, the government has to give a rule about smoke and hard punishment for everyone who disobey the rule.",B1.1
"I agree with that statement. First, smoking has bad effect on our bodies. Once we smoke, it makes hard dependence. And they say smoking causes many cancers or any other sickness. It is said that smoking is dangerous for not only smoker but also no smoker. Some people say smoking is more dangerous for no smoker being near smoker rather than smoker. Second, restaurant is place we eat dinner or so. We enjoy it not only taste but also its smells or looks. When we feel smokes and dinner at the same time, interest to our dinner may be lost rapidly. Smoking makes bad feeling for not smokers but no smoker around them. It is a common thing, smoker smoke carefully, but smokes go to no smoker and make bad feeling. Third, if we make smoking space in Japanese restaurant, we must install machines that let smoke and dirty air go outside of the restaurant. That costs more expensive than making no smoking space. In Japan, it is extending to decrease smoking people. It is not necessary to built expensive restaurant against Japanese present tendency. According to these reasons, I agree with that statement.",B1.1
"The trend of part time job is very common in Pakistan as well as in other countries. Specially in European countries because parents cant support their child for their basic needs. It is very common specially in students. The students which are not rich or parents can't spend their money on their studies or parents cant afford them. Part time job mean to do job during studies there were many reasons for part time job. Students do a lot of work to support them self's. In morning they join schools, colleges or universities or at evening they do jobs. Some students do part time jobs just because of fun or some on the basis of their interest but really need it. I think its not necessary for college students and the students who do part time jobs because of their family problems. Parents insist their child to support the family. because their income was not enough to support whole family. And they also studied same time because of burden they lose their health or not able to do one thing properly. But some Child were very talented. They do job or also give proper time to their studies. Their academic record was good. I think if student don't need job then don't do it just focus on their studies with full concentration.",B1.2
"It is important for college students to have part- time job because it allows college students to gain working experience prior to entering the real working society upon graduation. Depending on the nature of part-time jobs, administrative jobs can expose students to certain commercial software including the SAP, and also to hone his proficiency in other software like the Microsoft excel which useful in data crunching. Jobs in the customer-service industries can provide a very good platform to improve on individual's soft skills, including communication, inter-personnel relations, crisis- handling, and also boosting individual's confidence in facing the public. Besides gaining experience and improving skills, it allows student to spend time wisely instead of lazing around at home during the holidays. It provides additional income for college students who may need to spend more due to the increased activities at that stage of life. On the national level as a whole, part-time workers constitute to an important segment of the overall workforce. There are many situations where manpower is needed to cope with emergencies for example sudden surge of diners during Chinese New Year, or surge of tourists during the holidays. Other examples include temporal shortage of manpower due to resignation of staff and maternity leave. As such, college students can be capitalised to fill these manpower gaps to maintain the overall productivity of various industries. However, it is important not to neglect studies as a result of working. Proper time management is required as a pre-requisite to part-time working during school term. It is therefore encouraged to work during school holidays which can be as long as 3 months during the summer break. ",B1.2

Sometimes it may even feel overwhelming for us to keep up with our busy schedule. However I believe it is critical for us as college students to have a part time job since it helps us to be more responsible in our actions. It not only helps us to be more conscientious in our spending but also allows us to be more alert to use our time more efficiently. If we earn our own money, we will be more careful in our spending too. It is true that harder we earn our money it is less likely that we waste or spend it easily on unnecessary items. Moreover, it is our responsibility to be more dependent as we get older. If we don't earn our money and just get it from our parents, it will get harder and harder for us to be independent.

University is a place for students to learn knowledge, it just similar to secondary school, it is one of the ways that we can get a better job in the future. Student paid a lot of effort so as to getting into university to study the subject which they are interested in, and study is the responsibility of the student, having part-time job may takes their time on study and may not concentrate on their study. This may leads to a bad result in the examination or even cannot graduate if their result is very bad. In some case, student may need financial support because their parent cannot afford the expense in university, but there are many ways to get financial support such as the TSFS of the government or the University Financial Assistant, student who need financial support can apply these program to get the financial support, it is not a must to have part-time job for their daily expense.",B1.1

" The question whether college student have a part-time job becomes a hot topic nowadays. Everybody has different opinions. Let's think about what we can get from having a part-time job. Of course we can acquire a lot of experiences and get some extra money to improve our life in college. On the contrary, what do we lose when we have a part-time job? We will lose many time and energy. And it may be influence our study. So I don't think there is a certain answer to the question mentioned above because each student has different situation. To some students whose family lack richness, they may have to have a part-time job to afford their tuition and even help their family to improve life level. It is important to these students who want to have a job after college to have a part-time job in college for they need abundant experience. There are some other students who want to continue studying domestic or go abroad after school. Maybe it is not that much important to them to have a part-time job. For these students, what they should do first is studying well. In a word, college life should be rich and colorful; studying is not the only goal that every student has. We should read more valuable books and learn more skills. If we have more spare time, we can think about having a part-time job. Whatever, we should not waste our precious college life.",B1.1
"Smoking and breathing the smoke are bad for our health. When someone smokes, people around him breathe the smoke. If it occurred at the restaurant, the smoke would prevent them from enjoying meal because they don't feel the smell and the taste very well. Moreover, they may feel uncomfortable. In case of me, I hate tobacco and the smoke. When my parents smoke during my meal, I feel uncomfortable. I get them not to smoke while I eat meal. At the restaurant, I make it a rule to choice the no smoking area. However, when no smoking area is full, I sit the smoking area unwillingly. Then I can't enjoy meal. I go to the restaurant to enjoy meal. I want to eat at home rather than eating meal at the smoking area. The smoke not only prevent enjoying meal but also is bad for our health. Smoking people don't have a right to prevent enjoying meal and influence the other people's health. They should consider the environment and people around them. If they did so, they would realize that they should not smoke at the restaurant. If the restaurant banned smoking, people who are like me enjoy meal. So, smoking should be banned at the restaurant.",B1.1
"Part time job means earning at the free time. With the passage of the time the value of the study is increased and most of countries meet the price crisis. Most of the students do job at their free time to fulfill the needs of their expenditures whose parents cannot afford. Students, who are interested in learning and belong to poor family, do part time job to fulfill his need. Most of the countries are underdevelopment and Pakistan is such a country most of the population of Pakistan is poor they cannot afford the expenditure of the study of their children. But they have great fond that they taught their children. Anyhow, Part time job is benefit or not be. It is not benefit because it has a great effect on study. The attention of the students toward the job his attention is fully divided. He gives very short time to study. Due to it his progression in study is weaker day by day. . He remains busy whole day and does not give much time to his family. It is benefit in that respect due to the part time job students knows the importance of earning and they expend money accurately at right time. The experience of the students is enhanced by the job they well aware the social values. If a student do job by teaching the other students its knowledge and experience is increased and he is able to meet the requirement of his life. Through part time job he was able to serve country and nation and he become more patience. He spends his life as a person of well experienced. Thus, part time job is necessary for all the students.",B1.1
"I agree to the above argument. No smoking in restaurants and of course, common sense, you think that etiquette is to be guarded. Smoking makes people uncomfortable. The restaurant uses a lot of people. Therefore, should not smoke cigarettes. Unfortunately, people are vulnerable to the lure of tobacco smoking in restaurants are often smokers. The people do not feel well. In Korea, so many people smoke. As we know, smoking brings many harmful effects; especially teenagers and children affected these harmful effects easily than adults. Smoking is main cause of lung cancer. In addition, easy-to-hand smoke cigarettes cause cancer and smoking directly affects the poor more than anyone. A restaurant meal often come a lot of families. The children of the loop the smoke is harmful to health. Some smokers smoke in a restaurant to try to make sure that the most important. If there are smokers in a restaurant employee said this to prevent the smoke is also a good idea to ask. For smokers, even if their health should be non-smoking. Smoke-free restaurant should provide a good environment for guests. Nonsmoking is healthful and comfortable in a life. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is important",A2
"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think that there are three reasons. At first, I think that college students should do what they want to do during school days. For example, studying abroad, traveling some countries, traveling Japanese, etc. If they do these things, they must grow up more than now. But they actually can not do these things. Because they do not have much money, they can not do these things. So they need a lot of money and must save for what they want to do. Second reason is to learn real societies. A lot of college students will work in offices. Then, if they do not know real societies, they can adapt themselves to real societies easily. So they need to have a part-time job. Third reason is to meet people of various generations. But almost all the people are not same generation with college students in real societies, they must work in offices. If they can experience to meet people of various generations during school days, they can adapt themselves to real societies. In other word, to have a part-time job is to gather experiences in real societies.",A2
"The majority of countries by the past few years have extended the ban of smoking of tobacco in all forms in the majority of public places; this includes the category of enclosed and open locations such as the hospitals, shopping centers, schools and restaurants, this is to include bars, village coffeehouses. I am a believer that dining should provide an enjoyable experience to all individuals and once this is compromised or affected it no longer will provide a sense of well-being in dining. I is a fact that when smoking, the olfactory senses of the taste buds on the tip of the tongue is hampered in its ability to distinguish one flavour from the other, spoiling the palette not only for the diner but those unfortunate enough to sit within range of the tobacco smoke plume. It could lead to the possibility of the triggering off of asthmatic attack, or allergic reaction similar to hayfever, due to the differing sensitivity levels toward foreign particulate matter. It is shown that hemoglobin levels in Red Blood Cells could be effectively reduced leading to increased stress on the cardiovascular system and the possibility of pre-mature aging and occurrence of heart attack. The formation of atherosclerotic plaque leading to the blockage of capillaries could result in fatal stroke, susceptible especially in the elderly population. The production of free radicals would lead to damage of lung tissue and formation of tumour i. e. carcinogenic effect.",B1.2
"It seems that every college student wants a part-time job nowadays, which I think is not necessary. No one can deny the fact that doing a part-time job makes you nearer to the real world. Without having their parents to depend on for advice and guidence, fresh men need to improve their abilities of living and deciding things by themselves. At the same time, gaining some work experiences and sharpening their skills before graduating can be help in this competitive society. Also, popular as the conceptâ€”â€”part-time job is, more and more students believe that the traditional kind of college lifeâ€”â€” sitting in classrooms studying all day is just out of date. They tend to go out, seeking a chance to get an cool job. After all, making money on their own sounds extremely exerciting. However, at the negtive concern, problem arises that different from some developed countries, (where students commonly take part-time jobs and from where the word part-time job came)the money part-time jobs can provide in China is so little that almost no one can actually live on it and keep setting aside an appropriate amount of time for learning as well. So money is not the key of its popularity. For many of us, a part-time job may only add 10% to our pocket money. Another hidden problem may be serious. As part-time jobs apell millions of college students, some people manage to use their passion and make traps to get them in. They often pretend to offer you an good job, talk you in and persuade you pay all kinds of procedure charge. My roommate was beguiled of 1000 yuan last term without hesitation! The part-time job market is far from safe for we college students. From where I stand, part-time job can provide some help for poor students and improve abilities in some degree, but is never necessary for everybody.",B1.2
"In today's society, a lot of countries have passed laws that ban smoking in public places, especially restaurants, because second hand smoking has been proven to be unsafe. Second hand smoke contains a lot of toxic chemicals, which are known to cause cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. Not only does it participate in one's body problems, it also contributes to the world's environmental problems. Some may argue that if smoking is banned permanently in restaurants, people will take it as another personal interference by the government. This is not essentially correct. Smoking in restaurants damages the public's health against their will and this could cause them a variety of lung diseases. People go to restaurants thing to have a social gathering, relax, or to simply have a quality time with their loved ones. Doing it in an unhealthy and unpleasant environment isn't necessarily enjoyable. Smokers also need to think about those people around them who are exposed to smoke, pregnant women, children, elderly, and the asthmatic. Smoking around them, in my honest opinion, is a selfish to do. If smokers want to take these risks, that is fine, but they should have to limit their smoking to the comfort of their own car or home and not in public places where the public is unwillingly exposed to second-hand smoke and its harmful effects. If people want to smoke despite the fact that it's dangerous to their health, it's completely fine so long as they limit their habit where no one who is unwillingly exposed to second hand smoke gets distressed. I believe that a smoker's bad choice shouldn't affect other people; hence, why it should be banned in restaurants. Smokers already have the liberty to smoke at their own will and privacy, so I suppose banning it in restaurants is beyond reasonable.",B1.2
"Many countries have restrictions on the quantity of cigarettes or tobacco that can be brought into the country. In many countries, tobacco products are taxed heavily, so travelers importing more than a few packets of these products should expect to pay import duties. On the other hand, many countries also have facilities that permit departing travelers to purchase these same products, duty free, at the border, as they leave the country. People who smoke products other than tobacco should be aware that cannabis and other recreational substances are prohibited in many countries. Some countries impose severe penalties for attempting to import even a small quantity. If you are found in possession - and some cases even carrying implements that can be, or have been, used for smoking these products - you may be arrested and imprisoned, possibly for life. In Asia, particularly in China, smoking is still something of a social activity, at least for men. Anyone with cigarettes will offer them around before he lights up; having an expensive brand is a status symbol. Female smokers may be thought odd; more men and fewer women smoke in Asia than in Western countries. Restaurants do not usually have non-smoking areas; many do not have ashtrays either. Areas such as bus stations may have ""no smoking"" signs, but these are often ignored. Non-smokers should be prepared to endure smoky rooms. Even in China, though, this is slowly changing. Smoking is now forbidden in many restaurants, at least in major cities.",B1.1
"When we become university students, the responsability to our family is higher and higher, because we grow older, we don't want our parents to work too hard and we will want to reduce the burden of our parents. Furthermore, the social network become larger and larger when we enter the university, so the gathering with the friends would be more frequently. So when the outcome increase when we enter the college, we would need a part time job to earn money and acheive the balance. Work experience is very important to our future career, the employer will like the interviewers have work experience so that they can handle the new job easily. Also, from the part time job, we can learn how to cooperate with the others in the same company and face the boss. The part time job with let us become more mature, and easy to adapt the society when we have graduated. So, the part time job is really important for our university students, through the work, we can earn some extra money for our daily life and reduce the financial pressure of the family. Furthermore, we can earn work experience through the job, and it'll benefit for us when we interview the jobs after graduated. That's why many university students would like to have a part time job.",B1.2
"As for banning smoking in restaurants, I absolutely believe smoking should be banned. Furthermore, why stop with restaurants? Before I address this question I will give my reasons why I believe smoking should be banned in ALL restaurants. To begin, let's start with the obvious. It has been scientifically proven that second hand smoke has enough toxins to cause lung cancer and many other diseases such as heart disease. In the very worst situations second hand smoke causes death. At the very least, simple discomfort is caused by second hand smoke. From the worst to the least there are countless reasons smoking in restaurants should be banned. Not only should it be banned, in my solicited opinion, it should be illegal. I feel there should be consequences for people who smoke and create a dangerous environment simply because they feel they have the freedom to do as they wish with their lives. I believe these incredibly selfish people lack respect for others. They feel that by not smoking is asking too much of them, as they are basically drug addicts. Everyone knows that drug addicts do not consider others when they need their drug of choice. These selfish people also have polluted ideas of what personal freedoms really are. I do believe smokers have the right to smoke and should be permitted to smoke regardless of the medical consequences. However, I do not believe that society should not be held responsible for the medical costs caused by smoking. Now, to address my earlier question, I believe smoking should be banned in all public areas. And I mean all public areas. Smoking should only be permitted in one's home. That's it! They should not be permitted to smoke outside their own home. Not even in their yard.",C2
"Smoking in public area has been a huge issue in our society for a long time, and because of that, it is becoming illegal in many countries in the world. As it is well known, smoking is bad for smoker himself, but also very harmful people near him. Even though it has been banned from many public areas, we still see people smoking in restaurants, where people eat, rests, and have a conversation. It is not right to smoke in restaurants, and it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Like I mentioned, smoking is harmful to people near, not just to smoker himself. It is found that secondhand smoking is more harmful than smoking. Smokers do not have right to harm non smokers, who are not happy to be harmed. Restaurant is a public place for everyone, and if people start to smoke, non smokers in the restaurant inevitably breathe all the harmfulness in the cigarette. That is why it should be banned. Let's say that there is a happy pregnant woman in the restaurant, having a meal and a conversation. If one person starts to smoke in the restaurant, he is harming the woman and a baby inside of her, and disturbing the happiness the pregnant woman enjoying in the meal. Is this something that should be happening?",A2
"Smoking should be banded in restaurants/hotels or not? I am totally agreed with this point of view but here the question arises that how can a act of an individual person is harmful for others. Every person is independent and in the whole world there is no law of interfering in one's personal life. But one's independence ends where his right starts. It's the responsibility of a person that his act will not harmful for others. everyone knows that smoking is less harmful for smoker or more harmful for the people sitting near him. In hotels or returners where people come for relaxation or enjoyment a smoker creates a bad impact. People dislikes him and teenagers attracts towards him, the craze of smoking develops in their minds. Smoker disturbs People by smoke while they are eating food or anything else. It also causes serious diseases. So what should we have to do in this situation? In this situation it is a responsibility of hotel management to make smoking rooms or band smoking in sitting or dinning hall. It's also the responsibility of government to assign security, police or special rangers to stop smoking in public places. It would be beneficial for our society.",A2
"As a part-time nurse, this question really strikes home, because I've been doing it for a long time. I've been working as a part-time nurse ever since I was in college, and it has already been a great experience. It is really satisfying to see how your work can help others, and it is really great to see the smile of a family when one of their loved ones becomes well. Similar to this, I'm sure that there are many perks to other part-time jobs, and different students will find different pleasures from different endeavors. For me, I was lucky enough to find a good husband who brings in most of that income in our household, so I don't really have to worry about having a fulltime job. If I had not met him, I would probably have been much more motivated to finish my degree and find a full time gig so that I could support myself. This goes to show then there are a variety of individuals in the world, and each individual's situation is so unique that it is difficult to make a broad or all expansive judgment that will hold true for everyone. This is another way to say that the student should decide for himself or for herself if a part-time job is a good way to spend their time.",C2
"I think, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. First, I feel Smoking is dangerous. Because all years will have many patients died from diseases caused by smoking such as, air bag aneurysms, lung cancer, etc. Smoking is impolite that many people will look smoker so bad person. Now, governments want to smoker down so they make advertising and activities campaigning for people not smoking. In addition, we usually see tag on the wall in public place Don't smoking can be seen that many people don't like smoker. In fact, the government should issue laws controlling smoking in restaurants and public places. In concluding, smoking doesn't have benefits and give harmful for smoker and people around you, too. The policy of the country about smoking in public places is announced in many years and the results is better and better. Many places respects it and don't allow customers to smoke. If police see any restaurants allow customers to smoke, the shop will be punished and the customers will be punished too so that is why the number is not high like in the past. But there are still many restaurants too that they don't follow the policy. What we can do is trying to watch out, keep our eyes on them and try to do our best to stop people to smoke in the restaurants.",B1.1
"I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because restaurants are places where we enjoy something special foods and conversation with friends, family, or a boyfriend or girlfriend. Smoking doesn't need there. Smoking in restaurants has two bad things. One is that smell of smoking is bad for foods. For example, we can't enjoy the smell of foods if there are people who are smoking in the restaurant. Smell is an important part of food. We enjoy foods by not only taste but also smell. Smell can make foods good, or otherwise it can make foods bad. And the other is that smoke is bad for health. In restaurants, there are a lot of people, babies, children, teens, adults, and olds. Smoking has bad influence in them all. Smoking is bad for health of all people, especially bad for health of babies and pregnancy women. Smoking people don't have the right to make their health bad. Smoking has these two bad things. That's why I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should consider foods of that restaurant and health of people around them.",B1.1
"I think having a part-time job is important for college students, because in a part-time job we can learn many different experiences Some students just learn about his major, but others skills are very poor, for example, some students just know how to get along with books but don't know how to get along with person. In a part-time job, we can learn how to get along with boss, even can learn how to cooperate to get the work. And we also can absorb some different knowledge from jobs. For example, some job about sells, we have to know that the goods detail before our works, so we can learn some new knowledge. In the job, we can meet many different person, we can learn something special from each person. Last month I had a part-job, and I met one girl she teach me how to baking bread and cake, I think this knowledge is more important than money for me. Now, some students don't need money but get part-time job, because they want to learn something new that is school lack.

"Nowadays, many college students in foreign countries choose to take a part time job. However, most Chinese college students are still prone to pay little attention to doing part jobs and focus only on their major study. In my opinion, the pros of doing part time jobs overweigh its cons. I have mainly four reasons for it. In the first place, doing part jobs is a symbol of being independent which means you are no more a child and you can take good care of yourself. Second, you can learn quite a lot from the job. It will help you broaden your horizons, gain more experiences and get more close to the society. As a saying goes that experience is the best teacher, the meaningful experiences will make you adjust to the society much better and will benefit you the whole life. Third, as we all know time is limited and valuable in college and doing a part time job is often in conflict with studying. Hence, taking a part job will force you to know how to balance your work and study and how to use time to the fullest. Last but not least, if you take a part time job, you will get a sum of money which can be used to cover tuition and purchase whatever you want. What's more it will also teach your how to handle and manage your money. In conclusion, although learning is our main task and doing part job will take much time, it benefits us quite a lot. From my point of view, universities and college students should make join efforts to advocate college students to take a part time job.",B1.1
"There are many people who love smoking. And we can find a lot of people who smoke in public place. Even in restaurant. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because the people who are not smoking will dislike it. Also, when smoking during eating, we cannot feel the flavor and scent of food. Smoking in restaurant is really rude for other people who are not smoking. Smoke can be disgusting to people who do not smoke, so people are unpleasant. In addition, indirect smoking is worse than direct smoking to health, and it is difficult to breathe for some people who are asthma. Also, cigarette smoke can be unpleasant to even smokers when they have a meal. Cigarette smoke is strong, so it makes people not to feel the flavor and scent of food. People go to restaurant to eat a great food, and flavor and scent are important to have a good meal. However, cigarette smoke disrupts to have a meal. In addition, cigarette smoke is not easy for changing the air. When a person smokes in a restaurant, cigarette smoke does not get out of there well. People have a right to have a meal in delightful restaurant. Smoking is a choice. People who want to smoke can smoke, but they should not do damage to other people who do not smoke.

God has sent us in this world with a great purpose. And our holy prophet (PBUH) was a also sent with this purpose which was teaching and learning. In the beginning is it was very easy to get knowledge but with the passage of time it has become very difficult to acquire it. Because of the expenses of the study. People are facing lot of problem because of their earning and it is very difficult for them to manage daily bread. But as we know this is age of science and technology. Everybody wants to get more and more education. But due to insufficient income of their parents and some other worse circumstances they have to do part time jobs to meet their expenses. That's why these many students are doing part time job during their studies. It is very difficult for them to manage two very tiresome task. They are compelled to do part time jobs but it is necessary for them. The adverse circumstances taught them lot of things about like during their studies. They become very mature at very early age. But it is very sad because they can't pay full attention towards their studies. Sometime some students do very hard jobs which made them very much fatigue. And after doing some hard job they can't do their studies properly. It is very sad because our government is not doing something in this regard. As the days are passing the expenditure of studies is going increase. The Govt. should give some cession to the students in studies or at last provide some suitable jobs which are not very hand or difficult. And it should not be like that who prove students just to get money. And they deliberately don't pay full attention to their studies or left it incomplete.,B2
"I agree the opinion, because almost students will get a job after graduating college. When they enter a company, they experience many things that they won't have done. There is big difference between company and college. That time, if they experience part time job, they will get accustom to the company earlier than not experience. Through having a part time job, students can get much know-how in the case of business which the students can't study at their college. And we can get the chances that we make friends with people who don't have common points in their daily life. For many students who don't have a job, their social is college. They can make friends only through class or circle. But through part time job, we can make friends except college students and professor easily. Of course, the most important thing for college students is studying. It is nonsense to being crazy for the part time job too much and lazing studying. It is necessary to get balance between studying and working. But college time is important for young people. It is mottainai that students spend their time only to studying! I think young people should experience many things positively. Getting a part time job is one of the choices students can choose. Of course students can select another choice, for example circle-activity, volunteer, getting license etc Those are important and meaningful, but we can't get money through those things. A part time job is a valuable choice killing three birds with one stone for us that we can get money, experiment, and friends.",B1.1
"I agree with this opinion It is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think it is important to gain social experience by a part-time job. Because, many college students have lived in the limited relation of people that is called school. They don't know the large relations of people in the society. In it, there are many kinds of people. For example, people who help them or interfere them. In the school, if they think they don't like some people, they can avoid that one. But in the society, there are some cases that they can't avoid someone who they don't like. They can know it by a part-time job. I also think they can know the importance of money by having a part-time job. They have been given money from their parents. They don't know how hard earning money is. So they sometimes waste money. If they have a part-time job, they can know it is hard to earn money by working. If they know this, they decrease the frequency of wasting money and they can know the troubles of their parents on working. They respect their parents. I agree with this statement according to that two reason.",A2
"Actually, smoking is not good for health. Because smoke result sickness of lungs disease, heart disease, cancer, chronic illness and etc. but there are many people not yet understand about dangerous of smoke. They are not interest with health. For them, smoke become hobby of them. Many people have a smoking very difficult for stop from smoke for them if not smoking. They will feel not nice and they cannot get a good inspiration. In spite of passive smoke also more serious, because can make happen suffer sickness infertile for girls, lungs disease, heart disease, and etc. This condition, caused by passive smoker more many to suck in smoke from other people while active smoker a few to suck in smoke because they are only enjoy smoking. According my idea, I agree about smoking should be completely at all the restaurant in the country because with that procedure to avoid air pollution and many sickness which caused by smoke. In beside that, this procedure also can make many people to be economical of money them. Because they are not again buy a cigarette and they are also not improvident. That for, we must be to avoid many smokers in our country, maybe if we direct stop smoker for not smoking that cannot because if someone being addicted of smoke so that is very difficult to stop.

Choosing to work part-time job during the study is a tough decision for collegian will inevitable have to make. Many collegians can work part-time jobs and study simultaneously. In order to make the right choice. The collegian's situation must be taken into account. Should be looking for his financial situation, as well as his schedule. Also, the type of work involved must also be considered. But, the question is it can adjust college student's life.

Working a part-time job make collegian to start learning about the working world. They can learn how to write resumes and how job interviews work. Interacting with fellow employees will tech how collegians should deal with people. Finally, with a study income, parents can stop giving allowance and let their kids earn their own money.

"According to a recent study, second hand smoking does more harm to nonsmokers than to smokers. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country.

Second hand smoking causes air pollution and makes nonsmokers feel uncomfortable. The government should pay attention to this issue. Smoking is not only harm the smokers but also does more harm to nonsmokers. While the smoker's bodies have adapted the adverse effects of smoking, non smokers don't have this advantage. Restaurants are public places that everyone can come in and go out. Second hand smoking should be banned in the restaurant, and smokers need to obey the regulations and respect nonsmokers who don't want to breathe second hand smoking. The most important thing is that our government should make laws of smoking in the restaurants. Those people who smoke in the public places such as department store, school, and restaurants should be fined. And it can also establish a team to catch smokers who smoke in the public.

"I think it is important for university students to have the experiences of working in part-time. Working before graduated from school can provide a wide perspective of life and a right thought about using money and the value of money. Also, it can train our minds, patience and bodies. Make us be strong and thankful for all we have already had. We can know what kind of environment and treat we will face when we work for a full-time job from working for a part-time job. Besides, we can learn social skills and grow the ability of coping with difficulties. We would understand that this big society is more variable and complex than we thought and been told. The money we earned by ourselves will be used more carefully than those getting from parents absolutely. Having different part-time jobs can let us understand that which job is really fit us and we want to work. Though part-time jobs are generally hard, challenge and exhausting to us, may also have some unfair treat, we should try for an experience, a chance to change us to a mature adult. See the short of ourselves clearly and learn the good personalities from others. Go and get the part-time job now!",B1.2
"I agree with the statement that to have a part-time job is important for college students. I have three reasons as following. First, they can study to be a member of society through a part-time job.

To take a step to be a member of society, a part-time job is necessary. Second, they can know an importance of money. Most of the college students have been supported by their parents or other people. So, they must have not had a chance to know an importance of money or how difficult earning money is. I don't think all of them have been in such a situation. But, knowing such things is important for all students. All people can't glow up by their own power. Parents or a person who raise children earn money to raise children desperately without using it for themselves. It is very hard. Knowing their pain, we should appreciate what they have done for us. Third, working is hard, but, working is very enjoyable. For example, when we work, we contact with others and they give us thanks or we give a harvest and others praise us. Thus, we can feel challenge, grow up, and get satisfaction. With this, I agree with that statement. Having a part-time job make our life fruitful!!",B1.1
"As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China. Smoking produces bad smell. If smoking is allowed in the restaurants, guests would feel disgusting and the wall in the room is easy to become yellowish, which is bound to have a bad effect on the business because almost all the customers esp. the would prefer the non-smoking places to have a meal instead of where smoking smell are filled. Some may hold the view that the banning may be makes some people reluctant to enter the restaurants, but I don't think it is true. Customers would not refuse to keep themselves from smoking just for so short time, no one must smoke during their mealtime. Moreover, statistics show that majority of the customers say that they would come to have a meal as usual. And take the airports and the cinema for example, where smoking has been banned for more than 10 years, the number of the passengers wasn't declined due to the policy at all. On the contrary, some restaurants become more popular with customers after the banning has started. Ireland has already put this policy into use since 2004 throughout the whole country, followed by so many European countries, and British even use the strict punishment to make smoking banned, all which tells us that smoking are sincerely regarded to be unhealthy and the banning throughout the country is becoming a unavoidable trend. So why don't China follow the trend which could absolutely benefit us in the long run? Some countries even rule that smoking is only allowed in people's home. All in all, I suppose smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China.",B1.1
"For part-time job when I'm older children should think to do that once in a while. Because part-time job to learn a variety of social and would love to learn to socialize and hang out because I think. Grasp the concept while working part-time job without receiving money from parents to themselves, things have something to write and think proudly of money. One point is also useful as a part-time job. Experience while working part-time in the community through various moves us a little bit easier, and by When it later and could be good for him, the background. In addition, while working to meet many friends and relationships so as to widen the relationship you could take a little bit about. Experience and make friends and also be economically independent from their parents is good for a part-time job, I think. Of course, as a part-time job could done bad things donation. Throw alcohol buy cigarettes, but all part-time students who are throwing everything they want to work part-time for little things, and reduce the burden on parents to let things because that there should be no need to worry about so far are: I tried several times to work part-time, but tired and wants to quit difficult situation at that time was many times. However, adding two days a month salary, yet I know how much I mean to buy a and I live there so excited and think that we do not receive a burden to my parents and became very hard to do things. Therefore important to work part-time students often need to experience for you and feel that sometimes.",B1.2
A part time job is not a job. Usually young people do the job. In Korea made a rule which is the basic salary for the people. It's 4320won. In addition the employer also gives the basic salary. The employees make smaller money than that work time and the work is very hard. However there are so many jobs and there are many employees. Young people or a person doesn't have professional qualification or idea cannot regular job. Because regular jobs need a professional idea for their company. Why student need a part time job? They need money to buy something. The university tuition is very expensive. They don't want their parents have to take heavy responsibility so they want to make their pocket money. In the other hand Another student needs their tuition. They have made their own fees. When I was a high school student I just wear a uniform or school t-shirt and eat food which given by school. However university student is different. We need more everything. We need clothes which are not uniform and we have to eat different place which we have pay. In conclusion a part time job is personal choice. The people who need money can get a job.,B1.1
"Of all countries to ban smoking in restaurants is the sound silly. Why this topic has been presented as a problem you cannot understand the intentions of the questionnaire. Is it possible to smoke in public places, as I'll understand? To ban smoking in public places where non-smokers in a smoker's perspective, not to think at all, are not considered. Smokers who underwent a questionnaire is very disliked the appearance. Mentally and physically harmful would smoke in the forefront of the country to choose a path that is not a specific system has a fail to exclude smokers staying at the time is wrong. He is not paying for smokers harm not only a place for smokers. Blindly without regard to smokers to quit smoking in public places is wrong, think of the place to begin. This is shown in a previous essay followed by implementation of national institutions will need to talk. Space for smokers ready to let re-thinking a problem Also got a smoker as a person, you should not think one way to non-smoker both should be understandable and flexible thinking.

"In my opinion smoking should definitely be banned in public places as it not has effects on the many non smokers. Besides, many youngsters are fascinated by the act of smoking which may later develop into a habit. Everyone knows cigarette is bad. We feel terrible when member in family is smoker. Cigarette destroys smoker and his family. Men smoke cigarette more than women. However, women tend to smoker cigarette increase. Every country fight people to discontinue smoking cigarette because it makes to be ill. So it is true that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It's smell destroy smoker and people in general. Pollutant of cigarette adheres food and drink. In addition, pollutant of cigarette adheres clothes. Pollutant of cigarette is dangerous. When infant get pollutant of cigarette, it destroys nerve. Smoking cigarette make nicotinism. Nicotinism causes that nicotin is in body too many. The smokers should stop smoking cigarettes for their family or themselves. our laws should not say that the purchase of cigarettes is legal, but actually smoking them in any public place is not. I do believe that a smoker should do so responsibly and with respect to those who do not smoke.",B1.2
"If you go to the convenience store or fast food restaurant, you can easily find university students working as a part-time job. I also have a lot of part-time experiences. Some think that college students should study hard on their major solely so that having part-time job is a waste. However, I believe that having part-time job is beneficial for college students by teaching two lessons to students: sociability and the importance of earning money. Firstly, working experience will give lessons how to interact with other people. You cannot develop the sociability through studying in front of the desk. For example, while I was working in the food restaurant, I could learn the difficulties and importance of encountering people. You would never know how to deal with lots of people and giving out great services according to the customer is really hard when you only stay in front of the desk. Secondly, you would realize the importance of earning money. You may find out that earning money is difficult. In my case, I mopped, cleaned the dishes, cashed money, and delivered the food for five hours a day and I paid only 5000 won (almost five dollars) per hour. It was really hard to earn money. It also gave me the motivations to study harder to get a good job, which can pay me a lot of money without this kind of physical effort. To sum up, I strongly think that having a part-time job as a college student is important because it is beneficial for students by giving two great lessons. They would learn how to deal with people in the pragmatic situations, and they can learn the importance of earning money by realizing the hardness of labor. Students, let's taste the hardness of labor to grow up!",B2
"It is well-known that smoking doesn't only cause to increase smoker's probability of getting sick but also their surrounding people. Now once sitting at table, we won't leave until finishing meal. In other words, with smokers at restaurants we breathe some smoke all the eating time and take not clean dishes covered with smoke. Smoking allowed at the restaurants forces us to eat dishes polluted with smoke; besides it's about over an hour until our ending to clean on the table in front of. There is a similar situation around us which is as follows: noises on the train, that is to say too high volume music dropped from the earphones. Naturally, on the train people have right to behave freely at some agree. However, do the listeners at too loud volume interfere with other's right as a passenger? Of course, we say no. Equally, it mustn't be allowed that smokers at the restaurants interfere in our enjoying meals. Moreover, there are a plenty of families having at the restaurants. Smoke is especially harmful to children. For our children's good health, which in turn for society in the future, smoking at all the public places should be banned soon as possible.",B1.1
"Every one knows that smoking is bad for our healthy. A nonsmoker smokes indirectly if people surround him smoke in a small place as a restaurant. It is a short time in the passive smoking time for a person comes to the restaurant as a visitor, but the waiters of the restaurant must come to work in the smoke of the cigarette all day. The prohibition of smoking in the restaurant should be carried out to follow their health. Many people think that taste, an appearance and a smell are important for the best cooking. When I smell the cigarette, I have a headache. The smell of the cigarette is never comfortable for nonsmokers. Some people feel dishes bad if the smell of the cigarette drifts in a restaurant. It may decline to reputation of the restaurant. If it is a high-quality restaurant, most of customers do a dress-up and go to a meal. We cannot wash the expensive clothes in our houses, so we sent the clothes to the laundry. They must bring the smell of cigarettes and feel unpleasant even after leaving the restaurant. These problems are to be settled if a smoker endures smoking a cigarette for dozens of minutes. t is happy that the prohibition of smoking at the restaurant advances.",B1.1
"As a non-smoker, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. Smokers are of the minority, and in adopting a utilitarian position, a ban on smoking would benefit the largest group of people. The cost of smoking far outweighs the cost. For one, smokers produce second hand smoke which is harmful to the health of the general public. Without a ban, allowing smokers to smoke in restaurants would only serve to inconvenience non-smokers. In fact, the cost of this would be multiplied when considering the young, elderly, and those with existing health problems. Furthermore, many restaurants are increasingly becoming air conditioned, a setting totally unsuitable for smoke. Even with a designated smoking area, there is the risk that the smoke would enter the air ventilation system of the air conditioning unit. Moreover, the creation of a smoking area would also deny restaurant owners a potential profit making enterprise in the creation of an al fresco dining area. After all, it is not just the smokers who would prefer a non-air conditioned area. Social smokers however, would decry such a move, arguing that it inconveniences them, yet their argument begets the fact that they are inconveniencing others on their first place with their actions. Restaurants may also argue against such a ruling, as many businessmen do smoke, especially those choosing to entertain clients. However, I feel such acts are more likely to be taking place in night clubs or bars rather than in restaurants. As such, I believe that smoking should indeed be banned at all restaurants. ",B1.2
"College is considered by many as the training ground that prepares students for work. Most of the basic skills needed for any field of work may be acquired in college. This is attainable by engaging in different types of academic activity â€“ be it in the form of lecture or actual application. Both types of learning are vital to one's wholistic development, thus, having trainings in both aspects are usually included in the syllabi of universities. In line with this, the question of students having part-time jobs arises. Although it is highly recommended that students have an expertise on their field of work, I think that it is not necessary for one to be employed in a temporary basis. This is due to the fact that students have an obligation to study, and having a part-time job may interfere with their time to review. It wouldn't be a loss for students, as well, to not engage in temporary employment as most universities require OJT or On-the-Job Training for students who are about to graduate. The involvement of this program in a university's curriculum allows a student to learn and develop their skills in their line of work without having to compromise for study time. If the main concern of the given statement is the acquisition of skills needed for work, then it is not necessary for college students to have part-time jobs, provided that the university they are enrolled into has programs which allows them to simulate or participate in a work environment.",B1.2
"As for as the topic concern there are two major things to be noted job or students and here the factor society is also important. In general part time jobs is good for students they got confidence, knowledge, experience. They learn how to deal with people or how to contribute in society. As in foreign countries students should have few hours job and it is part of their studies. It makes them more practical but is all these things effect their studies or not? In foreign countries students are without burden. In our society study is very tough its burden more then knowledge. Majority of students belongs to middle class society they cannot afford their fee or other eXPENCES. they are responsible for their families and after completion of their studies they are unable to find good jobs, because in our society there is a demand of experience more than talent. When there is no appreciation of their talent, no jobs, no place, continuously failure its leads for suicide commitment, robbery, addiction or such immoral activities. Its responsibility of government to assign scholarship for students or provides them good jobs. Any how, I am strongly insist that student should do part time jobs not only for themselves but also for the betterment of society.",B1.1
"I never have a part time job before, because I never think it about it. I think part time job is the another way to support family. I think it's very useful to help everyone in your family. If I was in Mathayom 2 or 3 and having a part time job, it'll make me crazy about it. However, if my son or daughters want to have a part time job, I'll agree with them. Sometime, I saw my old friend studying and having a part time job as a stunt man, the day that I know about this, it makes me feel surprise. Not only me but all of my classmate is suffering about it and he make it secretly. So that if I can do a part time job right now, I'll do it.

"A pathway towards the corporate world In most scenarios, a four-corner classroom confines learning into theories. Subsequently, students have seemed to spend years to be living books of formulas, laws and rules, and speech marks. Several have over and done the outside world â€“ the corporate world â€“ where one is tasked to apply what is learned and not merely to fill in the blanks of test papers. Such scenarios reveal an advantage of students who have part time jobs especially during their college years. Yes, working student may entail risks in juggling studies and work but when one has get used to it, they will experience the best benefits part-time employment has to offer. First is the finance from salary that can aid education expense, for in most cases, it is the financial constraint that leads one to seek job. Also, not only that those students are exposed to the nature of their chosen field, but also they get the chance to put their learning into practice. This is an edge in the resume and in actual work, for the experience and preparation acquired. Third, due to tougher responsibilities, these student-workers gain a sense of responsibility, confidence and time management which are beneficial in workplace. Ironically, these skills are also the facilitators in maintaining high grades. Winding up, part time jobs may provide several risks and disadvantages but when maximized, it will surely worth the",B1.2
"As we know, smoking is bad for our health. But why do so many people smoke ? I don't smoke, of course. But someone who smoke a lot told me that he smoke because sometimes when he felt unhappy, he would smoke to release his feelings. I looked up some things about tobacco in the Internet, It started from America. But some researches show that in 650 D. C. People in Maya started to use tobacco. So it seems that smoking has a long, long history. And also as we know, a lot of great people are kind of addicted to smoking, such as Chairman Mao, Churchill and so on. Why are they so interested in smoking ?Of course they know it is bad for health. I think the main reason is that it can make them happy and feel less depressed when something bad happened. And it can make them think of problems better than without tobacco. So as I said, even though many people has proved that smoking is bad for our heath, I don't think it will disappear. As long as will have troubles, we will need tobacco. That's what I think.",B1.2
"No I do not agree with the statement. While there is no doubt that smoking is bad for one's health, banning it is not the way to go. This is because completely banning will open the floodgates to many other things to be banned. Other than smoking, many things are bad for health too, such as oily fried food and sugary soft drinks, should they be banned too? The answer is no. This is because whether something is ""good"" or ""bad"" can be subjective and relative. Oily fried food if eaten everyday will have very bad effects one's health, but if eaten in moderation, negative effects on health will be negligible and offset by the pleasure that it confers on the taste buds. From this example can be seen that every decision made has to be seen in a context. We are a mature and sophisticated society with citizens who can think for themselves. Banning will be too heavy-handed. Guidelines about no smoking in restaurants would be a better alternative. The restaurant owners should be allowed to make their own decisions as to whether smoking should be allowed on their premise. A great idea would be to follow Singapore's example and have ""yellow boxes' ---designated areas for smokers. In this way, both smokers and non-smokers will be appeased. Just make sure that smoke do not drift over to the non-smokers' area. ",B2
"If you mention the word Part Time all have to think about work during free time after school for students or students who are interested. Is that it does not do every day.

In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will make yourself more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Having to focus on your studies is not a valid excuse, because there are many options available for part-time work, ranging from a few hours per week at an on-campus job to 20-30 hours per week in the service industry off campus.

"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it provides them with the relevant working experience they would need when they start working in the future. College students would be able to gain working experience and skills which are things that school is unable to teach them. Also, with the lack of experience, students are more likely to engage to part-time job which start from lower levels. I feel that it is essential to start from the lower levels as this allows students to understand what are some of the problems faced as the lower levels when these students move up higher levels in the future. Part-time job allows students to interact with more people of different background and ages, the people that these students usually interact with are probably their family members and their friends. By taking up a part-time job, they get to interact with the supervisor, co-workers as well as customers who probably come from all works of life. Personally, after college, I took up several part time jobs and I interacted with people of different ages and backgrounds. What I learnt was that everyone has a story to share and it is always interesting to learn something new because these people are able to provide you with an additional opinion which you may need when making decisions in the future. Part-time jobs allow students to step out of their comfort zone because there is really much to learn out there. In this modern day and age, many students are definitely more privileged than students in the past and hence they may not be able to be as empathetic. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because there is much to learn. ",B1.2
"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The advantages of having a part-time job can be divided in two parts. The first part is before the job, and the second part is after the job. In the first part, which means college students try to find a good part-time job. They may read the newspaper or the internet to find what kind of job is good for them. During this process, they have to think carefully which job is better. In addition, they may try to introduce themselves to their boss and experience some interviews. They mush be confident to themselves so that they can make other people believe that they are ready to do jobs. In the second part, they have already worked for a period of time. Doing a part-time job must make them be more responsible to themselves. They also practice their social behavior when they are working. It must be an important experience for them before they are graduate and try to find a normal job in the future. They can higher their emotion quality. They also can use their time much better when they try to balance their life between their studies and jobs.

"In the restaurants have many people whether children or the elderly and there are some people for smoking. If you are the one who does not smoke and you do when you see people smoking in restaurant.

In order to protect children and some people not smoking because of the smoke of cigarette can harm health of people not smoking, at the restaurants is the public place, smoke can taste changes and is a bad example for children because in restaurant have many children. Therefore the country must to set the law about banned smoking at all the restaurants or open zone for smoker at all. In order to protect the people not smoking from smoke of cigarette. And the law should be strict and should punish people that smoke in public because will have some people smoking break the law if this law not strict.

"Recently, an issue of smoking prohibition in public area has been debated as a hot topic. In my opinion, smoking in public area especially when it is restaurant, should be prohibited because of the following two reasons. First of all, smoking is bad not only for smoker's health, but also for non-smoker's health. There are many research studies that have been conducted regarding to the relationship between smoking and health problem like lung cancer or larynx-linked disease. For example, nicotine or tar which is one of the most harmful ingredients included in tobacco, is well known to cause a serious cancer or disease to the non-smokers who inhale those things through secondary smoking as well as the smoker himself. Non-smokers have right to decide whether or not keep themselves from exposing towards the smokers. Secondly, smoking in all the restaurants should be banned because there also are many children among the people who visit the restaurants. It is pretty well known that children, unlike adults, are more likely to be affected by the secondary smoking. In case of family restaurants, problems are more serious than the normal restaurants. They should be not exposed to an unwanted smoking which can harm their health in a disastrous way. In conclusion, smoking in all public area, including restaurants should be prohibited for the other non-smokers. We should not disregard the non-smokers' rights to maintain their lives and surroundings as clean and fresh as possible. Banning all the smoking in all the restaurants should be executed immediately.",B2
"Part time jobs can help you financially especially when you're in college. College tuition fees vary on your course and of course, the school you are going to study at. If the university you are going to study at is well-known and has good standards, the more it is expensive. Though there are universities that offer scholarships, there are just chosen students who can commit to it. Some public schools offer less tuition fees but you still pay them. Having a part-time job can help you especially when you applied to a job that has great amount of salary but as a student, I doubt you're going to find a job that offers a lot of money. Studying while working can cause you difficulties on your time and schedule. It is either you're going to sacrifice time for your studies or your job. Working isn't really needed in college when you still have your parents to support you. It doesn't mean that you'll let them pay until you have children. You'll just have to pay them back by doing little things for them like washing the dishes and stuff, especially when your grades are high. Your parents will really appreciate it. They won't regret giving you the money to study in a prestigious university. So for me, part-time job isn't really needed unless you're family needs money and you have to sacrifice a little bit of time for working in place of studying. You must be determined to do both at the same time.",B1.2
"""Why college students should have part-time jobs?"" I think this topic is so faithless for me, because if the college students have their part-time jobs in their free time instead doing their homework or reading their books, their will waste their essential free time that their parents want them to do their best at learning. The things that the college students should really do are pay attention on their learning and their study responsibilities. My reasons that show why college students shouldn't have a part-time job are 3 reasons. First, they must to do their best on their studying so they mustn't waste their free time for doing the part-time job. They must use their essential free time for reading books or something else that will make them improve their learning ability. Second, their parents must to work hard for sending them the money for their learning at the university. It's not a few money, but it is a lot of money that they have to sacrifice their energy and their time for it!!! Third, the part-time jobs will make them tried, and will result in their studying. They will feel tried, don't want to learn and they may be slept in their class. So, these reasons make me believe that the part-time jobs are not suit to college students.",B1.2
"Smoking is very injurious to health. A man who smokes is very dangerous to his health. It causes diseases in lungs and cause cancer. Once a person addicted to smoking it's difficult to stop him from this bad disease. Smoking is a bad habit. If a person has a bad company of friends he also become a bad person and does bad habit like smoking. Some people smoke when they are in tension. People face the other people to smoke. Cigarette contain nicotine, tobacco, carbon monoxide, tea which destroy the lungs and respiratory system. College boys also smoke and no one stop this bad habit. It is very difficult to get out from this situation. Now a days people smoke very much. No one should stop. Government should out on this situation. Government should realize the people about bad habit of smoking. In Pakistan smoking is very popular and no one should recognize that it is dangerous for health. Islam provides the best to stop this situation. Medical research has make careful to the people about smoking is very dangerous to health. All people know health is wealth. Hazrat Muhmmad (PBUH) said that people to ignore all drugs this make man destroy. Smokers are free from all thing they are free from jobs and families are destroy.

" Whether college students should do part time job? really puzzles many socialists, college teachers and students as well. For me, I truly support the idea that college students should do some part time jobs. And here are some reasons below. Being a college student, we shouldn't spend all his time studying like a middle school student. Although study is a very important part in college life, gaining some social experience is also essential. We can join a lot of societies or students' organizations; do some volunteer work or some part time jobs. Doing a part time job not only makes you earn some pocket money and enrich social experience but also helps you to make progress all the time and form good habits such as time keeping, being responsible and saving money after your hardworking. Many college students will go to work after graduation. So it is absolutely an advantage if you have some working experience when you apply for a job than others. And nowadays social and working experience is required in many job applications. And I do think it important to find fun or curiosities when doing part time job otherwise you will frustrate and give up halfway easily. In the end, doing a part time job is good for us in most part. And I sincerely hope that each college student can lead a meaningful and colorful college life.",B1.1
"I agree this statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are three reasons. Firstly, it is because that some people don't like smoke. Also, people dislike a smell of cigarette. If a man smoked beside them in a restaurant, they would feel like their meal become more awful. Secondly, it is because that smoking is bad for our health. In fact, a lot of people get cancer of the lungs every year because of smoking. In addition, the cigarette smoke gives bad effect to people who are around a smoker. Surely, smokers have a right which they can smoke, but they should not give people who are around them troubles. Thirdly, it is because that increasing nonsmoking places in any public places would result that the number of people who smoke and suffer from a disease of the lungs decreases. It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking. As a matter of fact, my uncle tried to quit smoking in the past, but he still smokes now. However, if the number of place where people cannot smoke increased, smokers would be forced to give up smoking and the chance which people can smoke would decrease. For these three reasons, smoking had better be completely banned at all the restaurants.",B1.2
"Part time job is very important for college students. The statement was made based on my own reason. First, have a part time job will be useful for us one day in the future. We could learn how to earn our own money, how to manage our income, and many other things so the time we have will not be wasted. Moreover, if we are from another island, our part time job could reduce our family's financial problem even if it's just a little. Second, we must admit, sometimes, the money that is transferred monthly by our parents is not enough for our daily need. Earning money by ourselves will be a very helpful thing so we won't burden our parents by asking more money. They also can't complain about how we are going to use it because it's the money that we earn, so we have the right to manage it by ourselves. Last but not least, part time job helps us to be independent. It gives us experience to handle the problems we will face in our full time job in the future. It also helps us to learn how to socialize with our co-workers, how to be close with them, or how to handle the problems those occurred by them. It's also easier to find a job if we have the experience to work for the other people. For example, if we ever had a job and want to find a new job, our chance to be accepted is higher than the ones who never have a job at all. So I conclude that having a part time job is very important for college students.",B2
"Why the sign 'No Smoking' is placed everywhere? Because we all know that smoking is bad for our body and our environment. So smoking should be banned everywhere, no matter at restaurants or other places. There are some reasons below. On the one hand, smoking makes the air polluted. I think no one likes to breathe dirty air when they are at table. Besides, restaurant is a public place, where someone' behavior should not threat others' benefits, and smoking is such that makes damages to people. One the other hand, smoking just means to suicide slowly. Many reports have said that smoking is harmful to our lungs and increases the rate to get lung disease, not only the smoker but also others around them. In fact, the latter are more likely to get ill. So for the sake of our family and earth, everyone should stop smoking no matter where and when. As we all know, there is no benefits to smoke. Since restaurant is a loyal place to have meal, all of us should respect the public place. That is to say, we should try our best to fight with smoking, and smoking should be banned at all restaurants in country.",B1.1
"I think that a college student to have a part-time job is important. Because I can make money by myself. Besides, I can know many friends. Every holiday my friend and I can go singing at Cash-Box. After singing, we eat dinner together. Every day is a happy day. I love my friend, because people say ""True friends always help each other when they are in trouble"". A student to have a part-time job that can train his independent ability and thinking ability. There is no denying, a student to have a part-time job that is right. Now, many college students have a part-time job. They make money and work hard. Than, they fail their class. Because they work all night and tired, they sleep at their dormitory. When mid-exam is coming, they loss. This is so bad. We never give up our study. There are many kinds of work provide of students, such as convenience store or super market, video store, security company... etc. If you don't know how to choice part-time job, you can google at internet. You also can find 104 bank. You can choice the best of love.",A2
" The advertisements that advertised by students hunting for a part-time job are everywhere. A large number of college students say that they want to get a part-time job. But there are some people holding the point that it's not necessary for college students to have a part-time job. The supporters believe that a part-time job will benefit students for several aspects. First of all, students can get paid through their work which can reduce the financial burden of their family. In addition, having a part-time job can make students more independent which may be helpful for them to get ready for the coming challenges. Last but not the least, taking a part-time job will offer students some opportunities to acquire skills and experiences benefiting to their future works. The opponents criticize the supporters for their lack of long-term consideration. They hold the point that students must spare no efforts to study other than concern about other distractions. Only by study hard will they be well-trained so that they can start from a higher stage. As for me, taking a part-time job can only be a choice to students has lots of time. If students can't manage their study, they'd better not take a part-time job.",B1.1
"Part-time job Today, the college students that have a part time job are the normal thing because some students have some reason to get the money. But sometime the part-time job is not important for college students because some organ in Mae Fah Luang University have scholarship for many students that want some money to use to study in the university. Do not do the part-time job while you are college student also help you to have more time to study in class, review the lesson and learn more new things outside the class too. Someone think that part-time job is good to do on your free time and you also get the money but in the other hands getting part-time job maybe effect for your study. If you cannot plan for your time with job or study, you might be losing in two things in the same time. So I think that you should to choose to do only one thing because if you determine to do one thing in one time, the effect will be good for you. All universities want to help everyone that want to study so if you have the important season you should ask them to help you. If you brave, it is sure that you will get a good things for your future.",A2
"I agree the issue. The smoking is not politeness behavior in the restaurant. The taste can effect person enjoy the food and endanger their health. Eat food is a nice thing; it is make us relax, happy and satisfied. Sometimes, eat just for take a break to go to next works, if somebody smoking around you, and you are not a smoking, the feel is not good. The smoking is not a good hobby. Smoking is not good for health and the smoking have to deference to other people in the restaurant. Smoking person make me uncomfortable. Smoking is not good for our health; maybe it is make he feel good for minutes, but smoking to take a change for the health, and make people uncomfortable can not enjoy their food in the restaurant. The smoking can result in the lung cancer. If you smoking a lot and you obtain the lung cancer probability to be very high and not your family, friends but also people around you, either. The smoking can not enjoy the food in the restaurant. Smoking destructions sense of taste. If you smoking, people maybe don't like chat with you, because you are Smelly. In conclusion, the smoking is not politeness behavior in the restaurant. The taste can effect person enjoy the food and endanger their health. And maybe people have interpersonal relationship.",A2
"First of all smoking is very bad habit. But people adopt this habit in a wide range. All people knowing that smoking caused various horrible and dangerous diseases. Some of diseases are T. B, cancer, chest infection and cough. But now these days new generation also fall in bad habit of smoking very rapidly. Smoking occurs at every place, in hospital, in garden, in school and in college, university. But now even in the restaurant smoking is also finding. Smoking in restaurant is very bad habit. Because in restaurant the people who do not smoke affected by the smoking people. They suffer from many diseases. Nicotine that is used in cigarette which is the type of drug that affect the health and eatable things. If someone asked to smoker's reasons of smoking then they answer that they adopt smoking to release their tensions and worries. But they do not care about that other people too much upset and affected. In foreign country smoking become more common trend. But in high standard restaurant smoking is banned strictly in foreign country. Smoking is also polluted our environment. We should prevent our environment from the pollution of smoking. And should work to ban this thing.",B1.1
"I agree this statement. I have two reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, to ban smoking at all restaurants, people who do not smoke can be guarded from smoking air. Recently in Japan, more and more restaurants have separated a smoking section from non-smoking section, and at most restaurants, you can choose the section. However, there are still some problems. Firstly, there is still high possibility for non-smokers to breathe smoke, for example, non-smokers cannot choose a non-smoking section if the section is not vacant. In this case, they have to take seats in a smoking section, and they automatically breathe smoke. Also, just separating the sections cannot prevent non-smokers from breathing smoke perfectly. Even if separating a smoking section from a non-smoking section, two of them are still in the same restaurant. Thus non-smokers are not guarded from smoking air perfectly. In addition, clerks should also be considered. Even if there are a smoking section and a non-smoking section in the restaurant, it totally does not concern to the clerks. Therefore, the clerks cannot be guarded from smoke. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants helps smokers to try to stop smoking. If smoking is not accepted at restaurants, smokers cannot smoke at restaurants. I think it makes smokers think to try to stop smoking. It is very nice for their health. For these two reasons, I agree with this statement.",B2
"In American, most of American teenager have a part-time job. They can study and work together. Thinking of the American teenager are if they want something, they will get it by self. In Thailand, The Thai teenager are different from American. Because of the Thai social is family. Parents take care their children and almost they live together so it's not important to go out and work. All above I talk about the different of thinking of the American and Thai teenager. Today, I'm studying in the University. Everyday I have to use much money to buy anything such as foods, books, appliances, etc. Moreover I have to pay for many activities. A part-time job is the way can help our parents to reduce using money. Somebody are doing it now because he or she doesn't have money enough. I think it's unneccessary for poor people to doing it. Maybe Everybody should do a part-time job if you can because It is good and use free time creatively. The example for do a part-time job is work in the restuarant such as McDonald, KFC, Sizzler, MK or use your talents to make money for example ; if you can sing you should go to contest, if you can draw and paint you can make money by your work. You can do it everything you think that can help you make money. A part-time job is the way to help you get money even it isn't much more, but it's enough if you have economical life.",B1.1
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are some reasons why I agree with it. First reason is that we can meet many people with it. I work a part-time job now for a restaurant. I like my work and work members. Through the job, I could make friends with variety kind of people. I think I'm very happy to meet them. Then, I like to talk with my guests. They are very kind and interesting. So I think it is very nice to have a part-time job. Second, we can have a lot of good experience with a part-time job. Thanks to the job, I think I became able to talk with people who I don't know at all in spite of my shyness. Now I can talk to various people with smile. Also I learned the way of speaking to my guests. The way of speaking is very important when we work for an office or a company in the future. The last reason is that we can change our view of life or value. I made friends with many people whose generation is different from me. I learned there is a lot of way of thinking. I feel my view of life changed and now I send better life. I thank my job members. In this way, I agree with the statement. If my friends don't have part-time job, I want them to have it.",B1.1
"I believe that a college student should not be burdened with the responsibility of fiscal independence, and that none should assume that he should hold a part-time job during the course of his studies. I have three reasons to support my claim. Firstly, college is an essential part of the academically minded individual's growth and development. A high-school student generally focuses his academic attention of mastering basic skills, the foremost of which is learning how to think. In college, however, he begins to explore concepts in much greater detail and depth, engaging in activities of critical thought and analysis. Balancing the mundane realities of holding a part-time job will simply distract this level of focus, and hamstring the overall efficacy of his college experience. Secondly, College is an important time in the social and sexual growth an individual, and his time not spent studying is best taken up with developing himself in these ways in order to become a stable, confident and contributing member of society in later years. Finally, part-time work generally pays very little, so the actual financial gain from such work is almost negligible. His time is much better spent in academic and social activities in order to prepare him for his future social responsibilities. Besides, there will be plenty of time after college is finished to learn how to hold down a job and manage his finances.",C2
"I always meet somone who smokes cigarettes every where, so disturb. Actually I do not like someone who smoking in social area. Didn't they know that this act will disturb people around of him or maybe they know but they unrespect with human right. People around the smokers called passive smokers, as a people they also have their rights. Let me remind you again that smoke can cause a bad effect in out body. The younger the onset of smoking the longer one will most likely smoke and the younger one is more likely to die. Smoking is a slow killer, not just to the smoker but to those also around him as they are effected by second hand smoke. The life expectancy of the smoker is cut short by 10-12 years and more than half of all smoker die from smoking related disease. If you an active smokers and want to quit, now is the right time to stop. Planning to stop smoking or even just for cigarette habit has affected everyone at one time or other, directly or indirectly. if you do it now, you can make a big difference to your health and these smoking fact can be turned around. it is never too late to stop smoking and greatly benefit your health and today is a good day to stop.",B1.1
"I think that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because tobacco give very injurious to people. In the restaurants, people eat food so many people do not like smoking. Moreover, cleanliness of food is very important to people. In addition, passive smoking's give damage to others people. I want say three reasons that smoking must be banned at all the restaurants in the country. First, when eat food, people do not like smoking in the restaurants. Because foods eat taste and smell. In addition, smell of cigarette is disturbed to others people. Next cleanliness of food is very important. Food should always be clean and fresh. Therefore, taste of food is delicious. However, if the side table smoking, we think that is annoying and go out in the restaurants. Last passive smoking's give damage to others people. So smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. Passive smoking give very injurious to people. Also, passive smokers more injurious than smokers. In addition, Restaurants have a very narrow because there are people receive all the damage. Eventually, the damage caused by smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country. Also we must try to do not smoke in restaurant and should try to be considerate of others.",A2
"Yes it is important to have a part time job. A lot of people think that working while one is studying is tough work, that one's studies necessarily suffers. However, in my opinion I feel that having a part time job enriches one's life, not just in material terms, but in non-material terms. One takes away life's lessons, such as diligence, patience, team work and social skills. This benefits the person for the entirety of his life, and so it is always better to start early. College students are at the point of their lives where they are the most malleable in terms of their psychological outlook, so having them undergo some life lessons will definitely allow them to benefit for the rest of their life. The students also receive monetary benefits, which is always welcome, because tuition fees are always escalating, as with the cost of living and one's financial responsibility to support his/her aging parents. Therefore it is imperative that students, wherever possible and physically able-bodied, be able to contribute to the household income by working part time. One can also learn more skills on the job, and gain valuable contacts that can put him/her in good stead in future job hirings. In my opinion, some are born with a silver spoon, and will never work part time. These are people who will never gain an appreciation for life. ",B1.2
"Recently several bans, forbiding smoking in all restaurants, have been published, which brings heated discussion. As far as I'm concerned, to those bans I can't agree more. The reasons are just as followed:First and foremost, smoking is basically harmful to people's health, especially to the lung, which can contribute to fatal disease, such as cancer. Secondly, restaurant is a public occasion, smoking there can not only hurt smokers themselves, but also do harm to those surrounded. What's worse, while there is pregnant woman in the restaurant, the harm can be catastrophic. Thirdly, smoking can lead to quarrelling, which will destroy the harmony and influence consumers' mood in the restaurant. For there are also many non-smokers, even some smoking-sensitive people. Last but not least, even considering that several smokers have been addicted in smoking, there are still many other space out of restaurant provided for them. All in all, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurant in the country. In order to realize this aim, it is not enough that only the government publish some bans. Citizens, both smokers and non-smokers, are ought to join in this compaign. Smokers can remind themselves that it is banned to smoke in the restaurant when they have the desire to take a cigarette out. Non-smokers can advice those who want to smoke during dinner not to do that instesd of just tolerating or direct quarelling. Only in that way can smoking be completely banned in all reataurants in the country.",B1.2
"Banning smoking in restaurants and prohibiting smoking in all public spaces is long overdue in Japan. While they have imposed some bans, they have yet to take the vital step of including all public areas. I am certain that if a survey were to be contacted that around 4 out every six people would agree that smoking in restaurants should be banned. I smoke and even I don't like smoking and eating and I would never think of inflicting my cigarette fumes on to others and always look for a designated smoking area. I believe that out of such a survey, other smokers, like me, would also agree. I don't think that it is because all smokers don't care about others, I know that I do, but I choose to smoke for myself and I choose not cause discomfort to others because of my choices. There are many smokers who don't care and that is why I believe that governments should step in and lay the law down rather than wait. The longer that governments hesitate to act, the more people that will suffer and there is enough and has been enough of that already. People elect governments to govern and that is what they should do, govern prudently but firmly.",C2
"Several people do several jobs for their social and domestic needs. Some people do two or more jobs for their daily needs. Some people take overtime for their jobs due to increasing inflation day by day. Time is moving very fastly, there is a race between people of getting more and more wealth and honour. So they adopt different ways of getting them. The person who can not bear expenditure, moving towards part time job. Student living in hostel are commonly moved towards these type of jobs to get through their needs. Execess of Govt worker do part time jobs, because they have enough time for this. It is some ting need based. People do it in their necessity. When they need money. It requires their over time and extra labor. Part time job has many kinds like online job, tuition, coaching center etc. Students usually do tuitions or online jobs. Home tuitions are a good source of income for students. They teach there for 1 or 2 hours and earn handsome amount which is helpful for their expenditure. Govt. worker do other jobs like part time clerk. They earn some more money for their home. Part time job is a good thing to do.",B1.1
"Smoking, a heavy topic, which is always accompanied with sad stories. There is a larger and larger group of people ruined by cigarettes day by day. Some little kids lost their grandfathers, even fathers, just for some pieces of cigarettes! What's worse, a smoker may bring larger damage to people around him. So I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places, not only to earn the smoker himself a good body, but also give the cozy atmosphere back to the others. What's more, cigarettes are not cheap, because our country adds the tax percent to cigarettes to keep people away from it. So when smokes in public places, people may have a sense of compete. That is not good to social development. On the other hand, public places should be every citizen's not just some ones. Smoking is so bothering that it may influence people's moods. And it will also do badly to the environment. What's worse, the deserted cigarettes may bring serious effect to soil. And the less of cautious to put off the cigarettes when finished, may be a hidden danger, too. All in all, I think there are lots of benefits to forbid smoking in public places, if we really achieve the goal, we can have a more pleasant atmosphere, do good to public health and reduce hidden danger. We should call on everyone to push forward the course of smoking-forbidden.",B1.1
"To earn something by doing a job is good but it become more profitable when we do job while studying like college life. College life is full of luxuries life. Despite of having a short period of study it has its own charms but it can be more fruitful when we job with it. By doing job we can do something for our parents not that for their benefit but that thinking that we are lessening the burden from their shoulder. We have to quick in our duties, punctual, hardworking to do job in college life. Laziness is not favorable to do job quickness and alertness are major attributes to do job while studying in college. Be regular is another good habit for this activity that doing something especially we have to sacrifice something our rest and be regular meet the requirement. Punctuality is another charactistic to adopt for doing job. Even task which is done on the require time create no problem for the doer. Hard work is another essential part of human trait which has no its comparison when done with fall spirit. Through hard work we can achieve difficult and unachievable task.",B1.1
"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This is because having a part-time job will enable a student to experience what real life is like, and not be molly-coddled in the safe academic world. The point of going to college is to get an education, while academic knowledge is important, street smarts should not be neglected too. A part-time job is a good way for students to be more sophisticated about how the world works. Part-time jobs let the students earn pocket money too, which is a good way for students to learn about finance and also, lessen the financial burden on parents. Therefore, with the two main benefits explained above, gaining more experience about the world and earning pocket money at the same time, I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, the statement is not clear whether it is important for students to have a part-time job at all times or just sometimes. The latter position makes more sense. While having a job will no doubt benefit a student in terms of expanding his or her horizons, the basic duty of a student is still to academics. Hence it is better if the student only works at a part-time job during school holidays and the less-busy time of school, but focus on studies during exams. ",B2
"In modern life, more and more people are addicted in smoking. In china, smoking has been banned only in some limited public places. So, if you walk on the road or other public place, you will see many people smoking. But in fact, it is not healthy for people, especially the second-hand smoking. The second-hand smoking is the smoke that is breathed out by the smoking man. It is more harmful for people. It will increase the possibilities of having cancer or other disease in lung. In addition to the harmful aspect, smoking in public also expresses a bad image on others. Maybe someone thinks that it is cool to smoke. They look on smoking as a good way to show themselves. However, it is just a misunderstanding. Smoking will not brighten your image. On the contrary, it will bring you many negative influences. Finally, smoking does much harm to the environment. It will pollute the air. When we breathe the unclear air, we may well be ill. Smoking at a restaurant is harmful in particular. In a word, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As the less smoking we take, the healthier we will be.",B1.1
Smoking should be banned not only the country but all over the country. As success fully we have declared not to play cigarette commercials on tv. We are supposed to restrict the smokes to avoid smoking on public places. If we can hinder them to avoid smoking in family settings where children are usually present so question is why not in restaurants where we visit with our families. I think positive for your child or others should be same for others children individuals. In restaurants where we sit for eating drinking the dangerous smoke prevail around our food not only by breath but through our food in take. Some individuals are allergic to it and we can not agree to every one to stop smoking so its environment of the restaurants administration ban it for every person dining. Smoking is a poison who eat a person fastly. I through agree that the smoking should be banned over the country the factories where the cigarette and drugs made are should be banned. Good atmosphere is very important in hotels because these are clean and neat space. In so conclusion is it should banned in all public places and restaurants to avoid the risk of disputes and health factors.,B1.2
"Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the county. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country so it will be much safer in our environment. It will also benefit the smokers who will stop smoking and also for the others that do not smoke. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants so the customers can breathe easily without getting suffocated by the smoke of the cigarette being exhaled by the smokers. If smoking would be banned in all restaurants in our country it would be better for the food because it would be cleaner and much safer to eat because smoke has different particles that can cause the food to be dirty and spoiled. If the food is clean it would be safer for our health because the food we will eat is free from any smoke substance. If smoking would be banned in all restaurants it would lessen the habit of the smokers to smoke therefore it would also benefit them. If smoking will be banned, it will lessen the person who smokes. If smoking would be banned in all restaurants in the country then everybody will benefit from it because you can breathe freely with fresh air without being suffocated by the smoke of the cigarettes.",B1.2
"Nowadays, there are more and more students choose to have a part-time job in the spare time. Surely, a par-time job can provide cash and working experience to them. But, as far as I am concerned, the high school students should not be encouraged to take a part-time job due to the following reasons. A part-time job would occupy high school students a lot of precious time, which should be used to learn systematic knowledge and living skills in class without worries of work stress and frustration. Also the high schools provide students a community to fit in the real world, so that students can develop these necessary qualities and skills. I think it's definitely not a wise option to take a part-time job in exchange of losing some parts of such important opportunities of education. What's more, students in high school should get prepared to further their education in college, which could benefit them a lot. It's known to almost everyone that to become a college is one of the important ways to change one's life. On the contrary, a worker with only a high school diploma will have more difficulty in employment and promotion and a lot other issues in this era. In conclusion, I think our government and society should pay more attention to make sure that high school students could be able to have the best education without distraction of misleading and material addiction.",B1.1
"Personally, I don't think that it's terribly important for a college student to have a part time job. If he or she really needs the money in order to pay tuition or to get by without starving, then I would deem it important to find some kind of work. However, if finances are not an issue, I don't believe that it's important or necessary. Perhaps there are a lot of people who think that working is a great life experience and that by working a part time job, college students will better understand the value of a dollar and the value of hard work. Don't you think that the 40 to 45 years of having to work after graduating is enough time to get that experience? I do. The youth of today have so many pressures as it is. I don't think that adding to that, the pressure of a part time job while they are trying to prepare for the rest of their lives, pass exams, fit into social clicks, avoid drugs and social rejection will make them a better person. If it is at all possible, I believe we should let the youth of today focus on their studies and let them enjoy a less complicated life before they are thrown to the working dogs for the remainder of their working lives.",C2
"I think college student should have pat time job. Because we need much money at our school life. Especially for people living alone. Forexample I have lived alone since this spring in Kobe, but it costs me much money to just rend my room in apart near my college. And I must buy much vegetables, meets., fruits and rice every week at supermarket. When I live with my parents, it did not cost us a lot money because my parents are farmer. I have never bought such a many vegetables and frouits, so I feel them very expensive. And I am member of tennis cercle. We practice tennis at Osaka on every Sunday. I have to pay much fare to go there every week. In adition, I feel I want to go Sannnomiya to eat delisious lunch with my friends in the near future. Any way, we college students need much money to live good lives. However, if we are in trouble with money, our parents may rend money to us. I think we shoud not depend on our parents. I think now is the chance to learn how hard to make money, thank for parents, and be dependent of them. And we do not wastel money when we earn money on for myself. So we shoud have a part tme job, and experient many things.",B1.1
